   2.1 | The Merger 
---|--- 

(a) Endo, HoldCo, AcquireCo and Auxilium agree that the Merger shall
be implemented in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement.

(b) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, on the Closing Date, AcquireCo shall be
merged with and into Auxilium. At the Merger Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of AcquireCo shall cease and Auxilium shall continue as
the surviving company in the Merger (the "Surviving Company").

(c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on
the Closing Date, the parties to the Merger shall file with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware the Certificate of Merger, executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as
soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the
time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as HoldCo and Auxilium
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. At and immediately after
the Merger Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in the
Certificate of Merger and the DGCL.

(d) At the Merger Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of
Auxilium shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit A_
hereto and, as so amended, shall constitute the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law. The Parties shall take all actions necessary

 



-21-  so that the by-laws substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit B_
hereto shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company as of the Merger
Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

(e) The directors of the Surviving Company upon completion of the Merger
shall, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly appointed, elected and qualified, as the case
may be, consist of the directors of AcquireCo prior to the Merger Effective
Time. The officers of AcquireCo immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

(f) At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Parties or any of their respective shareholders:

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AcquireCo issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company. Each share of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AcquireCo issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted
into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Company. Each share of Redeemable Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AcquireCo issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive $0.01 per share.

 

(ii) Each Excluded Share outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under Section
2.1(k) and the DGCL.

 

(iii) Subject to Section 2.1(g), each Auxilium Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than (x) Auxilium
Shares owned by Endo, AcquireCo or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Endo and Auxilium Shares owned by Auxilium or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Auxilium, and in each case not held
on behalf of third parties (it being acknowledged and agreed by Auxilium that
it hereby waives the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
Auxilium Shares owned by Auxilium or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Auxilium), and (y) Auxilium Shares that are owned by
stockholders ("Dissenting Stockholders") who have perfected and not withdrawn
a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the
Auxilium Shares referred to in this clause (y) and the preceding clause (x)
being referred to herein collectively as "Excluded Shares") and (z) Restricted
Auxilium Shares (which shall be converted pursuant to Section 2.1(l)(ii))
shall be converted, at the election of the holder thereof in accordance with
Section 2.1(g)(iii)(A), into the right to receive:

(A) for each Auxilium Share with respect to which a Standard Election has
been made pursuant to Section 2.1(g)(iii)(A) and remains in effect at the
Election Deadline, (1) an amount in cash equal to the Cash Amount and (2) a
fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Endo Share equal
to the Exchange Ratio;

 



-22- (B) for each Auxilium Share with respect to which a Cash Election has been
made pursuant to Section 2.1(g)(iii)(A) and remains in effect at the Election
Deadline, an amount of cash equal to the Un-prorated Cash Election Amount;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Aggregate Cash Consideration would be
greater than the Maximum Cash Consideration, the consideration to be received
in respect of each Auxilium Share covered by Cash Elections shall
automatically be adjusted in accordance with Section 2.1(g)(iii)(D); and

 

(C) for each Auxilium Share with respect to which a Stock Election has been
made pursuant to Section 2.1(g)(iii)(A) and remains in effect at the Election
Deadline, a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Endo
Share equal to the Un-prorated Stock Election Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, if the Aggregate Stock Consideration would be greater than the Maximum
Stock Consideration, the consideration to be received in respect of each
Auxilium Share covered by Stock Elections shall automatically be adjusted in
accordance with Section 2.1(g)(iii)(D).

 

All such Auxilium Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time represented any such Auxilium
Share (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
including the right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.1(i), cash in lieu of
fractional Endo Shares, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective Time, the outstanding Endo
Shares or Auxilium Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Endo Shares),
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of Endo Shares or
Auxilium Shares, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide
to Auxilium and the holders of Auxilium Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

(g) The exchange of Certificates shall be effected as follows:

 

(i) Prior to the Election Form Mailing Date, HoldCo shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Auxilium to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration. At
or prior to the Merger Effective Time, Endo shall issue, fully paid, the Endo
Shares to be delivered as Merger Consideration and deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE II through the Exchange Agent, the aggregate cash
consideration and certificates representing the Endo Shares to be delivered as
Merger Consideration (or, if uncertificated Endo Shares will be delivered,
Endo shall make appropriate alternative arrangements).

 



-23- (ii) An election form in such form as HoldCo shall reasonably specify and as
shall be reasonably acceptable to Auxilium (the "Election Form") shall be
mailed on a date to be mutually agreed by HoldCo and Auxilium that is not more
than forty-five (45) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as HoldCo and Auxilium shall
mutually agree (the "Election Form Mailing Date") to each holder of record of
Auxilium Shares as of the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Election Form Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").
HoldCo shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be
requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners) of Auxilium Shares between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and
Auxilium shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(iii) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) of an
Auxilium Share, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section
2.1(g)(iii), to submit an election (each, an "Election") in accordance with
the following procedures:

 

(A) Each holder of an Auxilium Share may specify in a request made in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(g)(iii) whether such
holder elects to receive with respect to a specified number or all of such
holders Auxilium Shares (x) the consideration set forth in Section
2.1(f)(iii)(A) (such consideration, the "Standard Election Consideration" and
such Election with respect to such number of Auxilium Shares, the "Standard
Election"), (y) the consideration set forth in Section 2.1(f)(iii)(B) (such
consideration, the "Cash Election Consideration" and such Election with
respect to such number of Auxilium Shares, the "Cash Election"), or (z) the
consideration set forth in Section 2.1(f)(iii)(C) (such consideration, the
"Stock Election Consideration" and such Election with respect to such number
of Auxilium Shares, the "Stock Election").

(B) Any holder of an Auxilium Share who does not properly make an Election in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(g)(iii), or whose Election
is not received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline in the
manner provided in Section 2.1(g)(iii)(C), will be deemed to have made the
Standard Election.

(C) Any Election set forth in this Section 2.1(g)(iii) shall have been made
properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the Election
Deadline, an Election Form properly completed and signed indicating such
Election. Any holder of an Auxilium Share may, at any time prior to the
Election Deadline, change or revoke such holders Election by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a
properly completed and signed revised Election Form. HoldCo, in the exercise
of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations,
not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (x) the validity
of the Election Form and compliance by any holder of an Auxilium Share
with the Election procedures set forth herein and (y) the manner and extent
to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations
prescribed in Section 2.1(f). If HoldCo shall determine in its reasonable
discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any
Auxilium Share (it being understood that none of the Parties nor the Exchange
Agent is under any duty to notify any holder of any such defect), such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, subject to Section
2.1(g)(iii)(B).

 



-24- (D) Not later than five (5) days after the Election Deadline, HoldCo shall
cause the Exchange Agent to effect the following prorations to the Merger
Consideration:

(1) for each Auxilium Share with respect to which a Cash Election has been
made pursuant to Section 2.1(g)(iii)(A) and remains in effect at the Election
Deadline, if the Aggregate Cash Consideration would be greater than the
Maximum Cash Consideration, each Auxilium Share covered by a Cash Election
shall, instead of being converted into the right to receive the Un-prorated
Cash Election Amount, automatically be converted into the right to receive (I)
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the Un-
prorated Cash Election Amount multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be (1) the Maximum Cash Consideration and the denominator of which
shall be (2) the Aggregate Cash Consideration (such fraction, the "Cash
Fraction"), and (II) a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable Endo Share equal to the product of (x) the Un-prorated Stock
Election Ratio multiplied by (y) a fraction equal to one (1) _minus_ the
Cash Fraction; and

(2) for each Auxilium Share with respect to which a Stock Election has
been made pursuant to Section 2.1(g)(iii)(A) and remains in effect at the
Election Deadline, if the Aggregate Stock Consideration would be greater than
the Maximum Stock Consideration, each Auxilium Share covered by a Stock
Election shall, instead of being converted into the right to receive the Un-
prorated Stock Election Ratio, automatically be converted into the right to
receive (I) a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Endo
Share equal to the product of (x) the Un-prorated Stock Election Ratio
multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be (1) the Maximum
Stock Consideration and the denominator of which shall be (2) the Aggregate
Stock Consideration (such fraction, the "Stock Fraction") and (II) an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (x) the Un-prorated Cash Election Amount
multiplied by (y) a fraction equal to one (1) _minus_ the Stock Fraction.

 

(iv) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Merger Effective Time
(and in any event within four (4) Business Days after the Merger Effective
Time), HoldCo shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Auxilium Shares a form of letter of transmittal (the "Letter of
Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, shall be in such form and have such other
provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as
Auxilium may specify acting reasonably, and shall be prepared prior to the
Closing, together with instructions thereto.

 

(v) Upon (A) in the case of Auxilium Shares represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or (B)
in the case of

 



-25-  Auxilium Shares held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message"
by the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Auxilium Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which such
Auxilium Shares have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(f) (after taking
into account all Auxilium Shares then held by such holder and the Election(s)
made with respect to such Auxilium Shares by such holder). In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Auxilium Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of Auxilium, the applicable Merger Consideration may be
delivered to a transferee, if the Certificate representing such Auxilium Share
(or, if such Auxilium Share is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of
such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.1(g), each Auxilium Share, and any Certificate
with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Merger
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration that the holders of Auxilium Shares are entitled to
receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.1(f) (after taking
into account all Auxilium Shares then held by such holder and the Election(s)
made with respect to such Auxilium Shares by such holder).

(vi) The Merger Consideration delivered and credited as fully paid in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II, upon conversion of any Auxilium
Shares, shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Auxilium Shares. From and after the Merger
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of Auxilium Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If, after the
Merger Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Auxilium Shares
(or Auxilium Shares held in book-entry form) are presented to the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

 

(vii) Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to
the holders of Auxilium Shares for one year after the Merger Effective Time
shall be delivered to HoldCo or its designee, and any holder of Auxilium
Shares who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter
look only to HoldCo for its claim for the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof.

(viii) None of Auxilium, Endo, HoldCo, AcquireCo, the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(h) Each of Endo, HoldCo and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of Auxilium Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated as having been paid to the
holder of Auxilium Shares in respect of which such deduction or withholding
was made.

 



-26- (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional Endo
Shares will be issued and any holder of Auxilium Shares entitled to receive a
fractional Endo Share but for this Section 2.1(i) shall be entitled to receive
a cash payment in lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment
shall be determined by multiplying (i) the Endo Average Closing Price by (ii)
the fraction of an Endo Share (rounded to the nearest thousandth) to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(f)
(after taking into account all Auxilium Shares then held by such holder and
the Election(s) made with respect to such Auxilium Shares by such holder). The
amount of cash, if any, that each Auxilium Stockholder is entitled to receive
for the Auxilium Shares held by such Auxilium Stockholder is rounded to the
nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after aggregating
the cash amounts payable for all Auxilium Shares held by such Auxilium
Stockholder and any cash amount payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to this Section 2.1(i).

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by HoldCo, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as HoldCo may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

(k) No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive any Merger Consideration
with respect to the Auxilium Shares owned by such Person unless and until such
Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to
appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
Auxilium Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder, except that all Auxilium
Shares held by holders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively
shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Auxilium
Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Merger
Effective Time, the right to receive the same consideration (subject to the
same proration) as if such holders had not demanded appraisal rights and had
made the Standard Election. Auxilium shall give Endo (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by
Auxilium relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand
for appraisal under the DGCL. Auxilium shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Endo, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



-27- (l) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and, in any
event, prior to the Closing Date, the Auxilium Board of Directors or an
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions, if any, as may be required to effect and/or procure the following
treatment:

 

(i) Each Auxilium Option (that is not an Option granted under the ESPP) that
as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time is outstanding, whether
vested or unvested, shall, as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, be cancelled, and each holder of an Auxilium Option so cancelled
pursuant to this Section 2.1(l)(i) shall become entitled to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Auxilium
Shares subject to such Auxilium Option immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the positive difference, if any, between (x)
the Auxilium Closing Price, and (y) the exercise price per Auxilium Share
applicable to such Auxilium Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, less applicable withholding Taxes, if any. For the avoidance of doubt,
no holder of an Auxilium Option that has an exercise price per Auxilium Share
that is equal to or greater than the Auxilium Closing Price shall be entitled
to any payment with respect to such cancelled Auxilium Option before, on or
after the Merger Effective Time and all such Auxilium Options shall be
automatically cancelled for no consideration as of the Merger Effective Time.

(ii) Each issued and outstanding Auxilium Share subject to vesting or other
lapse restrictions pursuant to the Auxilium Share Plan immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time (a "Restricted Auxilium Share") shall, as of
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, be cancelled, and each holder
of a Restricted Auxilium Share so cancelled pursuant to this Section
2.1(l)(ii) shall become entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Auxilium Closing Price, less applicable withholding Taxes, if any.

(iii) Each stock-based award (including any restricted stock unit and deferred
stock unit awards), other than an Auxilium Option or Restricted Auxilium
Share ("Other Auxilium Share-Based Awards" and together with Restricted
Auxilium Shares, the "Auxilium Share Awards"), that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time, shall, whether vested or unvested, as of
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, be cancelled, and each holder
of an Other Auxilium Share-Based Award so cancelled pursuant to this Section
2.1(l)(iii) shall become entitled to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Auxilium Shares
subject to such Other Auxilium Share-Based Award multiplied by (ii) the
Auxilium Closing Price, less applicable withholding Taxes, if any. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) any Other Auxilium Share-Based Awards subject to
performance conditions for which the applicable performance period is not
complete as of the Merger Effective Time, shall vest and be earned based on
the greater of target or actual performance as of the Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ that, the vesting of such Other Auxilium Share-Based Awards shall
be subject to Endos review and approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of the calculations supporting Auxiliums applicable
performance determination, which shall be provided to Endo no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Merger Effective Time and (ii) any payment of
cash with respect to an Other Auxilium Share-Based Award that is "deferred
compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall vest at the
Merger Effective Time and be paid at the earliest time permissible under
Section 409A of the Code.

 



-28- (iv) The amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.1(l) to any current or
former employee of Auxilium or any of its Affiliates shall be paid through
Auxiliums (or its applicable Subsidiarys) payroll on the next regularly
scheduled payment date that occurs not less than three (3) Business Days
following the Closing Date. The amounts payable pursuant to this Section
2.1(l) to any person, other than a current or former employee of Auxilium or
any of its Affiliates, shall be paid by Endo or any affiliate of Endo
(including Auxilium and its Subsidiaries) within ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date.

(m) It is the intent of the Parties hereto that the treatment of Auxilium
Share Awards and Auxilium Options contemplated herein be in a manner that is
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including all
guidance and regulations issued thereunder.

 

(n) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Closing Date, the Auxilium Board of Directors or an
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the Auxilium
Employee Stock Purchase Program (the "ESPP"): (i) except for the
six (6)-month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on July 1, 2014,
no offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of
this Agreement; (ii) if the Closing Date shall occur prior to the end of the
offering period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement,
cause the rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any such offering
period then underway under the ESPP to be determined by treating the Closing
Date as the last day of such offering period and by making such other pro
rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period
but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP, in each case, in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP in effect on the date hereof; and (iii)
the ESPP shall terminate effective as of the Closing Date.

 

(o) Pursuant to the terms of the base and supplemental indentures, each dated
January 30, 2013, between Auxilium and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the "Convertible Notes Trustee"), as may be amended (the "Convertible Notes
Indenture"), after the Merger Effective Time, each holder of the Auxilium
Convertible Notes outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
will be entitled, subject to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes
Indenture, as supplemented by the Merger Supplemental Indenture, to (i)
convert such holders Auxilium Convertible Notes only into the right to
receive the Weighted Average Merger Consideration, (ii) require Auxilium to
repurchase such holders Auxilium Convertible Notes for cash or (iii) subject
to such modifications as may be required to comply with Irish or other
applicable Law, continue to hold such holders Auxilium Convertible Notes.

(p) After the Merger Effective Time, the holder of the Actient Warrant
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time will be entitled,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Actient Warrant, to receive, in
lieu of the Auxilium Shares theretofore deliverable upon the exercise of such
holders Actient Warrant had such Actient Warrant been exercised immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time, the amount and form of consideration
specified in the Actient Warrant.

 



-29- (q) Endo shall procure that no stamp duty shall be payable by the Auxilium
Stockholders in connection with the issue to the Auxilium Stockholders of the
Endo Shares as part of the Merger Consideration.



   2.2 | The Closing

The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of
Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 1888 Century Park East, 21st Floor, Los Angeles, CA

Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Laws) of the

conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of those
conditions); and (ii) the date that is the day prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ that the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII have been satisfied

shall, from and after the Merger Effective Time, have all of the effects
provided under applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this
Section 2.2, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date),
then the Closing shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a) any Business
Day during or before the expiration of the Marketing Period, as may be
specified by Endo on no fewer than three (3) Business Days prior written

the Parties shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the
SEC or the CBI (and, if applicable, any other Governmental Authority) (i) a
mutually acceptable proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted
to Auxilium Stockholders at the Auxilium Meeting, which will also be used as a

the Parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by any Party, and such information should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4

 



-31-  or any Irish Prospectus so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary

they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Parties and, to the extent required by Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be

   2.4 | Stockholder Meeting 
---|--- 

(a) Auxilium shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Auxilium Meeting in accordance with the constituent
documents of Auxilium and applicable Law as promptly as practicable following
the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective and the Proxy Statement has
been cleared by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining Auxilium Stockholder
Approval as required by the DGCL and this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless Auxilium shall have
effected an Auxilium Change of Recommendation in accordance with the terms of

proxy solicitation agents, and take all other actions reasonably requested by
Endo that are reasonably necessary to obtain Auxilium Stockholder Approval and

Meeting for the purpose of obtaining Auxilium Stockholder Approval, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Auxilium of such
obligation.

adjournment, postponement, delay or cancellation) the Auxilium Meeting

Auxilium shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone convening the
Auxilium Meeting if in the good faith judgment of the Auxilium Board of
Directors (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) the failure to
adjourn, delay or postpone the Auxilium Meeting could be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Auxilium Board of Directors
under applicable Laws or not allow sufficient time under applicable Laws for
the distribution of any required or appropriate supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement or Form S-4, (ii) if Auxilium shall have made a written
request as contemplated by Section 7.1(c)(iii) and the twenty (20) Business

have expired prior to the scheduled date of the Auxilium Meeting, Auxilium
shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone convening the Auxilium

Letter only to the extent the relevance of such item to such other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on its face) or the Auxilium Public
Disclosure Record (other than any disclosure contained under the
captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" or similar captions
and any other disclosure contained therein that is predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature), Auxilium represents and warrants to and in favor

validly exists and is in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of

-33-  jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation and has the
requisite corporate, legal or other power and authority to own its assets as
now owned and to carry on its business as it is now being carried on.
Auxilium and each of the Auxilium Subsidiaries is duly qualified to carry on
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature or character of the
respective properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it, or the
nature of its business or activities, makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected
to be material to Auxilium and the Auxilium Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Auxilium has provided to Endo true, complete and correct copies of the
constituent documents of each of Auxilium and Auxiliums Subsidiaries, in each
case as amended.

 

(b) _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Auxilium has the requisite
corporate power, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and

obligations hereunder and to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the completion by
Auxilium of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly
authorized by the Auxilium Board of Directors and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Auxilium are necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery by it of this Agreement or, subject to obtaining the Auxilium
Stockholder Approval as contemplated in this Agreement, the completion by

(i) such filings and other actions required under applicable U.S. Securities
Laws and the rules and policies of NASDAQ, in each case, as are contemplated
by this Agreement;

(ii) the Required Regulatory Approvals; and

 

(iii) any other authorizations, licenses, Permits, certificates,
registrations, consents, approvals and filings and notifications with
respect to which the failure to obtain or make the same would not reasonably

reasonably be expected to prevent or significantly impede or materially delay
the completion of the Merger. 

(d) _No Violation_. Subject to obtaining the authorizations, consents and
approvals and making the filings referred to in Section 3.1(c) and complying

Permit held by Auxilium or any of the Auxilium Subsidiaries or in the creation

indebtedness of Auxilium or any of Auxiliums Subsidiaries having the right to

(whether equity or debt) in any other Person, other than an Auxilium
Subsidiary, which interest or investment is material to Auxilium and the
Auxilium Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



-36- (g) _Securities Laws Matters_.

 

(i) The Auxilium Shares are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the 1934
Exchange Act and with NASDAQ. Neither the SEC nor any state regulatory
authority has issued any order preventing or suspending trading of any
securities of Auxilium, and Auxilium is in compliance in all material respects
with applicable U.S. Securities Laws.

 

(ii) Auxilium is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements
of NASDAQ for continued listing of the Auxilium Shares thereon. Except for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Auxilium has not taken any
action designed to terminate, or likely to have the effect of terminating, the
registration of the Auxilium Shares under the 1934 Exchange Act or the listing
of such shares on NASDAQ.

(iii) Trading in Auxilium Shares on NASDAQ is not currently halted or
suspended. No delisting, suspension of trading or cease trading order with
respect to any securities of Auxilium is pending or, to the knowledge of
Auxilium, threatened. To the knowledge of Auxilium, as of the date of this
Agreement, no inquiry, review or investigation (formal or informal) of
Auxilium by the SEC or similar regulatory authority or NASDAQ is in effect or
ongoing or expected to be implemented or undertaken.

 

(iv) Except as set forth above in this Section 3.1(g), neither Auxilium nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to continuous disclosure or other public
reporting requirements under any securities Laws.

(v) Since December 31, 2011, Auxilium has timely filed all forms, reports,
statements and documents, including financial statements and managements
discussion and analysis required to be filed by Auxilium under applicable U.S.
Securities Laws and the rules and policies of NASDAQ. The documents in
the Auxilium Public Disclosure Record, as at the respective dates filed, were
in compliance in all material respects with applicable U.S. Securities Laws
and, where applicable, the rules and policies of NASDAQ.

 

(vi) None of the documents in the Auxilium Public Disclosure Record, as of
their respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(h) _Financial Statements_.

 

(i) The Auxilium Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with those of previous periods and in
accordance with applicable Laws, except as otherwise stated in the notes to
such statements or in the auditors report thereon and subject, in the case of
the Auxilium Interim Financial Statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments, which are not material to Auxilium and the Auxilium

 



-37-  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, individually or in the aggregate, and may
omit notes which are not material and are not required by applicable Laws or
U.S. GAAP. The Auxilium Financial Statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
operations, consolidated statements of stockholders equity and consolidated
statements of cash flows of Auxilium and the Auxilium Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods set forth therein.
There are no outstanding loans made by Auxilium or any of the Auxilium
Subsidiaries to any director or officer of Auxilium. All of such documents
in the Auxilium Public Disclosure Record (including any financial statements
included or incorporated by reference therein), as of their respective dates
(and as of the date of any amendment to the respective document in the
Auxilium Public Disclosure Record), complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Securities Act and the
1934 Exchange Act.

 

(ii) Auxilium has designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
them to be designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance that material
information relating to Auxilium is made known to its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer by others within Auxilium and the Auxilium
Subsidiaries. 

(iii) Auxilium has designed such internal controls over financial reporting,
or caused them to be designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Auxilium, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To
the knowledge of Auxilium, since December 31, 2011: (A) except as set forth
on Section 3.1(h)(iii) of the Auxilium Disclosure Letter, there have been no
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of, or material weaknesses
in, the internal controls over financial reporting of Auxilium that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Auxiliums ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) there is and has been no
fraud, whether or not material, involving management or any other employees
who have a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting
of Auxilium. To the knowledge of Auxilium, since December 31, 2011, Auxilium
has received no (x) complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal
accounting controls or auditing matters or (y) written reports from employees
of Auxilium regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.

 

(i) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Auxilium and the Auxilium Subsidiaries have
no liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be disclosed on a balance
sheet (or the footnotes thereto) prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, other
than (i) liabilities and obligations disclosed in the Auxilium
Public Disclosure Record, (ii) liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business (other than those specifically disclosed in the
Auxilium Public Disclosure Record) that would not reasonably be expected to be
material to Auxilium and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than those
disclosed in the Auxilium Public Disclosure Record), (iii) liabilities under
Contracts (other than any such liability resulting from a breach or default
thereunder) and (iv) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting anything set forth herein, the Auxilium

 



-38-  Financial Statements reflected and continued to reflect, in each case as of
the date filed, appropriate reserves under U.S. GAAP for contingent
liabilities relating to pending or anticipated litigation and other
contingent obligations of Auxilium and the Auxilium Subsidiaries.

(j) _Absence of Certain Changes_. From the date of the most recent Auxilium
Annual Financial Statements to the date of this Agreement, (i) no result,
fact, change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or development has
occurred or arisen which has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Auxilium and
(ii) Auxilium and each of the Auxilium Subsidiaries has conducted its business
in all material respects in the ordinary course of business.

 

(k) _Compliance with Laws_. Since December 31, 2011, the business of Auxilium
and of each of the Auxilium Subsidiaries has been and is currently being
conducted in material compliance with all applicable Laws, Orders and
Regulatory Guidelines and neither Auxilium nor any Auxilium Subsidiary has
received any written notice of any alleged material non-compliance or
violation of any such Laws, Orders or Regulatory Guidelines. Neither Auxilium
nor any of the Auxilium Subsidiaries has taken or committed to take any action
which would cause Auxilium or any of the Auxilium Subsidiaries to be in
violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Corruption
of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada) or any applicable Laws of similar
effect, and, to the knowledge of Auxilium, no such action has been taken by
any Person acting on behalf of Auxilium or any of the Auxilium Subsidiaries.

(l) _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding against or involving Auxilium or any
of the Auxilium Subsidiaries (whether in progress, pending or, to the
knowledge of Auxilium, threatened) that, if adversely determined, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Auxilium or would
prevent or significantly impede or materially delay the completion of the
Merger and, to the knowledge of Auxilium, no event or circumstance has
occurred which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
Proceeding. Neither Auxilium nor any of the Auxilium Subsidiaries nor any
of their respective properties or assets is subject to any outstanding Order
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or significantly impede or
materially delay the completion of the Merger or have a Material Adverse
Effect on Auxilium.

 

(m) _Real Property_. Section 3.1(m) of the Auxilium Disclosure Letter contains
(a) a list of all leases and subleases pursuant to which Auxilium or any
Auxilium Subsidiary currently leases real property as tenant (the "Real
Property Leases") and (b) a list of all real property owned by Auxilium or any
Auxilium Subsidiary ("Owned Real Property"). Each Real Property Lease is a
valid leasehold, sublease interest or comparable right, and Auxilium or one of
the Auxilium Subsidiaries holds good, valid and marketable beneficial and
legal title to the Owned Real Property. There is no pending or, to the
knowledge of Auxilium, threatened condemnation or expropriation proceedings
with respect to any Owned Real Property. There are no outstanding options or
rights of first refusal to purchase any Owned Real Property (or any portion
thereof or interest therein). Except for Permitted Liens, there are no Liens
registered against any Owned Real Property.

material respects with applicable Canadian Securities Laws and U.S. Securities
Laws and, where applicable, the rules and policies of the TSX and NASDAQ.

(vi) None of the documents in the Endo Public Disclosure Record, as of their
respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
hereof, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(h) _Financial Statements_. __

(i) The Endo Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with those of previous periods and in

the Endo Interim Financial Statements, to year-end audit adjustments, which
are not material individually or in the aggregate, and may omit notes which

Endo Annual Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations,
consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated
statements of cash flows of Endo and the Endo Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods set forth therein.

their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective
document in the Endo Public Disclosure Record), complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Securities Act
and the 1934 Exchange Act.

 

(ii) Endo has designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused them
to be designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief

-55- (iii) Endo has designed such internal controls over financial reporting, or
caused them to be designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Endo, to provide reasonable assurance

financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To
the knowledge of Endo, since December 31, 2011: (i) except as set forth on
Section 3.2(h)(iii) of the Endo Disclosure Letter, there have been no
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of, or material
weaknesses in, the internal controls over financial reporting of Endo that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Endos ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) there is and has been
no fraud, whether or not material, involving management or any other
employees who have a significant role in the internal control over financial
reporting of Endo. To the knowledge of Endo, since December 31, 2011, Endo has

accounting controls or auditing matters or (y) written reports from employees
of Endo regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.

 

(i) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Endo and the Endo Subsidiaries have no
liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent

the footnotes thereto) prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, other than (i)
liabilities and obligations disclosed in the Endo Public Disclosure Record,
(ii) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than those disclosed in the Endo
Public Disclosure Record), (iii) liabilities under Contracts (other than any
such liability resulting from a breach or default thereunder) and (iv)
liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting anything set
forth herein, the Endo Financial Statements reflected and continued to
reflect, in each case as of the date filed, appropriate reserves under U.S.
GAAP for contingent liabilities relating to pending or anticipated litigation
and other contingent obligations of Endo and the Endo Subsidiaries.

 

(j) _Absence of Certain Changes_. From the date of the most recent Endo Annual

change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or development has occurred or
arisen which has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Endo and (ii) Endo and each of
the Endo Material Subsidiaries has conducted its business in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business.

 

(k) _Compliance with Laws_. Since December 31, 2011, the business of Endo and

neither Endo nor any Endo Material Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of Endo,
any other Endo Subsidiary, has received any written notice of any alleged
material non-compliance or violation of any such Laws, Orders or Regulatory
Guidelines, except where any failure of compliance would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Endo.

 



-56- (l) _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding against or involving Endo or any of
the Endo Material Subsidiaries (whether in progress, pending or, to the
knowledge of Endo, threatened) that, if adversely determined, would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Endo or would prevent or significantly impede or
materially delay the completion of the Merger and, to the knowledge of Endo,
no event or circumstance has occurred which would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such Proceeding. Neither Endo nor any of the Endo Material

significantly impede or materially delay the completion of the Merger or (ii)
have a Material Adverse Effect on Endo.

prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Endo nor any of its affiliates
has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to
the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than
as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter and the fee letters related
thereto that could adversely affect the availability of the Financing on the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the commitments contained in the
Financing Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of Endo and, to the knowledge of Endo, each other party thereto, subject to
the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other
Laws of general application relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and to general principles of equity.

(ii) Endo has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably constitute a breach or default on the part of Endo or, to the
knowledge of Endo, any other party thereto under the Financing Commitment
Letter and Endo has no reason to believe that it or any other party thereto
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Financing
Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing, other than the Financing Conditions.
Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and
warranties of Auxilium contained in this Agreement and assuming the
performance in all material respects by Auxilium and each of the Auxilium
Subsidiaries of their respective obligations hereunder, as of the date
hereof, Endo has no reason to believe that (A) any of the Financing Conditions
required to be satisfied by Endo will not be satisfied or (B) the Financing
will not be made available to Endo on the Closing Date. 

 



-60- (iii) Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the representations
and warranties of Auxilium contained in this Agreement and assuming the
performance in all material respects by Auxilium and each of the Auxilium
Subsidiaries of their respective obligations hereunder, the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter, when added together with
available cash of Endo and Auxilium, will be sufficient for Endo and the
Surviving Company to fund the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date, to
refinance the Auxilium Credit Agreement, to fund the payments required in
accordance with Section 2.1(l), to fund payments required under the Actient
Warrants and Auxilium Warrants and in connection with the Auxilium Convertible
Notes and to pay related fees and expenses payable by AcquireCo or
the Surviving Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Endo
or any of its Affiliates be a condition to any of Endos or AcquireCos
obligations hereunder.

(r) _Required Vote_. The only vote of Endo required to adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger is the approval of the Endo Board of Directors. No
other vote of the stockholders of Endo is required by Law, the constituent
documents of Endo or otherwise to adopt this Agreement and approve
the Merger.

(s) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Endo nor any of its Subsidiaries has used
any broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
except that Endo has engaged Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Lazard Freres and
Co. LLC as its financial advisors, and no other broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any fee or commission from Endo or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and no
other Person is or may become entitled to receive any fee or other amount from
Endo or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(t) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties made by Endo in this Section 3.2, neither Endo nor any other
Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Endo or any Endo Material Subsidiary or their respective businesses, assets,
operations, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and
Endo hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties. In
particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, except for the
representations and warranties made by Endo in this Section 3.2, neither Endo
nor any other Person makes or has made any representation or warranty to
Auxilium or any of its Representatives, with respect to (i) any financial
projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospective information relating to
Endo, any Endo Material Subsidiary or their respective businesses or
operations or (ii) any oral or written information furnished or made available
to Auxilium or any of its Representatives in the course of their due
diligence investigation of Endo, the negotiation of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
accuracy, completeness or currency thereof, and neither Endo nor any other
Person will have any liability to Auxilium or any other Person in respect of
such information, including any subsequent use of such information, except in
the case of fraud. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Endo acknowledges and agrees that none of Auxilium or any other
Person has made or is making any representations or warranties whatsoever,
express or implied, beyond those expressly made by Auxilium in Section 3.1,
including any implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Auxilium furnished or made available
to Endo, or any of its Representatives.

 



-61- ---|--- 

The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement
will not survive the completion of the Merger and will expire and be
terminated on the earlier of the Merger Effective Time and, subject to the
obligation to make any payment hereunder pursuant to Section 7.2, the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. This Section
3.3 will not limit any covenant or agreement of any of the Parties, which, by
its terms, contemplates performance after the Closing or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated, as the case may be.

ARTICLE 5

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_



   5.1 | Access to Information; Cooperation 
---|--- 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws and Orders and the terms of
any existing Contracts, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective
wholly owned Subsidiaries to, afford to the other Parties and their respective
Representatives, until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, continuing access to the other

 



-66-  parties virtual data rooms, and reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to its businesses, properties, books and
records and such other data and information as a Party may reasonably
request, as well as to the other Partys and its Subsidiaries personnel,
subject, however, to such access not unreasonably interfering with the
ordinary conduct of its businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
terms of any Law, Order or Contract shall limit a Partys right to access the
information pursuant to this Section 5.1, the other Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain any consents from a third party
to provide such access or information or (ii) develop an alternative to
providing such access or information to a Party so as to address such lack of
access or information in a manner reasonably acceptable to the receiving
Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing shall
not require any disclosure that would reasonably be expected, as a result of
such disclosure, to have the effect of causing the waiver of any privilege
(including the attorney-client and work product privileges). Without limiting
the generality of the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, each of the
Parties acknowledges that all information provided to it under this Section
5.1, or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, is subject to the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement. If
any provision of this Agreement otherwise conflicts or is inconsistent with
any provision of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the provisions of this
Agreement will supersede those of the Non-Disclosure Agreement but only to
the extent of the conflict or inconsistency and all other provisions of the
Non-Disclosure Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

 

(b) Prior to Closing, Auxilium shall provide reasonable cooperation and shall
cause its respective wholly owned Subsidiaries and its and
their representatives, including management, officers, employees, directors,
legal, non-legal and accounting advisors and auditors to provide reasonable
cooperation to Endo in obtaining the Financing or any Replacement Financing,
including:

 

(i) promptly furnishing Endo and the Financing Sources with the Required
Information and with such other information and documentation required under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations;

(ii) promptly furnishing Endo with financial and other pertinent information
regarding Auxilium and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in
writing by Endo and that is reasonably available to Auxilium, including all
financial statements and financial and other data of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the 1933 Securities Act for registered
offerings of debt securities, and of the type and form customarily included in
offering documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of the 1933
Securities Act (including pro forma financial information), and other
documents required to satisfy any customary negative assurance opinion to
consummate the Financing or any Replacement Financing at Closing, including
all information and data necessary to satisfy any conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letter or any related engagement letter, the Debt
Financing Documents, any commitment letter in respect of a Replacement
Financing or Replacement Financing Documents;

 



-67- (iii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including one-on-one
meetings or conference calls with parties acting as agents or arrangers for,
and prospective lenders of, the Financing or any Replacement Financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and
reasonably cooperating with marketing or solicitation efforts of Endo, in each
case in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any Replacement
Financing, including by consenting to the use of Auxiliums and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection therewith; _provided_ that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage Auxilium or any of its Subsidiaries;

 

(iv) reasonably assisting with the timely preparation of materials for rating
agency and lender presentations, offering documents, bank information
memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
required in connection with the Financing or Replacement Financing;

 

(v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and
legal opinions at the expense of and as reasonably requested by Endo;

(vi) reasonably cooperating with Endos legal counsel in connection with any
legal opinion that such legal counsel may be required to deliver in
connection with the Financing or any Replacement Financing; and

(vii) taking all corporate or other actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing or
any Replacement Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made
available to Endo, including assisting in the preparation of and executing
one or more credit agreements (or amendments thereto), pledge and security
documents (or amendments thereto), guarantees, indentures, purchase
agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements and other definitive
documentation, certificates, representation letters, authorization letters
and related deliverables relating to the Financing or any Replacement
Financing, arranging for payoff letters and lien and guarantee releases with
respect to existing indebtedness and reasonably facilitating the provision of
guarantees, the grant (and perfection) of a security interest in collateral
and the provision of related lender protections.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no obligation of Auxilium or its Subsidiaries
under any such financing arrangements or other arrangements required to be
undertaken by Auxilium or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)
shall be effective until the Closing. None of Auxilium, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates shall be required to bear any cost or expense
or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing or any Replacement Financing prior to the
Closing. Endo shall upon request by Auxilium advance all material, reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Auxilium or any Auxilium Subsidiary in
connection with any actions taken by Auxilium or an Auxilium Subsidiary or,
promptly upon request by Auxilium, reimburse Auxilium or the Auxilium
Subsidiaries for all reasonable fees and expenses (including any professional
fees and expenses) and Taxes incurred by Auxilium and the Auxilium
Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing or any Replacement Financing.
Endo shall indemnify Auxilium and the Auxilium Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives for any and all Taxes, liabilities, losses,
damages, claims,

 



-68-  costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of their co-
operation or assistance with or participation in any matter under this
Section 5.1(b). No director, officer, employee or agent of Auxilium or any
Auxilium Subsidiary shall be required, in connection with any such matter, to
take any action in any capacity other than as a director, officer, employee
or agent of Auxilium or the Auxilium Subsidiaries, as the case may be. The
covenants contained in this Section 5.1(b) are intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Representatives and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and
other legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights which a Representative has under Law, Contract or otherwise, and shall
be binding on Endo and its successors and assigns.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1(b), none of Auxilium, the
Auxilium Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be required
to take any action which would, in the opinion of Auxilium, acting reasonably:

(i) create enforceable obligations of any of Auxilium or its Subsidiaries
under any financing arrangements, or other arrangements required to be
undertaken by Auxilium or its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 5.1(b), prior
to the Closing;

 

(ii) require Auxilium to obtain the approval of the Auxilium Stockholders;

 

(iii) unreasonably interfere in the operations of Auxilium or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Merger Effective Time; or

 

(iv) require Auxilium or any Auxilium Subsidiary to contravene any applicable
Laws or their respective organizational documents or breach any Contract of
Auxilium or its Subsidiaries,

and no such action taken at Endos request will be considered in determining
whether a representation, warranty or covenant of Auxilium hereunder has been
breached or whether a condition precedent to the Merger has been satisfied, it
being acknowledged by Endo that any such actions could require the consent of
third parties under applicable Contracts of Auxilium or its Subsidiaries.

(d) Endo shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on or prior to the
Closing Date on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letter, including: (i) maintaining in effect and enforcing the Financing
Commitment Letter and complying with its obligations thereunder; (ii)
satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions applicable to Endo that
are within Endos control (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of
Auxiliums failure to furnish information required to be delivered under this
Section 5.1 or otherwise comply with its obligations hereunder); (iii)
negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that
reflect the terms contained in the Financing Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto); and (iv) drawing the full amount of
the Financing, in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 8.1
and Section 8.2 and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon
funding, would be

 



-69-  satisfied. Endo shall give Auxilium prompt notice of any material breach or
threatened breach of the Financing Commitment Letter by any party to the
Financing Commitment Letter of which Endo becomes aware. Without limiting
Endos other obligations under this Section 5.1, if all or any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable, Endo shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain alternative financing from alternative Financing Sources on terms
(including conditionality) not materially less beneficial in the aggregate to
Endo than the terms contained in the Financing Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof, with lenders reasonably satisfactory to Endo, in an amount
sufficient, when added to the available cash and marketable securities of Endo
and Auxilium and any portion of the Financing that is available, to pay the
Merger Consideration on the Closing Date, to refinance the Auxilium Credit
Agreement, to fund the payments required in accordance with Section 2.1(l),
to fund payments required under the Actient Warrants and Auxilium Warrants and
in connection with the Auxilium Convertible Notes and to pay related fees and
expenses payable by AcquireCo or the Surviving Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, if and when obtained,
provide Auxilium with a copy of any new financing commitment that provides for
such alternative financing. Endo shall not, without Auxiliums prior written
consent, agree to any of the following amendments or modifications to, or any
of the following waivers of any provision or remedy under, the Financing
Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document: (I) any amendment,
modification or waiver that could reasonably be expected to (x) materially
adversely affect the ability of Endo or AcquireCo to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) make the timely funding of
the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing
less likely to occur, (II) any amendment, modification or waiver to the
Financing Conditions, unless such amendment, modification or waiver results
in conditions that are in the aggregate substantially equivalent (or that are
more favorable to Endo) when compared to those set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (III) any amendment, modification or
waiver that reduces the amount of the Financing or (IV) any amendment,
modification or waiver that materially adversely affects the ability of Endo
or its Affiliates to enforce their rights against the other parties to the
Financing Commitment Letter or such Debt Financing Documents. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Endo and AcquireCo may replace or amend the Financing
Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Financing
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Endo shall keep Auxilium reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to obtain
the Financing.

 

(e) Endo shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect of other
debt financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or
alternative bona fide third-party financing sources so long as (i) all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
debt financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to funding of
such debt financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding,
substantially equivalent to the Financing Conditions and (ii) prior to funding
of any loans thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt financing are
subject to restrictions on assignment that are in the aggregate substantially
equivalent to or more favorable to Endo than the corresponding restrictions
set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter (any such debt or equity
financing which satisfies the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the
"Replacement Financing"; the definitive documentation for any such Replacement
Financing, the "Replacement Financing Documents"). The representations,
warranties, covenants and other

 



-70-  restrictions of Endo and AcquireCo contained in this Agreement with respect
to the Financing and the Financing Commitment Letter shall apply equally to
any Replacement Financing and Replacement Financing Documents.



   5.2 | Consents and Approvals 
---|--- 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section
5.2(e)), each Party shall, and shall cause its wholly owned Subsidiaries to,

the other Party in doing, all things required or reasonably necessary to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

by this Agreement and thereafter make any other required or appropriate
submissions including, without limiting the foregoing, all filings and
submissions required in connection with the Required Regulatory Approvals; and

(iii) as promptly as practicable, take reasonable actions to provide notice
to any third party, or obtain from any third party any waivers, consents and
approvals, required or reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Endo and Auxilium or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay,
prior to the Closing, any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third
party for any waiver, consent or approval required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In no event
shall the receipt of any such third party waiver, consent or approval (other
than the Required Regulatory Approvals) be a condition to any Partys
obligations hereunder.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, including Section 5.2(e),
each of the Parties agrees, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
provide such notices and obtain such waivers, consents, clearances and
approvals as are required or reasonably necessary to consummate the

federal, provincial, state or foreign Law designed to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions relating to monopolization or restraint of trade or
foreign investment (collectively, "Relevant Laws"), and (ii) respond to any
requests of any Governmental Authority for information or documentary
material under any Relevant Law, and to contest and resist any action,
including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the

 



-71-  transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Relevant Law. The
Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
or proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Relevant Law prior to their submission.

(c) Each of Endo and Auxilium shall, other than in respect of routine
correspondence and dealings with the TSX and NASDAQ regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) promptly advise each other of
any written or oral substantive communication (including substantive
communications received by their respective Subsidiaries) from any
Governmental Authority or third party from whom a waiver, consent or approval
is required or reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) not participate in any meeting or
substantive discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend; and (iii) promptly furnish the other
Party with copies of all substantive correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their Subsidiaries and Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that materials may be redacted as necessary to address
reasonable privilege, competitively sensitive information or confidentiality
concerns.

(d) Each Party will provide as promptly as practicable such information and
documentary material as may be requested by a Governmental Authority following
any such filing or notification.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants contained in
this Section 5.2, but subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.2(e),
each of Endo and Auxilium agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by
its Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made
(including by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve
any objections that a Governmental Authority may assert under any Relevant Law
with respect to the Merger, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Relevant Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger, so as to enable the Merger Effective
Time to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the
Outside Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of Endo or Auxilium (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any Joint Venture held by Endo or
Auxilium (or any of their respective Subsidiaries), (ii) creating,
terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of Endo or Auxilium or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii)
otherwise taking or committing to take any action that would limit Auxiliums
or Endos freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of Endo or Auxilium (including any of their
respective Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to obtain
all waivers, consents, clearances or approvals required directly or
indirectly under any Relevant

 



-72-  Law or to avoid the commencement of any action by a Governmental Authority
to prohibit the Merger under any Relevant Law, or to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any Order in any Proceeding seeking to prohibit
the Merger or delay the Merger Effective Time beyond the Outside Date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall require, or be deemed to require, Endo or Auxilium (or any of
their Subsidiaries) to take any action, agree to take any action or consent to
the taking of any action (including with respect to selling, holding separate
or otherwise disposing of any business or assets or conducting its (or
their Subsidiaries) business in any specified manner) if doing so would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on either Endo or Auxilium (any such action that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, a "Restraint").

existing in favor of the present and former directors and officers of Auxilium
or of any of its Subsidiaries (each such present or former director or officer
of Auxilium being referred to as an "Indemnified Party" and such Persons
collectively being referred to as the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in
the constituent documents of Auxilium or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Contract by which Auxilium or any of its Subsidiaries is bound and which is
in effect as of the date hereof, will survive the completion of the Merger and
continue in full force and effect and without modification, with respect to
actions or omissions of the Indemnified Parties occurring prior to the
Closing.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Merger Effective Time
for not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date, each of Endo and the
Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including advancing
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, subject to the indemnifying or
advancing partys receipt of an unsecured undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party to repay such funds if it is ultimately determined in a
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any Proceeding arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred

officers liability policies currently maintained by Auxilium, but providing
coverage for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with respect to
claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred on or prior
to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Endo be required to spend premiums for any of the insurance referenced
in this Section 5.5(c) to the extent it would exceed 300% of Auxiliums
current annual premium for directors and officers liability insurance, in
which case Endo shall purchase the maximum amount of insurance available up
to the foregoing premium limit.

 



-74- (d) If Endo or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, Endo shall
ensure that any such successor or assign assumes all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.5.

(e) The obligations of Endo and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.5
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom
this Section 5.5 applies, without the written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 5.5 applies and their respective heirs,
executors, administrators and other legal representatives shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.5, each of whom may enforce the provisions of
this Section 5.5). Endo shall pay all expenses, including reasonable

with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 5.5;
_provided_ that such Indemnified Party prevails in such enforcement action.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors of
Auxilium by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement.

---|--- 

Prior to the Closing, Endo and Auxilium shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause (a) any dispositions of Auxilium Shares (including

individual who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the 1934 Exchange Act with respect to Auxilium immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934
Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions of Endo Shares (including derivative

of issuance, prior to the Closing.

(b) Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with each other in taking, or
causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Auxilium Shares from

(b) If any anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or may
become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
the Parties and its respective Affiliates shall (i) grant such approvals and
take all such actions as are legally permissible so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and (ii) otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the Merger and the

shall take all actions required by the terms of the Convertible Notes
Indenture as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
including without limitation the giving of any notices that may be required
in connection with the convertibility of Auxilium Convertible Notes.

(b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, as contemplated by the Convertible
Notes Indenture, each of Auxilium and Endo shall execute and deliver to the
Convertible Notes Trustee a supplemental indenture (the "Merger Supplemental
Indenture"), which will provide that, effective at the Merger Effective Time,
each outstanding Auxilium Convertible Note shall no longer be convertible into
Auxilium Shares and shall be convertible solely into the Weighted Average
Merger Consideration and any other payments under this Agreement that
the holders of such Auxilium Convertible Notes are entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger upon conversion in accordance with the Convertible
Notes Indenture, and each shall deliver to the Convertible Notes Trustee (with
copies to each Party hereto) any legal opinions, officers certificates or
other documents or instruments required by the Convertible Notes Trustee in
connection therewith.

 

(c) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Auxilium shall take all actions
required in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture to
permit the Merger, including the delivery to the Convertible Notes Trustee of
the legal opinion, officers certificates and any other documents or
instruments required under the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture
in connection with the consummation of the Merger. Upon the request of
Auxilium, Endo shall cooperate with Auxilium in good faith and use
commercially reasonable efforts in connection with Auxiliums compliance with
this Section 5.9(c).

 

(d) Subsequent to the Merger Effective Time, Endo shall cause Auxilium to take
all actions required by the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, as
supplemented by the Merger Supplemental Indenture, as a result of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, those required as a result of the Merger constituting
a "Fundamental Change" and/or a "Make-Whole Fundamental Change," as such
terms are defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture.

 



-76- (e) Upon the request of Endo, Auxilium shall execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, at the Closing, any other supplemental indentures,
legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or instruments (in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Auxilium) required for the due
assumption of Auxiliums outstanding debt, guarantees, securities and other
agreements, or the satisfaction and discharge thereof, in each case to the
extent required by Irish or other applicable Law and/or the terms of such
debt, guarantees, securities or other agreements. 

(f) Upon the request of Endo, Auxilium shall cooperate with Endo in good faith
and use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that (i) Endo accedes to
the Convertible Notes Indenture as guarantor or co-obligor to Auxilium
immediately prior to the Merger, effective as of the Merger Effective Time and
(ii) each Auxilium Call Option and Auxilium Warrant issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger is terminated and cancelled as of the Merger
Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Auxilium
Call Option or Auxilium Warrant, as applicable, it being understood that
calculation and settlement of any amounts payable thereunder shall be subject
to Endos prior review and reasonable approval.



   5.10 | Treatment of the Actient Warrants 
---|--- 

Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Auxilium
shall take all actions required to ensure compliance with the obligations of
Auxilium under the Actient Warrants in accordance with the terms thereof,
including the giving of any notice required thereunder. Upon the
reasonable request of Endo, Auxilium shall cooperate with Endo in good faith
with respect to any communications with the holder of the Actient Warrants and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Actient Warrants
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall no longer be
exercisable for Auxilium Shares and shall instead be exercisable solely for
the Warrant Merger Consideration, including by exercising any applicable
elections under the Actient Warrant.

 



   5.11 | Employee Matters 
---|--- 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Merger Effective Time,
Endo shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to all
individuals who are employees of Auxilium and each Auxilium Subsidiary at the
Merger Effective Time (the "Assumed Employees") with (i) base salary or
hourly wage (as applicable) no less favorable than the base salary and hourly
wage (as applicable) to those in effect immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, (ii) commission, cash annual bonus, equity-based and other
long-term incentive compensation opportunities (as applicable) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to those of similarly situated employees of
Endo or its Subsidiaries, (iii) terms and conditions of employment (other than
those benefits covered by (i) and (ii)) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to those of similarly situated employees of Endo or its
Subsidiaries, (iv) vacation and other paid time off policies that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to those of similarly situated employees of Endo
or its Subsidiaries, and (v) subject to the other terms of this Section 5.11,
employee benefits (other than those benefits covered by (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv)), that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those of similarly
situated employees of Endo or its Subsidiaries.

 



-77- (b) Following the Merger Effective Time, each Assumed Employee shall receive
service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but
not for benefit accrual purposes) for employment, compensation, and employee
benefit plan purposes with Auxilium or any Auxilium Subsidiary prior to the
Merger Effective Time. Each Assumed Employee shall also receive service
credit for purposes of calculating the level of benefits with respect to
severance, vacation, and other paid time off, and any other welfare-type
benefits where length of service is a factor in calculating benefits. Endo
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Assumed Employees with
full credit under Endos health and welfare plans applicable to each Assumed
Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the
Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer. Subject to the approval of any insurance carrier or third
party provider, Endo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions exclusions (or actively at work or
similar limitations), evidence of insurability requirements and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Assumed Employees and their eligible dependents under any health and
welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Closing Date.

 

(c) To the extent not yet paid, Endo shall pay, or cause the Surviving Company
to pay, to all Assumed Employees any commissions due under the applicable
Auxilium commission plans but not yet paid prior to the Closing Date. Except
as otherwise provided on Section 5.11(c) of the Auxilium Disclosure Letter,
such commissions shall be paid at target level, in an aggregate amount not
to exceed the amount accrued for such commissions on the Auxilium Financial
Statements or that would have been accrued (based on the accounting policies
and methodology utilized by Auxilium and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date) as of immediately prior to the payment thereof.

(d) Auxilium intends to pay bonuses and other incentive compensation
attributable to the 2014 calendar year (other than commissions as set forth
in Section 5.11(c)) at target level not later than December 31, 2014. However,
if any bonus or other incentive compensation attributable to the 2014 calendar
year (other than commissions as set forth in Section 5.11(c)) is not paid to
any Assumed Employee prior to the Closing Date, Endo shall pay, or cause the
Surviving Company or the applicable Subsidiary thereof to pay, such bonus or
other incentive compensation (other than commissions as set forth in Section
5.11(c)) to such Assumed Employee at target level, in an aggregate amount not
to exceed the amount accrued for such bonuses on the Auxilium Financial
Statements or that would have been accrued (based on the accounting policies
and methodology utilized by Auxilium and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date) as of immediately prior to the payment thereof, which payment shall
occur not later than March 15, 2015, regardless of whether the
Assumed Employee is employed by the Surviving Company as of the payment date.

 



-78- (e) Endo shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain the Auxilium
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Severance Plan ("Auxilium Severance Plan") for the
benefit of the Assumed Employees for at least twelve (12) months following the
Merger Effective Time. In the event that an Assumed Employees employment is
terminated after the Merger Effective Time, the Assumed Employee shall be
entitled to the severance benefits under the Auxilium Severance Plan or
pursuant to the Endo severance guidelines, whichever provides the greatest
severance benefits to the Assumed Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Endo shall, in its discretion, be permitted to pay, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to pay, any such severance benefits due to an Assumed
Employee under this Section 5.11(e) in a manner administratively consistent
with its payment of benefits pursuant to the Endo severance guidelines, so
long as doing so does not materially and adversely affect any such Assumed
Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Assumed Employee terminated on
the Closing Date shall only be entitled to receive severance benefits under
the Auxilium Severance Plan and shall not be eligible for severance benefits
pursuant to the Endo severance guidelines.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, no provision of this
Agreement (including this Section 5.11) shall operate to (i) duplicate any
benefit provided to any Assumed Employee, (ii) be construed as in any way
modifying or amending the provisions of any Auxilium Plan or any employee
benefit plan of Endo, (iii) subject to the express terms of this Section
5.11, require Endo to continue any Auxilium Plan or limit Endo from
terminating or modifying any employee benefit plan that Endo may establish or
maintain, (iv) confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns or (v) create
any agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third
party beneficiary hereto. Endo and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Company, reserve the right to terminate any Assumed Employee, subject to
compliance with the terms set forth in this Section 5.11.



   5.12 | Insurance 
---|--- 

From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Auxilium shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure that any renewal of the current
insurance policies and contracts of Auxilium and its Subsidiaries in effect on
the date hereof shall permit cancellation thereof at any time without penalty,
including by requesting its insurers to include such a provision in any such
renewed policies and contracts. At Endos request, Auxilium shall reasonably
cooperate with Endo in good faith and take such actions as Endo may reasonably
request to purchase, at Endos cost and expense and effective as of the
Closing, "tail" insurance coverage to the product liabilities insurance of
Auxilium and its Subsidiaries, for the period specified by Endo and on such
other terms and conditions as Endo may direct. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the binding or otherwise obtaining of any
such "tail" insurance coverage shall not be a condition to Closing.

 



-79- ARTICLE 6

 

 _ACQUISITION PROPOSALS_



   6.1 | Auxilium Non-Solicitation 
---|--- 

(a) Subject to Section 6.2, until the earlier of the Closing or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, Auxilium
shall not, and Auxilium shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct each of its
and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through
any other Person:

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including
by way of furnishing or affording access to information), or take any other
action that is reasonably expected to promote, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Auxilium
Acquisition Proposal or potential Auxilium Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
provide any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or assist or participate in, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly
facilitate, any effort or attempt by any other Person (other than Endo and its
Affiliates) to make or complete an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) effect any Auxilium Change of Recommendation; or

 

(iv) accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any
Auxilium Acquisition Agreement.

 

(b) Auxilium shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately upon execution of this Agreement
cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion
or negotiation with or involving any Person (other than Endo and its
Affiliates) conducted heretofore by Auxilium or its Subsidiaries, or any of
its or their respective Representatives, with respect to any Auxilium
Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Auxilium Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith, Auxilium will
immediately discontinue access by any Person (other than Endo and its
Affiliates) to any data room (virtual or otherwise) established by Auxilium or
its Representatives for such purpose. Except to the extent that the Auxilium
Board of Directors determines, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to release the relevant third party would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Auxilium
Board of Directors under applicable Law, Auxilium agrees not to release any
third party (other than Endo and its Affiliates) from any "standstill"
agreement to which it is a party (it being acknowledged and agreed that the
automatic termination of any "standstill" or similar provision of any
agreement as the result of the entering into and announcement of this
Agreement pursuant to the express terms of any such agreement shall not itself
be a violation of this Section 6.1(b)). Within ten (10) Business Days from the
date hereof, Auxilium shall request the return or destruction of all
confidential non-public information provided to any third parties who have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with Auxilium since September 1, 2013

 



-80-  relating to any potential Auxilium Acquisition Proposal and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honored in
accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreements.

(c) Auxilium shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt)
notify Endo, at first orally and then in writing, of any proposal, inquiry,
offer or request relating to or constituting an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal,
or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Auxilium Acquisition
Proposal, in each case, received on or after the date hereof, of
which Auxilium, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives is or becomes aware, or any request received by Auxilium or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives for non-
public information relating to Auxilium or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with a potential or actual Auxilium Acquisition Proposal or for
access to the properties, books and records or a list of securityholders of
Auxilium or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with a potential or actual
Auxilium Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall include the identity of the
Person making such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer
or request and a description of the material terms and conditions of
such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or request,
including a copy of any written materials submitted to Auxilium, any of its
Subsidiaries or their Representatives. Following the initial notification by
Auxilium to Endo in respect of any Auxilium Acquisition Proposal (or
proposal, inquiry, offer or request in respect thereof) pursuant to the terms
of the immediately preceding sentence, Auxilium will keep Endo promptly and
fully informed of the status, including any change to the material terms and
conditions, of any such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal, proposal, inquiry,
offer or request (for the avoidance of doubt, following such initial
notification pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the terms
of this sentence shall control in respect of such Auxilium Acquisition
Proposal, proposal, inquiry, offer or request).

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, following receipt by Auxilium of any proposal, inquiry, offer
or request (or any amendment thereto) that is not an Auxilium Acquisition
Proposal but which Auxilium reasonably believes could lead to an Auxilium
Acquisition Proposal, Auxilium may respond to the proponent to advise it that
Auxilium can only enter into discussions or negotiations with a party in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if after the date hereof and before the receipt of the Auxilium
Stockholder Approval, Auxilium or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or
their respective Representatives, receives a written Auxilium Acquisition
Proposal (including, an amendment, change or modification to an
Auxilium Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date hereof) that was not
solicited after the date hereof in contravention of this Section 6.1, Auxilium
and its Representatives may:

 

(i) contact the Person making such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives solely for the purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions
of such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal and the likelihood of its consummation,
so as to determine whether such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal is, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Auxilium Superior Proposal; and

 



-81- (ii) if the Auxilium Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Auxilium Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Auxilium Superior Proposal:

 

(A) furnish information with respect to Auxilium and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives;
_provided_ that (I) Auxilium first enters into a confidentiality agreement
with such Person that is no less favorable (including with respect to any
"standstill" and similar provisions) to Auxilium than the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, and sends a copy of such agreement to Endo promptly following its
execution and (II) Auxilium contemporaneously provides to Endo any non-public
information concerning Auxilium and its Subsidiaries that is provided to
such Person which was not previously provided to Auxilium or its
Representatives; and

(B) engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to an Auxilium
Acquisition Proposal with the Person making such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal
and its Representatives.



   6.2 | Auxilium Change of Recommendation; Endo Right to Match 
---|--- 

(a) Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a) or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the Auxilium Board of Directors may, at any time after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Auxilium Stockholder
Approval, (1) effect an Auxilium Change of Recommendation due to the
occurrence of an Auxilium Intervening Event, or (2) following receipt of a
bona fide, unsolicited, written Auxilium Acquisition Proposal that the
Auxilium Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
Auxiliums outside legal and financial advisors, is an Auxilium Superior
Proposal, (A) effect an Auxilium Change of Recommendation, and/or (B) accept,
approve or enter into any Auxilium Acquisition Agreement, in each case with
respect to clauses (1) and (2), if and only if:

(i) with respect to Section 6.2(a)(2) above, such Auxilium Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 6.1 and Auxilium has complied
with the other terms of this Section 6.2;

 

(ii) the Auxilium Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
failure to take the action specified in Section 6.2(a)(1) or Section
6.2(a)(2), as applicable, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Auxilium Stockholders under applicable Laws;

 

(iii) Auxilium has (A) delivered an Auxilium Change of Recommendation Notice
to Endo and (B) in the case of Section 6.2(a)(2), provided Endo with a copy
of the document(s) containing such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal;

(iv) a period of at least five full Business Days (such five (5) Business Day
period, the "Right to Match Period") shall have elapsed from (A) in the case
of an Auxilium Change of Recommendation Notice delivered pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(1), the date on which Endo received such Auxilium Change of
Recommendation Notice and (B) in the case of an

 



-82-  Auxilium Change of Recommendation Notice delivered pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(2), the later of the date on which Endo received such Auxilium Change
of Recommendation Notice and the date on which Endo received a copy of the
documents referred to in Section 6.2(a)(iii)(B), it being understood that the
Right to Match Period shall expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) at the
end of the fifth (5th) full Business Day following the date or later date, as
applicable, specified in the immediately preceding clauses (A) or (B), as
applicable; _provided_ that the Right to Match Period shall be subject to
Section 6.2(d);

 

(v) if Endo has offered to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger
during the Right to Match Period pursuant to Section 6.2(b), the Auxilium
Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that (A) in the case of an
Auxilium Change of Recommendation Notice delivered pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(1), in view of the Auxilium Intervening Event when assessed against
this Agreement and the Merger as they are proposed to be amended as at the
termination of the Right to Match Period and, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the failure to take the action specified in Section
6.2(a)(1) would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Auxilium Board of Directors under applicable Laws and (B) in the
case of an Auxilium Change of Recommendation Notice delivered pursuant to
Section 6.2(a)(2), the Auxilium Acquisition Proposal described therein
continues to be an Auxilium Superior Proposal when assessed against this
Agreement and the Merger as they are proposed to be amended as at the
termination of the Right to Match Period and, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the action specified in
Section 6.2(a)(2) would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Auxilium Board of Directors under applicable Laws; and

(vi) solely in the case of the taking of the actions referred to in Section
6.2(a)(2), Auxilium has previously or concurrently will have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(i).

 

(b) During the Right to Match Period, Endo will have the opportunity, but not
the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger.
Auxilium agrees that, if requested by Endo, it will negotiate with Endo in
good faith to make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger as would enable Auxilium to not take the actions referred to
in Section 6.2(a) and to therefore proceed with the transactions contemplated
hereby on such amended terms. The Auxilium Board of Directors will review in
good faith any such offer made by Endo to amend the terms of this Agreement
and the Merger in order to determine, in consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, whether such offer to amend the terms of
this Agreement and the Merger would, if accepted, (i) obviate the need to
effect an Auxilium Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(1), or
(ii) result in the applicable Auxilium Acquisition Proposal ceasing to be an
Auxilium Superior Proposal when assessed against this Agreement and the Merger
as they are proposed to be amended as at the termination of the Right to
Match Period. If the Auxilium Board of Directors so determines, Auxilium will
forthwith so advise Endo and will promptly thereafter accept the offer by Endo
to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger, and the Parties agree to
take such actions and execute such documents as are necessary to give effect
to the foregoing. If the Auxilium Board of Directors continues to believe, in
good faith and after consultation with financial 

 



-83-  advisors and outside legal counsel, that (A) it is required to effect an
Auxilium Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(1) or (B) such
Auxilium Acquisition Proposal remains an Auxilium Superior Proposal and, in
each case, therefore rejects Endos amended proposal, Auxilium may take the
actions referred to in Section 6.1(a), subject to compliance with the terms
set forth in this Section 6.2, as applicable, and Section 7.1(c)(i).

(c) The Auxilium Board of Directors shall reaffirm the Auxilium Recommendation
by news release as soon as reasonably practicable after (i) the Auxilium
Board of Directors determines that an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal which has
been publicly announced or made is not an Auxilium Superior Proposal; or (ii)
the Auxilium Board of Directors determines that an Auxilium Acquisition
Proposal which previously constituted an Auxilium Superior Proposal would
cease to be an Auxilium Superior Proposal when assessed against this Agreement
and the Merger as they are proposed to be amended as at the termination of
the Right to Match Period. Endo shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the form and content of any such news release. Such news
release shall state that the Auxilium Board of Directors has determined that
the applicable Auxilium Acquisition Proposal is not an Auxilium Superior
Proposal.

(d) Each successive amendment, change or modification to any Auxilium
Acquisition Proposal that results in an increase in, or modification of, the
consideration (or value of such consideration) to be received by the Auxilium
Stockholders or other amendment, change or modification to any other material
terms and conditions thereof shall constitute a new Auxilium Acquisition
Proposal for the purposes of this Section 6.2 and shall require the delivery
of a new Auxilium Change of Recommendation Notice and result in
the commencement of a new Right to Match Period from the date specified in
Section 6.2(a)(iv) with respect to such new Auxilium Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that each such new Right to Match Period will be three (3) Business
Days in length.

(e) If Auxilium provides Endo with an Auxilium Change of Recommendation Notice
on a date that is less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Auxilium
Meeting, Auxilium shall adjourn the Auxilium Meeting to a date that is not
later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the first day of the Right
to Match Period.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit Auxilium or the Auxilium Board of Directors from: 

(i) (A) disclosing to the Auxilium Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (B) making any
disclosure to the Auxilium Stockholders, if the Auxilium Board of Directors
has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with Auxiliums
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Auxilium Stockholders
under applicable Law; _provided_ that this Section 6.2(f)(i) shall not permit
the Auxilium Board of Directors to make a Auxilium Change of
Recommendation, except to the extent permitted by this Section 6.2 (other
than Section 6.2(f)(i)); or

 



-84- (ii) calling and/or holding a meeting of the Auxilium Stockholders
requisitioned by the Auxilium Stockholders in accordance with the DGCL or
taking any other action with respect to an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal to
the extent ordered or otherwise mandated by a court of competent jurisdiction
in accordance with applicable Laws; _provided_  that, subject to the other
terms set forth in this Section 6.2, any proxy statement or other document
required in connection with such meeting recommends that the Auxilium
Stockholders vote against any proposed resolution in favor of or necessary to
complete such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal.

(g) Auxilium shall ensure that each of its Subsidiaries, and each of its
and their respective Representatives, is aware of the provisions of Section
6.1 and this Section 6.2 and Auxilium shall be responsible for any breach of
Section 6.1 or this Section 6.2 by such Persons.

not been satisfied or waived, Endo or Auxilium may by written notice to the
other Parties extend the Outside Date to July 8, 2015; _provided_ , _however_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i)
shall not be available to a Party if the failure of that Party or
its Affiliate to fulfill any of its obligations or breach of any of its
agreements or covenants under this Agreement has been a principal cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date;

 

(ii) if the Auxilium Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Auxilium
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; or

 

(iii) there shall be passed any Law that makes consummation of the

prohibited or if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued an Order or taken any other action enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger, and such Order or other action is or shall have become
final and non-appealable.

 



-85- (c) This Agreement may be terminated by Auxilium at any time prior to the

to concurrently enter into an Auxilium Acquisition Agreement that constitutes
an Auxilium Superior Proposal;

(ii) Endo breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or

earlier of (A) thirty (30) days following the delivery of written notice to
Endo from Auxilium of such breach and (B) three (3) Business Days prior to the

period referred to in the immediately preceding clause (A) shall be three (3)
Business Days and not thirty (30) days as referred to therein;

(iii) Endo shall have failed to confirm in writing, on or prior to the
earlier of (A) twenty (20) Business Days following receipt of a written
request therefor from Auxilium and (B) three (3) Business Days prior to the

to Section 7.1(d)(iv); or

(i) Auxilium shall have effected an Auxilium Change of Recommendation;

Section 6.2;

 

(iii) Auxilium breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or

(or by its nature or timing cannot be cured by) the earlier of (A)
thirty (30) days following the delivery of written notice to Auxilium from
Endo of such breach and (B) three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date;

Business Days and not thirty (30) days as referred to therein;

 

(iv) subject to Endo paying the Endo Termination Fee to Auxilium in accordance
with Section 7.2, there shall have occurred, after the date of this Agreement
but on or before the Closing Date, a change in applicable U.S. federal Tax Law
(whether or not such change in Law is yet effective), or official
interpretation thereof as set forth in published guidance by the U.S.
Treasury Department or the IRS (other than News Releases) (whether or not
such change in official interpretation is yet effective), or the passing of a
bill that would implement such a change by the United States House of
Representatives and the United States Senate and for which the time period
for the President of the United States to sign or veto such

 



-86-  bills has not yet elapsed, in any such case, that, as a result of
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement once effective,
in the opinion of nationally recognized U.S. tax counsel, would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Endo pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect" (without regard to the exclusion in clause (f) of
the definition of "Material Adverse Effect"); or

(v) a Material Adverse Effect on Auxilium shall have occurred since the date
of this Agreement.

 



   7.2 | Termination Fee 
---|--- 

(a) If an Auxilium Termination Fee Event occurs, Auxilium shall pay to Endo a
termination fee of $70,000,000 (the "Auxilium Termination Fee") by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by Endo. If an
Endo Termination Fee Event occurs, Endo shall pay to Auxilium a termination
fee of $150,000,000 (the "Endo Termination Fee") by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account specified by Auxilium. The Auxilium
Termination Fee shall be payable at the time specified in Section 7.2(b). The
Endo Termination Fee shall be payable at the time specified in Section 7.2(c).

(b) "Auxilium Termination Fee Event" means:

(i) the termination of this Agreement by Auxilium pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(i), in which case the Auxilium Termination Fee shall be paid by
Auxilium concurrent with the Auxilium Termination Fee Event;

(ii) the termination of this Agreement by Endo pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i),
in which case the Auxilium Termination Fee shall be paid by Auxilium within
two (2) Business Days of the Auxilium Termination Fee Event; or

 

(iii) the termination of this Agreement by either Endo or Auxilium pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(ii) or by Endo pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii), if, in any of the foregoing cases, (x) prior to such termination,
an Auxilium Acquisition Proposal shall have been made public or proposed
publicly to Auxilium or Auxilium Stockholders and has not been publicly
withdrawn prior to the Auxilium Meeting and (y) within twelve (12) months
following such termination, Auxilium or one or more of Auxiliums Subsidiaries
shall have executed an Auxilium Acquisition Agreement and the transactions
thereby are subsequently consummated or consummated any transaction in respect
of such Auxilium Acquisition Proposal, in which cases the Auxilium Termination
Fee shall be paid by Auxilium on the date of consummation of such
transaction;  _provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 7.2(b)(iii), the

term in Section 1.1, except that all references to "20%" therein shall
be deemed to be references to "50%."

(c) "Endo Termination Fee Event" means the termination of this Agreement
by Endo pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iv) or by Auxilium pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(iii), in which case the Endo Termination Fee shall be paid by Endo
concurrent with the Endo Termination Fee Event (in the case of termination by
Endo) or within two (2) Business Days of the Auxilium Termination Fee Event
(in the case of termination by Auxilium).

 



-87- (d) Each Party acknowledges that the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 7.2 represents a payment of liquidated damages which are a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages which Endo or Auxilium, as applicable,
will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and
are not penalties. Auxilium and Endo irrevocably waive any right that it may
have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. The Parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 7.2 in the manner provided herein is the sole and exclusive
remedy of Endo or Auxilium, as applicable, in respect of the event giving rise
to such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this
Section 7.2, and no payment of the Termination Fee, shall relieve or have the
effect of relieving a Party in any way from liability for damages incurred or
suffered by the other Party as a result of an intentional or willful breach of
this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in no event shall
either Party be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once.

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(i), Section 7.1(d)(i), Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii) (due
to a breach by Auxilium of any covenants or agreements thereof that are set
forth herein), Auxilium shall within two (2) Business Days of such termination
pay by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified
by Endo an amount equal to the QLT Termination Fee (in addition to any
Auxilium Termination Fee payable upon such termination).

 



   7.3 | Effect of Termination 
---|--- 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Article 7
(other than pursuant to Section 7.1(a)) shall deliver written notice of such
termination to each other Party. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
and in accordance with this Article 7 (including payment of the Termination
Fee and the QLT Termination Fee, if applicable), it will become void and of
no further force and effect, with no liability on the part of any Party to any
other Party, except that (a) nothing shall relieve any Party of any liability
or obligations arising from any intentional or willful breach by any Party of
any of its covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and (b) the
terms set forth in last paragraph of Section 5.1(b), Section 7.2, this Section
7.3 and Article 9 (and any related definitions contained in any such Sections
or Article), as well as the Non-Disclosure Agreement, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

and be binding upon each Party hereto.



   9.5 | Public Announcements

following the execution of this Agreement, the text and timing of each Partys

obligation to obtain the consent of or consult with the other Party prior to

-93- ---|--- 

(a) This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
of any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties (i)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Chancery Court") or, if, but only if,
the Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court
located in the State of Delaware with respect to any dispute arising out
of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of,
relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, in any court other than any such court. The
parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the Chancery Court or, if, but only if,
the Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

(b) Each Party hereby agrees that any service of process, summons, notice or
document by registered mail addressed to such Person at its address set forth
in Section 9.1 shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or
proceeding relating to any dispute arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR OTHER
PROCEEDING AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE, INCLUDING
THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS, EACH OF WHICH IS HEREBY
INTENDED TO BE AN EXPRESS THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THIS SECTION 9.6(C),
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTER).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.6 to the contrary, and without
limiting anything set forth in Section 9.14, each of the Parties agrees that
it will not bring or support (and it will not support any of its Affiliates to
bring or support) any claim, suit, action or other proceeding (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against or involving any
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any related financing),
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New
York State court or federal court sitting in the County of New York and the
Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof). The Parties further agree
that all of 

 



-94-  the provisions of this Section 9.6 relating to waiver of jury trial shall
apply to any suit, action or other proceeding referenced in this Section
9.6(d), including any such Financing Sources respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third
party beneficiary of this Section 9.6(d).



   9.7 | Entire Agreement 
---|--- 

This Agreement, together with the Non-Disclosure Agreement, and any documents
delivered hereunder, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties, with respect to the subject matter thereof.

 



   9.8 | Third Party Beneficiaries 
---|--- 

Except as provided in Sections 5.1, 5.5 and as provided for the Financing
Sources pursuant to this Section 9.8, Sections 9.6(a), 9.6(c), 9.6(d), 9.9 and
9.14 (who are intended third party beneficiaries thereunder and are intended
to be the only third party beneficiaries thereunder), this Agreement
shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



   9.9 | Amendment 
---|--- 

This Agreement may, at any time and from time to time but not later than
the Closing, be amended by written agreement of the Parties hereto without,
subject to applicable Laws, further notice to or authorization on the part of
the Auxilium Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of
Sections 9.6(a), 9.6(c), 9.6(d), 9.8, 9.9 and 9.14 shall not be amended,
modified or waived (with respect to the rights of the Financing Sources)
without the respective Financing Sources prior written consent.

 



   9.10 | Waiver and Modifications 
---|--- 

Any Party may (a) waive, in whole or in part, any inaccuracy of, or consent
to the modification of, any representation or warranty made to it hereunder or
in any document to be delivered pursuant hereto, (b) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Parties, (c) waive
or consent to the modification of any of the covenants herein contained for
its benefit or waive or consent to the modification of any of the obligations
of the other Parties hereto or (d) waive the fulfillment of any condition to
its own obligations contained herein. No waiver or consent to the
modifications of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be effective or
binding unless made in writing and signed by the Party or Parties purporting
to give the same and, unless otherwise provided, will be limited to the
specific breach or condition waived. The rights and remedies of the Parties
hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights and remedies available at Law or in equity or otherwise. No
single or partial exercise by a Party of any right or remedy precludes or
otherwise affects any further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise
of any other right or remedy to which that Party may be entitled. No waiver
or partial waiver of any nature, in any one or more instances, will be deemed
or construed a continued waiver of any condition or breach of any other term,
representation or warranty in this Agreement.

 



-95- ---|--- 

Upon such determination that any provision is illegal, invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



   9.12 | Further Assurances 
---|--- 

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, from time to
time, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all such further
documents and instruments, as the other Parties may, either before or after
the Closing, reasonably require to effectively carry out or perfect the full
intent and meaning of this Agreement.



   9.13 | Injunctive Relief 
---|--- 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law or otherwise.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and this right shall include the right of the parties to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated on the terms set
forth in this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity or pursuant to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the
defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate.

(b) Notwithstanding the parties rights to specific performance or injunctive
relief or both pursuant to Section 9.13(a), each party may pursue any other
remedy available to it at Law or in equity, including monetary damages;
_provided_ that it is understood and agreed that claims for monetary damages
following termination of this Agreement shall be limited to those arising
from or relating to any intentional or willful breach of this Agreement prior
to such termination.



   9.14 | No Recourse 
---|--- 

Without limiting any other provision in this Agreement, this Agreement may be
enforced only against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement, may be made only against the Parties hereto,
and no Financing Source shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the Parties hereto or for any claim (whether in tort, contract
or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith. In no

 



-96-  event shall Auxilium or any of its Affiliates, and Auxilium agrees not to
and to cause its Affiliates not to, (a) seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Financing Source or (b) seek to enforce the
commitments against, make any claims for breach of the Financing Commitment
Letter commitments against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or
otherwise sue, the Financing Sources for any reason, including in connection
with the Financing Commitment Letter commitments or the obligations of
Financing Sources thereunder. Nothing in this Section 9.14 shall in any
way limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the
Financing Commitment Letter to each other or in connection therewith.



   9.15 | Counterparts 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any number of
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic transmission), each of
which will be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together will be
deemed to constitute one and the same instrument, and each Party may enter
into this Agreement by executing a counterpart and delivering it to the other
Party (by personal delivery, facsimile, electronic transmission or otherwise).



   9.16 | Endo Guarantee 
---|--- 

Endo hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Auxilium the due
and punctual payment and performance by each other Endo Party of all of such
other Endo Partys covenants, obligations and agreements set forth in this
Agreement. Endo acknowledges and agrees that the guarantee being granted by it
pursuant to the terms hereof constitutes a guaranty of performance and of
payment when due of all of the covenants, obligations and agreements of the
other Endo Parties set forth in this Agreement and not just of collection, and
waives any right to require that any resort be had by Auxilium to enforce any
of such covenants, obligations or agreements against any other Endo Party.
Without limiting the foregoing, Endo shall cause the other Endo Parties to
perform all of their covenants, obligations and agreements set forth in this
Agreement.
