                                                     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of March 25, 2005, by and among Acxiom
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Adam Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Purchaser"), and Digital Impact, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                                                               RECITALS

         A.    It is proposed that Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable, commence a tender offer to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

         B.    It is also proposed that, following the consummation of the Offer (as defined in Section 1.1(a)), Purchaser will
merge with and into the Company and each Company Share (as defined in Section 2.6(a)) that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to
the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price (as
defined in Section 1.1(a)), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

         C.    As a condition and further inducement to Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations
set forth herein, certain stockholders of the Company (each, a "Stockholder") concurrently herewith are entering into a Stockholder
Agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, with Parent and Purchaser, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A, pursuant to which each such Stockholder has, among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, irrevocably agreed to tender such shares of Company Common Stock.

         D.    Each of the Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser, and Company, has (i)determined that this Agreement is
advisable, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), taken
together, are in the best interests of their respective stockholders, and (iii) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.


         E.    As a condition and further inducement to Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and incur the
obligations set forth herein, certain individuals have entered into employment agreements (the "Employment Agreements") with Parent
in the form attached hereto as Exhibits B-1 through B-3.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:


                                                               ARTICLE I
                                                               THE OFFER
        1.1      The Offer.
                (a)      Terms of the Offer; Conditions to Offer.  Provided that this Agreement shall not have been earlier
terminated in accordance with Article VIII, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than five (5)
business days after the public announcement of this Agreement), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) a tender offer
(the "Offer") to purchase all of the Company Shares (as defined in Section 2.6(a)) at a price per Company Share, subject to the
terms of Section 1.1(b), equal to a price of Three Dollars and Fifty Cents ($3.50) per Company Share, net to the holder thereof in
cash (such amount, or any different amount per Company Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, is the "Offer Price").  The
obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and the obligation of Parent to
cause Purchaser to accept for payment any Company Shares tendered) shall be subject only to (i) the condition (the "Minimum
Condition") that, prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time pursuant to Section
1.1(c)) there be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Company Shares that,
together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent and Purchaser (if any), represents 50.1% of all then outstanding Company
Shares calculated on a fully diluted basis (including, without limitation, all Company Shares issuable upon the conversion of any


                                                                        -2-

convertible securities or uponthe exercise of any options, warrants or rights, excluding, however, any securities not convertible or
exercisable on or prior to August 31, 2005(including for this purpose any securities which become convertible or exercisable on or
prior to August 31, 2005 as a result of conversion pursuant to Section 2.6(e)) shall have been validly tendered in accordance with
the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement of each of the other conditions set forth in Annex A.  Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right
to waive any such condition, to increase the Offer Price, and to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
provided, however, that unless previously approved by the Company in writing, neither Parent nor Purchaser may make any change to
the terms and conditions of the Offer that (i) decreases the Offer Price, (ii) changes the form of consideration to be paid in the
Offer, (iii) reduces the number of Company Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to
the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A, (v) amends the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A so as to broaden the
scope of such conditions to the Offer,(vi) extends the Offer except as provided in Section 1.1(c), (vii) amends or waives the
Minimum Condition, or (viii) makes any other change to any of the terms and conditions of the Offer that is adverse to the holders
of Company Shares in the reasonable and good faith judgment of the Company.  The conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A are
for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time, in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Purchaser only with the
prior written consent of the Company.  The failure by Parent and Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.

           (b)      Adjustments to Offer Price.  The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Purchaser's acceptance for
payment of, and payment for, Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

                                                                        -3-

         (c)      Extension and Expiration of Offer.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at midnight, New York Time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days (calculated in accordance with
Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act); provided, however, that (i) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or its staff, or of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
("Nasdaq"), that is applicable to the Offer, and (ii) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer set forth on Annex A are
not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for successive
extension periods of not more than ten (10) business days each, until such time as either (A) all of the conditions to the Offer
are satisfied or waived, or (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms of Article VIII; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 1.1(c), in no event shall (x) Purchaser be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Initial Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date, as applicable or (y) Purchaser be required to
extend the Offer beyond the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII.

         (d)      Payment for Company Shares.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with Section 1.1(c)).  The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable withholding in
accordance with Section 2.7(d).

         (e)      Subsequent Offering Period.  Purchaser may (but shall not be required to), only with the prior written consent of
the Company, extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) of not
less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business days immediately following the expiration of the Offer.  Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and
pay for,all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as so extended by such subsequent offering
period, as promptly as practicable after any such Company Shares are tendered during such subsequent offering period.  The Offer

                                                                        -4-

Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as so extended by such
subsequent offering period, shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable
withholding in accordance with Section 2.7(d).

        (f)      Transfers of Ownership. If the payment equal to the Offer Price or Merger Consideration in cash is to be made to a
Person (as defined in Section 9.3(f)) other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall
be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Offer Price or Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable.

         (g)      Schedule TO; Offer Documents.  On the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which shall
contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference an Offer to Purchase, or portions thereof (the "Offer to Purchase"), and forms of
the letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, in respect of the Offer (together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of Company Shares

positions, to the extent available), and with such assistance, as Parent or its agents may reasonably request in order to
disseminate and otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Company Shares.  Such information shall be
provided in such format, including electronic form (if such information is existing in electronic form), as may be reasonably
requested by Parent and as is practicable.  Subject to any and all Legal Requirements, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Purchaser and their agents
shall (i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and listings or files of

                                                                        -8-

securities positions, (ii)use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, (iii) if (A) this Agreement
shall be terminated pursuant to Article VIII and (B) Parent and Purchaser shall withdraw the Offer or the Offer shall otherwise
expire or terminate in accordance with the terms hereof without Purchaser (or Parent on Purchaser's behalf) having accepted for
payment any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, deliver (and shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause their agents
to deliver) to the Company any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or
control.

        1.3      Company Boards of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange Act.

                (a)      Composition of Company Board.  Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Purchaser of the Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer (the "Appointment Time"), Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of: (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving
effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3); and (ii) the percentage that the number of Company
Shares owned by Parent and/or Purchaser (including Company Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Company Shares
outstanding. Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause Parent's
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including, without limitation, at the option of Parent, increasing the
number of directors (and amending the Bylaws if so required), or seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors, or both;
provided, however, that prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2), the Company Board shall always have at least two
members who were directors of the Company prior to consummation of the Offer and who are not affiliated with Parent or Purchaser
(each, a "Continuing Director").  In the event that a Continuing Director shall resign from the Company Board prior to the Effective
Time, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall permit the remaining Continuing Directors to appoint the resigning director's
successor, who shall thereafter be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of and under this Agreement. If the number
of Continuing Directors is reduced to fewer than two for any reason prior to the Effective Time, the remaining and departing
Continuing Directors shall be entitled to designate a person to fill the vacancy or vacancies such that there shall be at least two
Continuing Directors, who shall thereafter be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of and under this Agreement.  If

                                                                        -9-

there shall be no Continuing Directors prior to the Effective Time, the majority of the members of the Company Board who are not
Continuing Directors shall designate two persons to fill the vacancies such that there shall be two Continuing Directors, who shall
thereafter be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of and under this Agreement.  The Company shall, upon Parent's
request following the Appointment Time, also cause persons elected or designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board (other than as it
relates to action which may be taken or is required to be taken by the Continuing Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(c), (ii) each
board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in
each case only to the extent permitted by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Company Shares are listed.

           (b)      Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act.  The Company's obligation to appoint Parent's designees to the Company Board
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.  The Company shall promptly take all
action required pursuant to this Section 1.3 and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.3, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers as
is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3.  Parent shall
provide to the Company in writing, and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, directors,
officers and affiliates, required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

         (c)      Required Approvals of Continuing Directors.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
after the Appointment Time but prior to the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors shall be
required in order to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement,
in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of
Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the Company's rights, benefits or privileges under this Agreement if
such action would adversely affect the interests of the Company Securityholders (other than Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)), or (iv) make any other determination with respect to any action to be taken or not
to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer

                                                                        -10-

and the Merger, if such action would adversely affect the interests of the Company Securityholders (other than Parent, Purchaser and
their affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)); or (v) approve any other action by the Company which is reasonably
likely to materially and adversely affect the interests of the Company Securityholders (other than Parent, Purchaser and their
affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limitation, any decrease in the amount of Merger Consideration or any change in the form of Merger Consideration shall be deemed to
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Company Securityholders (other than Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)).

                                                              ARTICLE II

                                                              THE MERGER

        2.1      The Merger.  At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation.  The Company,
as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."

        2.2      Effective Time; Closing.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger (or a Certificate of Ownership and Merger, as applicable) in customary form with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of
Merger") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on
or after the Closing Date (as defined below).  The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at  a location, time and
date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second (2nd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are not capable of being satisfied or
waived until the Closing), or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

                                                                        -11-

        2.3      Effect of the Merger.  At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

        2.4      Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.  At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such
Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Digital
Impact, Inc." and the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended so as to comply with Section 6.11(a).  At the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the Bylaws of Purchaser, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Bylaws;
provided, however, that at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to comply with
Section  6.11(a).

        2.5      Directors &amp; Officers.  The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.  The initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly appointed.

        2.6      Effect on Capital Stock.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of
the Company, the following shall occur:

                (a)      Company Common Stock.  Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(together with the associated Company Right (as defined in Section 3.2(a)) under the Company Rights Agreement (as defined in

                                                                        -12-

Section 3.2(a)) ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Shares"),
other than (i) any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.6(c) and (ii) the Appraisal Shares (as
defined in Section 2.6(b)), will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Offer Price
in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 2.9).

                (b)      Appraisal Rights.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal
Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Section 262 of DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.6(a), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262.  At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.6(a).  The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Delaware Law received
by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

                                                                        -13-

                (c)      Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock.  Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or
Parent, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

                (d)      Capital Stock of Purchaser.  Each share of common stock, par value $0.001, of Purchaser issued and
outstanding prior immediately to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                (e)      Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans; Restricted Stock.
                        (i)      Each unexercised Company Option outstanding at the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into an option to purchase common stock of Parent, par value $0.01 per share (the "Parent Common Stock") in accordance
with this Section 2.6(e)(i). Each unexercised Company Option so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Company Option shall be exercisable for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the outstanding Company Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock
and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option so
converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.  The "Exchange
Ratio" shall mean the quotient determined by dividing the Offer Price by the Market Price per share of Parent Common Stock.  No
later than five business days after the Closing, Parent shall register the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Company Option converted pursuant to this Section 2.6(e)(i) by filing a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form)
or another appropriate form with the SEC, and Parent shall use commercial best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such

                                                                        -14-

registration statement and maintain the current status of the prospectus with respect thereto for so long as such options remain
outstanding. For purposes of this Section, "Market Price" per share of Parent Common Stock shall be the average closing price per
share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq for the ten trading days selected by Parent and the Company by lot out of the 20 trading
days ending on and including the fifth trading day prior to the Effective Time (the "Random Trading Days"). Parent and the Company
shall select the Random Trading Days at 5:00 p.m. New York time on such fifth trading day.  It is intended that Company Options
assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the
extent Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this
Section shall be applied consistent with such intent.

                        (ii)     Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Purchase Plan shall be terminated.  The rights of
participants in the Company Purchase Plan with respect to any offering period then underway under such Company Purchase Plan shall
be determined by treating the last business day prior to, or if more administratively advisable, the last payroll date of Company
immediately prior to, the termination of the Company Purchase Plan, as the last day of such offering period and by making such other
pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering
period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under such Company Purchase Plan.  Prior to the Effective
Time, Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of such Company Purchase Plan) that are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.6(e)(ii).

                        (iii)    Each share of restricted (i.e. subject to a lapsing right of repurchase or risk of forfeiture)
Company Common Stock granted under the Company's 1998 Stock Plan, 1999 Director Equity Plan, or under certain Protective Covenants
Agreements by and between the Company and each of Noel McMichael and Paul Owen, executed in connection with the acquisition of
Marketleap.com, Inc. (the "Restricted Company Stock"), issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into the right  to receive the Merger Consideration subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the corresponding
Restricted Company Stock award agreement and Company Stock Option Plan pursuant to which such Restricted Company Stock has been
granted. Merger Consideration in respect of Restricted Company Stock shall be payable at such times as Restricted Company Stock
would have become vested pursuant to the applicable vesting schedules contained in the Restricted Company Stock award agreements in

                                                                        -15-

effect as of the date hereof, subject to acceleration as provided in employment or other agreements between the Company and each
holder of Restricted Company Stock or the Company Stock Option Plan under which it was granted.

                (f)      Adjustments to Merger Consideration.  The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

        2.7      Surrender of Certificates.

                (a)      Payment Agent.  Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the payment agent (the "Payment Agent") in the Merger, and shall enter into a
customary agreement with the Payment Agent, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

                (b)      Parent to Provide Cash.   From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment
of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II upon surrender of Certificates (such funds amount being referred to herein
as the "Merger Fund").

                (c)      Payment Procedures.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser shall
cause the Payment Agent to mail (and shall make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record (as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II: (i) a letter of transmittal (in customary form which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Payment Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger

                                                                        -16-

Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II (which instructions shall provide that, at the election of the
surrendering holder, Certificates may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery)
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Payment
Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II.

                (d)      Required Withholding.  Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid and (ii) Parent shall provide, or cause
the Payment Agent to provide, to such Person written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld.

                (e)      No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.7, neither the Payment Agent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                (f)      Investment of Merger Fund.  The Payment Agent shall invest the cash in the Merger Fund as directed by
Parent on a daily basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders
pursuant to this Article II.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Merger Fund,
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid to
Parent.

                                                                        -17-

                (g)      Termination of Merger Fund.  Any portion of the Merger Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates eighteen (18) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 2.7 shall after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to
the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II.

        2.8      No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  From and after the Effective Time, all cash paid upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

        2.9      Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Payment Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, the amount in cash as may be payable therefor pursuant to Section 2.6.

        2.10     Further Action.  At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Purchaser, any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Purchaser, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to
and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

                                                                        -18-

                                                             ARTICLE III

                                             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser, except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in
Section 3.4(a)) filed on or prior to the date hereof and except as disclosed in the disclosure letter supplied by Company to Parent
dated as of the date hereof (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), as follows:

        3.1      Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents; Subsidiaries.

                (a)      Organization; Standing and Power.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
organization duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted,  and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so organized, existing, qualified and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (as defined in Section 9.3(e)).  For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary," when
used with respect to any party, shall mean any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, at least a
majority of the securities or other interests of which by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of
Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly
owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its subsidiaries, or by such party and one or more of its subsidiaries.

                (b)      Charter Documents.  The Company has delivered or made available to Parent: (i) a true and correct copy of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date (collectively, the "Company Charter Documents")
and (ii) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or like organizational documents (collectively, "Subsidiary Charter
Documents"), of each of its Subsidiaries, and each such instrument is in full force and effect.  The Company is not in violation of

                                                                        -19-

any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents and each of its Subsidiaries are not in violation of their respective
Subsidiary Charter Documents,except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                (c)      Subsidiaries.  Exhibit 21.1 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

management or other employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who have or had a significant role in the Company's internal
controls over financial reporting. The certificates of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company
required by Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act with respect to the Company SEC Reports, as applicable, were true and correct as of

Company and to maintain accountability for the Company's consolidated assets; (iii) access to the Company's consolidated assets is
permitted only in accordance with management's authorization; (iv) the reporting of the Company's consolidated assets is compared
with existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately,

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the time such assessment is required.

interests of the Company and the applicable Subsidiaries of the Company in and to such Trade Secrets;

                        (viii)   the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss or impairment
of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' current right to own, use or bring any action for the infringement of, any of any

Secrets embodied therein) has had access to any of the source code for any of such material Software Programs, and there has been
no disclosure of any such source code to any competitor of the Company, and no act has been done or omitted to be done by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries the result of which would be to dedicate to the public domain or entitle any governmental entity
to hold abandoned or dedicated to the public domain any of such Software Programs.

                                                                        -33-

                (e)      The Software Programs owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries materially contribute in each case

as has not or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                        (ii)     Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered and operated in accordance with its terms, with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, HIPAA, the Code and all other applicable Legal Requirements and the terms of all applicable

                        (iii)    To the Knowledge of the Company, no material oral or written representation or commitment with
respect to any material aspect of any Company Benefit Plan has been made to an Employee (or his or her beneficiary or dependent) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by an authorized Employee of the Company that is not materially in accordance with the
written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such Company Benefit Plans.  To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether written or oral, with any
trade union, works council or other Employee representative body or any material number or category of its Employees which would

their respective workforces (or any part of them).

participated in and/or been obligated to contribute to any Company Benefit Plan in which any persons which are not or were not at
the relevant time, Controlled Group Affiliates of the Company and/or their Employees, have participated.  No Company Benefit Plan
is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.

                (d)      Continuation Coverage.  No Company Benefit Plan provides health benefits (whether or not insured), with

Requirements or benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the Employee) other than individual arrangements the amounts of which
are not material.

                                                                        -38-

                (e)      Effect of Transaction.  The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under
any Company Benefit Plan that will or may result in any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of
payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to
any Employee.  There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement with an Employee to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events), would reasonably be expected to give rise to
the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.

stoppage against Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened which may materially
interfere with the business activities of the Company.  As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or Employees has committed any material unfair
labor practice in connection with the operation of the business of the Company, and there is no material charge or complaint
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable governmental agency pending
or threatened in writing.

                (g)      Pension Plans.  The Company or a Subsidiary does not and has not ever maintained a plan subject to the

that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has at any time owned, operated, occupied or leased.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any Company Material Contract, except in each
case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  Since March 31, 2004, no counterparty to any Company Material Contract
disclosed, or required to be disclosed, on the Company Disclosure Schedule in response to Sections 3.12(a)(iv), (a)(v) and (a)(xii)
above, has given notice in writing of any intention to cancel or otherwise terminate prior to the end of the applicable contract
term, such Company Material Contract.

        3.13     Takeover Statutes.  The Company Board has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of
the DGCL, and any other similar Legal Requirement, will not apply to Parent or Purchaser during the pendency of this Agreement,

                                                                        -42-

including the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer
and the consummation of the Merger).

        3.14     Rights Plan.  The Company has taken all actions necessary to render the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to
the execution and delivery of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the consummation of
the Merger).

        3.15     Brokers' and Finders' Fees.

                (a)      No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Credit Suisse First Boston
LLC ("CSFB") pursuant to an engagement letter dated March 4, 2005, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Company, is
entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby.

                (b)      True and correct copies of all agreements between the Company and CSFB concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation, any fee arrangements, have been previously provided or made available to Parent.

        3.16     Off-Balance Sheet Transactions and Public Accountant.  There have been no "off-balance sheet arrangements", as
such term is defined in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, effected by the Company or its Subsidiaries since March 31, 2002.
To the Knowledge of the Company, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is, and has been throughout the periods covered by the financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Reports, "independent" with respect to the Company within the meaning of Regulation S-X.

        3.17     No Undisclosed Liabilities.  Except as disclosed in the Company Financials or the Company SEC Reports, since the
date of the Company Balance Sheet and through the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
required under GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet which, has or would be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, except for (a) liabilities set forth or reflected in the Company Balance Sheet or identified in the
related notes thereto; (b) liabilities incurred since the date of the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business; and

                                                                        -43-

(c) liabilities incurred in connection with the tender offer (as may be amended from time to time) for the Company's Common Stock
commenced by infoUSA, Inc. and DII Acquisition Corp. on February 24, 2005, or pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby,including the Offer and the Merger.

        3.18     Potential Conflict of Interest.  Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports, since March 31, 2004 and through
the date hereof, there have been no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their respective affiliates, on the other hand, that would be required to be disclosed under
Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (except for amounts due as normal salaries and bonuses and in reimbursements of
ordinary expenses).  Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding "extension of credit" to directors or officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

        3.19     Properties.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have good title, free and clear of all Liens, to all
material tangible properties and assets reflected in the Company Financials contained in the Company's quarterly report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal period ended December 31, 2004, as being owned by Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof, and all
material tangible properties and assets purchased by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2004 which are
material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's business as currently conducted, other than (i) any properties or
assets that have been sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of such Company Financials,
(ii) Liens disclosed in the notes to such Company Financials and (iii) Liens arising in the ordinary course of business after the
date of such Company Financials. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns or operates, or has ever owned or operated,
any real property.

        3.20     Insurance.  Company and each of its Subsidiaries is presently insured, and during each of the past three calendar
years has been insured, against such risks, as to the Company's Knowledge, that companies engaged in a similar business would, in
accordance with good business practice, customarily be insured.  The policies of fire, theft, liability and other insurance
maintained with respect to the assets or businesses of Company and its Subsidiaries provide, to the Company's Knowledge, adequate

                                                                        -44-

coverage against loss.  All such policies are in full force and effect and all premiums due thereon have been paid to the date
hereof.  Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the terms of such policies. As of the
consummation of the Offer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to have coverage under such policies and bonds with
respect to events occurring prior to the consummation of the Offer.  As of the date hereof, there is no claim pending under any of
such policies as to which coverage has been denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies. The Company has no Knowledge
of any threatened termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any such policies.

        3.21     Opinion of Financial Advisor.  The Company Board has received the opinion of CSFB dated March 24, 2005, to the
effect that, as of the date thereof, the Offer Price is fair from a financial point of view to the Company Securityholders (other
than affiliates of the Company).  The Company will deliver, promptly after its receipt, a true and complete copy of such opinion to
the Parent.  The Company has been authorized by CSFB to permit the inclusion of such opinion in its entirety in the Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement.

        3.22     Required Vote.  The only vote of holders of any class or series of Company capital stock necessary to approve and
adopt this Agreement is, if required by applicable Law, the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The affirmative vote of any holders of any other class of
Company capital stock is not necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        3.23     Employment Agreements.  At least two of the following three individuals are Employees of the Company and have not
anticipatorily repudiated the Employment Agreements: William C. Park, Gerardo Capiel and Kevin Johnson; provided, however, that with
respect to any such individual, in the event such individual's employment with the Company is terminated for death or disability,
such individual shall nonetheless be deemed to be an Employee of the Company and have not anticipatorily repudiated the Employment
Agreements.  The failure of such representation to be true as of immediately prior to the expiration date of the Offer shall be
deemed to be a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                                                                        -45-

        3.24     Other Agreements.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any Contract with any officer
or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


                                                                ARTICLE IV

                                               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT
                                                             AND PURCHASER

         Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company, except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports (as defined in
Section 4.3) filed on or prior to the date hereof and except as disclosed in the disclosure  letter supplied by Parent and Purchaser
to the Company dated as of the date hereof (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"), as follows:

        4.1      Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents; Subsidiaries.

                (a)      Organization; Standing and Power.  Each of Parent and the Purchaser and each of their respective
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other organization duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organi zation, has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or to be good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be.

                (b)      Charter Documents.  Each of Parent and Purchaser has delivered or made available to the Company: (i) a
true and correct copy of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or like organizational documents), each as amended to date
(collectively, the "Parent Charter Documents") and (ii) the Subsidiary Charter Documents of each of its Subsidiaries, and each such

                                                                        -46-

instrument is in full force and effect.  Neither Parent nor Purchaser is in violation of any of the provisions of the Parent
Charter Documents and each of its Subsidiaries are not in violation of their respective Subsidiary Charter Documents, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be.

        4.2      Authority; Non-Contravention; Necessary Consents.

                (a)      Authority.  Each of Parent and Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger).  The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the
consummation of the Merger) has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Purchaser and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), subject only to the filing of the Certificate
of Merger pursuant to Delaware Law.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent and
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws relating to
creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

                (b)      Non-Contravention.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser does not, and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not: (i) conflict with or violate the Parent Charter Documents or any
other Subsidiary Charter Documents of any Subsidiary of Parent or (ii)  subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in
Section 4.2(c), conflict with or violate any Legal Requirement applicable to Parent, Purchaser or any of Parent's other
Subsidiaries or by which Parent, Purchaser or any of Parent's other Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is bound, or
(iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation
of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Parent Material Contract
except, with respect to clause (ii) or (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which

                                                                        -47-

(a) would not substantially impair the Parent or Purchaser from performing its obligations hereunder and (b) would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.  As used in this Agreement, "Parent Material Contract" shall mean any Contract, or group of
Contracts with a Person (or group of affiliated Persons), the termination or breach of which would be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect on any material division or business unit or other material operating group of product or service offerings
of Parent or otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                (c)      Necessary Consents.   No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by Parent or Purchaser in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the consummation of
the Merger), except for (A) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which Company and/or Parent are qualified to do business,
and (B)  such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under
applicable federal, foreign and state securities (or related) laws and antitrust and trade competition laws (including the HSR Act).

        4.3      SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

                (a)      Parent has filed all required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated by reference) required to be filed by it with the
SEC since March 31, 2002.  Parent has made available to the Company all such registration statements, prospectuses, reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents in the form filed with the SEC.  All such required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including those that Parent may file subsequent to the
date hereof), as amended, are referred to herein as the "Parent SEC Reports."  As of their respective dates (or if subsequently
amended or supplemented, on the date of such amendment or supplement), the Parent SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance and
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                                                                        -48-

                (b)      The Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, and if applicable, the Proxy Statement (and in each case any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto), will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable federal securities laws.
The Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, and if applicable, the Proxy Statement, when filed with the SEC and on the date first
published, sent or given to the Company Securityholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Purchaser
with respect to information supplied by the Company in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the ScheduleTO or the
Offer Documents, or if applicable, the Proxy Statements.  The information provided by Parent and Purchaser in writing to the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 or, if applicable, the Proxy Statement will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

        4.4      Funds.  Parent has as of the date of this Agreement, and will have upon the expiration date of the Offer (as the
same may be extended from time to time pursuant to this Agreement) and at the Effective Time, and will make available to Purchaser
at the expiration date of the Offer and at the Effective Time, through cash on hand and/or its committed credit facility (a true and
complete copy of which has been made available to the Company), the funds necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger.

        4.5      No Company Shares.  As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Purchaser beneficially owns any shares of Company
capital stock.

        4.6      Brokers' and Finders Fees.  No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Stephens
Inc. pursuant to an engagement letter dated March 25, 2005, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to
any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby.

                                                                        -49-

                                                                ARTICLE V

                                                  CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME

        5.1      Conduct of Business by the Company.

                (a)      Ordinary Course.  During the period from the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms or the Appointment Time, the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries shall,
except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, or to the extent that
Parent shall otherwise consent in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, carry on its
business, in all material respects, in the ordinary course and use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) preserve intact its
present business organization, (ii) keep available the services of its present executive officers, and (iii) preserve its
relationships with customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, and others with which it has business dealings; provided, however,
that no failure by the Company to take any action otherwise required by this Section 5.1 shall be deemed to constitute a breach of,
or inaccuracy in, any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement if and to the extent that
Parent shall consent to such failure in writing pursuant to this Section 5.1.

                (b)      Required Consent.  In addition, without limiting the generality of Section 5.1(a), except as permitted by

written consent of Parent,  during the period from the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms or the Appointment Time, the Company shall not do any of the following, and shall not permit its
Subsidiaries to do any of the following:

coordinate and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white
papers, arguments, opinions and proposals submitted to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with any investigations or proceedings in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the consummation of the Merger) (including under any antitrust or fair trade Legal Requirement), coordinate with the
other in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings,
presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Entity in

provided that with respect to any such filing, presentation or submission, each of Parent and the Company need not supply the other

                                                                        -65-

of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information.

                (c)      Notification.  Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company will notify the other promptly upon the receipt
of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any
request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information
provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements.  If a party hereto intends to independently participate

the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting.  Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 6.7(a), Parent, Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly

                                                                        -66-

        6.8      Notification of Certain Matters.

                (a)      By the Company.  The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser of any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of the Company to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement,
in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Annex A or Article VII would not be satisfied.

                (b)      By Parent.  Parent and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Company of any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case,
such that the conditions set forth in Annex A or Article VII would not be satisfied.

                (c)      The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto.

        6.9      Third-Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the Company will each use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any material consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries'
respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        6.10     Employees and Employee Benefits.

                (a)      Parent Plans.  On and after the Effective Time (or, at the discretion of Parent, the expiration of
applicable existing Company or Company Subsidiary policies or Contracts if later), Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent shall
provide to Employees and employees of the Surviving Corporation who shall have been Employees of the Company immediately prior to

                                                                        -67-

the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") participation in benefit plans offered to similarly situated employees of Parent and/or
its Subsidiary (the "Parent Plans") provided such Continuing Employees satisfy the eligibility requirements of the Parent Plans
taking into consideration years of service described in Section 6.10(b).

                (b)      Service Credit.  Following the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary actions to provide that
Continuing Employees will receive full credit for years of service with Company and any of its Subsidiaries under the Parent Plans.
Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent shall give credit under those of its Parent Plans that are welfare benefit plans for all
co-payments made, amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and time accrued against applicable waiting
periods, by Continuing Employees (including their eligible dependents), in respect of the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs.  Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent shall waive all requirements for evidence of insurability and pre-existing
conditions otherwise applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such evidence or conditions would have been waived
had the Continuing Employees been Parent/Subsidiary Employees during their period of services with the Company, under the Parent
Plans in which such Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or following the Effective Time.

        6.11     Indemnification.
                (a)      From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its present
and former directors and officers and any other Employee (the "Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification provisions set forth
in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, in each case to the full extent permitted by applicable law.  The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by
law.

                                                                        -68-

                (b)      For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy as of the date hereof in an amount and on terms no less favorable than those applicable to the
current directors and officers of the Company.

                (c)      If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.11.

                (d)      This Section 6.11 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their
successors and assigns.

        6.12     Prohibition on Acquiring Shares.  Except as contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the Offer and the Merger,
at all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII hereof and the Appointment Time, Parent shall not acquire, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that none of its affiliates and associates (as such terms are defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL) acquire, (i) beneficial ownership of, (ii) the right to acquire pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options or otherwise, or (iii) the right to
vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, any Company Shares.

        6.13     Section 16 Matters.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required (to the extent permitted under applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I and Article II of this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

                                                                        -69-

        6.14     Purchaser Compliance.  Parent shall cause Purchaser to comply with all of Purchaser's obligations under or
relating to this Agreement.  Purchaser shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with the Offer or the Merger
with and into the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

        6.15     Stockholder Litigation.  The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at Parent's expense in
(but not control) the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and its officers, directors or
affiliates relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that Parent shall have executed a joint
defense agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.  The Company shall not agree to any settlement of such stockholder
litigation without Parent's consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

        6.16     Assumption of Retention Agreements. Effective upon the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser hereby expressly
assume and agree to perform the retention agreements by and between the Company and key employees identified in Section 3.10(e) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, which were revised on January 25, 2005 and further amended as of March 4, 2005, in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform such retention agreements if no such succession had taken
place.

                        (iii)    No Order.  No court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) which (i) is in effect and (ii) has the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibits consummation of the Merger.

                                                                ARTICLE VIII

                                                                        -71-

8.1(b) shall not be available to any party hereto who has breached in any material respect any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or with respect to the Company, a stockholder has breached in any material
respect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of such stockholder in a Stockholder Agreement) and in each
case such breach has been the principal cause of or resulted in any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A having
failed to be satisfied on or before the Initial Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date;

                (c)      by the Company,

                        (i)      prior to the Appointment Time, if there has been a breach by the Parent or Purchaser of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, which breach shall result in any condition set forth
in Annex A not being satisfied, and (A) (x) such breach is not capable of being cured, or (y) if such breach is capable of being
cured, such breach is not cured within 20 days after the breaching party receives notice of such breach from the non-breaching
party, provided that if the breaching party fails to continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach during
such 20 day cure period, then the breaching party shall no longer be entitled to such cure period), and (B) no Triggering Event
shall have occurred prior to such breach; or

                                                                        -72-

                        (ii)     upon a Change of Recommendation in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Offer in accordance with Section 6.1(d); provided, however, it is a condition precedent to the Company's right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(ii), that the Company shall have complied in all material respects with the
provisions of Section 6.1 with respect to the Superior Offer which resulted in such Change of Recommendation, and Section 8.3(b)(i).

                (d)      by Parent,

                        (i)       prior to the Appointment Time, if there has been a breach by Company of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, which breach shall result in any condition set forth in Annex A not
being satisfied, and (x) such breach is not capable of being cured, or (y) if such breach is capable of being cured, such breach is
not cured within 20 days after the breaching party receives notice of such breach from the non-breaching party, provided that if the
breaching party fails to continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach during such 20 day cure period, then
the breaching party shall no longer be entitled to such cure period); or

                        (ii)     if a Triggering Event (as defined below in this Section 8.1) shall have occurred at any time prior
to the adoption of this Agreement by the required vote of the stockholders of the Company (if required); or

                        (iii)    the Offer shall have remained open for not less than forty (40) business days, all of the
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto, other than the Minimum Condition and the conditions in paragraphs (c) and (e) of Annex A
hereto, are, immediately prior to such termination, satisfied without giving effect to any waiver thereof, and the Minimum Condition
has not been satisfied.

                (e)      by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action (including the failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Offer or the Merger such that the conditions set forth in Article VII or Annex A shall not
be capable of being satisfied, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable.

        8.2      Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any party or parties hereto, as

                                                                        -73-

other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (i) as set forth in Section 6.5(a), this Section 8.2, and Section 8.3 and
Article IX hereof, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) that nothing herein shall relieve any
party or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.  No termination of this Agreement
shall affect the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

        8.3      Fees and Expenses.

                (a)      General.  Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this

consummated except that each of the Company and Parent shall pay one-half of the expenses related to any filing made under the HSR
Act.

                (b)      Company Payments.

                        (i)      In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section8.1(c)(ii) , the
Company shall concurrently with (and as a condition precedent to its right to terminate pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), if
applicable), pay Parent a fee equal to five million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($5,250,000) in immediately available funds
(the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

                        (ii)     The Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within five (5) business days after demand by Parent, in
the event that (1) (A)this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and all of the conditions
(other than the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) and (e)) set forth in Annex A hereto are immediately prior to such
termination satisfied (without giving effect to any waiver thereof) and the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, or (B) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) hereof prior to the Appointment Time, or (C) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii) hereof prior to the Appointment Time, and (2) following the execution and

(or with respect to infoUSA, Inc. and DII Acquisition Corp., such entities shall modify their existing Acquisition Proposal such
that the net cash price offered to Company Securityholders exceeds the Offer Price) and shall not have publicly withdrawn such
Acquisition Proposal, and (3) within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement, either an Acquisition is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition.

                        (iii)    Interest and Costs; Other Remedies.  The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements,
Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to
this Section 8.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this
Section 8.3(b) at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.  Payment of the fees
described in this Section 8.3(b) shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement.

Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, provided, after any such adoption, no amendment shall
be made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further stockholder approval.  This Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company.

        8.5      Extension; Waiver.  Subject to applicable law and the other provision of this Agreement (including Section 1.3(c)),

party contained herein.  Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.  Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right.

                                                                ARTICLE IX

agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the

successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation

declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.  The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision
of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

                                                                        -80-

        9.7      Other Remedies; Specific Performance.

                (a)      Other Remedies.  Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon
a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party,
and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.  The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached.

                (b)      Specific Performance.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of

in equity.

agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent the Court of Chancery
has jurisdiction over the claims alleged in such litigation, or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction over the claims

to plead or claim in any Delaware court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party
to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2.  Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

        9.9      Rules of Construction.  The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

                                                                        -81-

        9.10     Assignment.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or Purchaser may transfer or
assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, the right to purchase all or a portion of the

                                             ****AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION****



                                                                ANNEX A

                                                        CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER


         Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 25, 2005 (the "Agreement") by and among
Acxiom Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Adam Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Purchaser"), and Digital Impact, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") (capitalized terms that are used but not
otherwise defined in this Annex A shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement).


         Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer and in addition to (and not in limitation of) the rights of Purchaser to
extend and amend the Offer at any time in its sole discretion (subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement), Purchaser
shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c)
under the Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Purchaser to pay for or return tendered Company Shares promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction
referred to above, the payment for, any tendered Company Shares if by the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended pursuant
to Section 1.1(c) of the Agreement), (i) the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, (ii) each of any waiting period under the
HSR Act applicable to the purchase of the Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and the waiting period under any other comparable
antitrust or trade regulation reasonably deemed applicable to the purchase of the Company Shares pursuant to the Offer by the
parties shall not have expired or terminated or (iii) any of the following events shall have occurred and continue to exist:

                (a)      there shall be pending or overtly threatened any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
(i) challenging the acquisition by Purchaser or Parent of any Company Shares (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger, or (iii) seeking a Restricted Divestiture;

                (b)      there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction enacted, entered, enforced,
promulgated, or deemed applicable, pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Government Entity, to the Offer
or the Merger, or any other action shall be taken by any Governmental Entity, , that is reasonably likely to result in any of the
consequences referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph )(a) of this Annex A;

                (c)      any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement (i) shall not have
been true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Agreement, and (ii) shall not be true and correct in all respects on
and as of the scheduled expiration date of the Offer with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date, (in the case
of clause (i) and (ii) disregarding all qualifications based on "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and the like) except, in
the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), (A) for any failure to be so true and correct as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and (B) for changes
contemplated by this Agreement;

                                                                        -2-

                (d)      there shall have occurred and be continuing at the time immediately prior to such obligation of Purchaser
(i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on any national securities exchange in the United
States or the Nasdaq Stock Market's National Market (other than a shortening of trading hours or any trading halt triggered solely
as a result of a specified increase or decrease in a market index), or (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension
of payments in respect of banks in the United States;

                (e)      the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any agreement, covenant or obligation of
the Company to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Appointment Time under this Agreement;

                (f)      since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred and be continuing any event, change or
development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company; or

                (g)      this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

and which in any such case makes it  inadvisable,  in the reasonable  and good faith  judgment of Parent or Purchaser,  to proceed
with the Offer and/or with such acceptance for payment of or payment for Shares.

         The  conditions  to the Offer set forth  herein are for the sole benefit of Parent and  Purchaser  and may be waived by
Parent and  Purchaser,  in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their sole  discretion,  other than the Minimum
Condition, which may be waived by Parent and  Purchaser  only with the prior written  consent of the Company.  The failure by
Parent and Purchaser at any time to  exercise  any of the  foregoing  rights  shall not be deemed a waiver of any such  right,
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
