(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay Seller, an amount (the " _Closing Cash
Consideration_ ") equal to the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account to be specified in a written notice delivered by
Seller to Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , that to the extent that under any Local Sale and Purchase
Agreement a Local Purchase Price is to be paid, such Local Purchase Price

the Closing under subsection (a) above shall be reduced by an amount equal to
such Local Purchase Price, as converted to U.S. Dollars in accordance with the
applicable Exchange Rate on the seventh (7th) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date. The written notice to be delivered by Seller to Purchaser
pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection shall set forth the
applicable Exchange Rate and the amount of each Local Purchase Price to be
paid at the Closing.

 

(c) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Inventory Statement_ ") in the
form set forth on _Schedule 1.5(c)_ setting forth the value of the Purchased
Inventory as of the Closing (but determined immediately prior to giving effect
to the Transactions) (the " _Closing Inventory Value_ "). The Inventory
Statement shall include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail how the
Closing Inventory Value was calculated. For purposes of determining the
Closing Inventory Value, the Purchased Inventory shall each be valued in
accordance with the methodology used by Seller in the preparation of the
Seller Financial Statements, except that the reserve for excess or obsolete
inventory and variance and overhead revaluation shall not be netted against
the gross inventory balance.

(d) During the thirty (30) Business Day period following Purchasers receipt
of the Inventory Statement, Seller shall, at Purchasers expense, provide
Purchaser and its Representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the working papers
of Seller and its Representatives relating to the Inventory Statement, and
Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser and its Representatives to provide them
with other information used in preparing the Inventory Statement reasonably
requested by Purchaser and its Representatives, including, upon reasonable
advance notice, access during normal business hours to relevant personnel and
records of Seller. The Inventory Statement shall become final and binding on
the thirtieth (30th) Business Day following delivery thereof, unless prior to
the end of such period, Purchaser delivers to Seller written notice of its
disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying in reasonable detail
the nature and amount of any disagreement. Purchaser shall be deemed to have
agreed to all items and amounts in the Inventory Statement not specifically
referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not
be subject to review under subsection (f) below.

(e) During the ten (10) Business Day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by Purchaser to Seller, the parties shall seek in good faith to
resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified therein. During such ten (10) Business Day period, Purchaser shall
provide Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the working papers of
Purchaser and its Representatives relating to such Notice of Disagreement, and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate with
Seller and its

 



5 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 Representatives to provide them with other information used in the
preparation of such Notice of Disagreement reasonably requested by Seller or
its Representatives, including, upon reasonable advance notice, access during
normal business hours to relevant personnel and records of Purchaser. Any
disputed items resolved in writing between Seller and Purchaser within such
ten (10) Business Day period shall be final and binding with respect to such
items, and if Seller and Purchaser agree in writing on the resolution of each
disputed item specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the amount so
determined shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. 

(f) If Seller and Purchaser have not resolved all such differences by the end
of such ten (10) Business Day period, Seller and Purchaser shall submit, in
writing, to PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to
act, such other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as
shall be agreed in writing by Seller and Purchaser (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "), statements detailing their views as to the correct nature
and amount of each item remaining in dispute, the amount of the Closing
Inventory Value, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written
determination as to each such disputed item, the amount of the Closing
Inventory Value, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties
for all purposes hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be
authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between the
parties in accordance with the provisions of this Section within the range of
the difference between Purchasers position with respect thereto and Sellers
position with respect thereto. The determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Independent
Accounting Firm that it reached such determination in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. Seller and Purchaser shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within twenty (20)
Business Days following the submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon
the written determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in any competent
court. Subject to the following sentence, the costs of any dispute resolution
pursuant to this subsection, including the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm and of any enforcement of the determination
thereof, shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on
the relative Dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined
by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm
is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each party
incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the Inventory
Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such party.

(g) The Closing Cash Consideration shall be adjusted downwards by the amount
(if any) by which the Closing Inventory Value, as finally determined pursuant
to this Section, is less than the Target Closing Inventory Value. The
adjustment to the Closing Cash Consideration shall be payable by check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after
the final determination of the Closing Inventory Value in accordance with this
_Section 1.5_.

Section 1.6 _Retention Bonus Pool_. Following the Closing, Purchaser will
distribute the Retention Bonus Pool to the Transferred Employees in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on _Exhibit B_.

Section 1.7  _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) _Allocation_. The parties hereto intend that the purchase of the
Purchased Assets shall be treated as a taxable transaction for all applicable
tax purposes, including for U.S. federal income tax and state income tax
purposes. Within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser and Seller
and their respective Affiliates shall agree upon the final allocation of
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement among the Purchased Assets,
which allocation shall be in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). If the Purchaser
and Seller are not able to agree on the Allocation within ninety (90) days
following the Closing, then the Allocation shall be determined by a nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller. The
Allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and Seller for all
purposes, and the parties agree that all Tax Returns (including Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 8594) and all financial statements shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with (and the parties shall not otherwise take
a position on a Tax Return that is inconsistent with) the Allocation unless
required by the IRS or any other applicable Taxing Authority. 

(b) _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. tax
Law or under any applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

Section 1.8 _Non-Transferable Assets_.

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Purchased Asset is not assignable or
transferable (each, a " _Non-Transferable Asset_ ") without a Consent, and any
such Consent is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement
and the related instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or
transfer of such Non-Transferable Asset, and Purchaser or its designee(s)
shall not assume Sellers rights or obligations under such Non-Transferable
Asset (and such Non-Transferable Asset shall not be included in the Purchased
Assets), and instead Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any such Consent as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date and thereafter Seller shall transfer and assign to Purchaser such Non-
Transferable Assets for no additional consideration. Following any such
assignment or transfer, such Non-Transferable Assets shall be deemed Purchased
Assets for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall, at Purchasers expense, use commercially
reasonable efforts (including making any necessary payments to third parties
or otherwise incurring expenses or costs) to provide Purchaser or its
designee(s) with all of the rights and benefits of (i) any Non-Transferable
Assets after the Closing as if the appropriate Consent had

 



7 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 been obtained and (ii) any Contract that is not an Assumed Contract that is
necessary for the operation of the Business as currently conducted consistent
with past practice, including if appropriate, by performing such services
under a contract for the benefit of Purchaser. Seller shall advise Purchaser
in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing with respect
to any Assumed Contract which Seller knows or has substantial reason to
believe will or may not be assignable or transferable to Purchaser hereunder
at the Closing.

each such material Employee Plan (or, in the case of Employee Plans that are
subject to ERISA and made available to employees of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries generally, summaries of the benefits provided under such plan),
_provided_ that, with respect to each International Plan that Purchaser is

could have any Liability, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code,
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar applicable state Law, or, with respect
to an International Plan, similar Applicable Laws. Neither the execution of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents nor the consummation of the
Transactions (either together with or upon the occurrence of any additional
or subsequent events) will

 



13 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 constitute an event under any Employee Plan or other Contract, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any national collective agreement applicable to
any business employee, that will or may reasonably be expected to result in
any payment (including severance or termination pay) or any acceleration,
vesting, increase, funding (including the segregation of assets to fund) or
provision of benefits thereunder, in each case, to any Business Employee (or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof), whether or not any such payment or
benefit would be an "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code), excluding in each case such severance or termination pay
or other benefit as required to be provided under Applicable Laws.

(e) _Compliance with Law_. Each Employee Plan is now and always in the past
seven (7) years has been operated in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and the requirements of all Applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and with respect to an International Plan, with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutory or regulatory Applicable Laws. Seller and
each of its Subsidiaries have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it and Seller does not have
any Knowledge of any default or violation in any material respect by any
other party to any Employee Plan. There are no Actions or claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, anticipated or expected to be asserted with respect to any
Employee Plan or any related trust or other funding medium thereunder. With
respect to non-U.S. entities, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries have in all

qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code, and
any related trust established in connection with such Employee Plan that is
intended to be exempt under 501(a) of the Code, has received a timely
favorable determination, advisory and/or opinion letter from the IRS,
covering all of the provisions applicable to the Employee Plan for which
determination, advisory and/or opinion letters are currently available, that
the Employee Plan is so qualified and the related trust is so tax exempt. To
the Knowledge of Seller, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination, advisory and/or opinion letter or letters from the IRS that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Employee Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

(g) _International Plans_. _Section 2.9(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule

_International Plan_ " means an Employee Plan that is maintained outside the

International Plan required by Applicable Law or by the terms of such

applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices, and a pro
rata contribution for the period prior to and including the date of this
Agreement has been made or accrued; (ii) except as would not be material, the
fair market value of the assets of each funded International Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any International Plan funded through insurance
or the book reserve established for any International Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
benefits determined on an ongoing basis accrued to the date of this Agreement
with respect to all current

 and former participants under such International Plan, according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such International Plan, and the Transactions shall not
cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit
obligations; and (iii) each International Plan required to be registered has
been registered and has been maintained in all material respects in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities and is approved by any
applicable taxation authorities to the extent such approval is available.

and enforceable (other than pending applications thereof), and has not been
abandoned or passed into the public domain. Seller or one of its Subsidiaries
is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to all
Seller Assigned Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Seller, there are
no facts, circumstances, or information that would or reasonably could be
expected to render any of the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property invalid or
unenforceable. There are no facts, circumstances or information that would or
reasonably could be expected to adversely affect, limit, restrict, impair, or
impede the ability of Purchaser to use, practice and otherwise exploit the
Seller Intellectual Property upon the Closing in the same manner as

continued prosecution or maintenance of such Registered Seller Intellectual
Property) other than any requirement that, if not satisfied, would not result
in a cancellation of any such registration or otherwise affect the use,
priority or enforceability of the Trademark in question, the defenses
potentially available to any accused infringer thereof, or the remedies
potentially available for infringement thereof.

(ii) No Trademark included in the Registered Seller Intellectual Property has
been involved in any opposition or cancellation proceeding in the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office or any corresponding office, department, organization,
agency or other Governmental Entity elsewhere, and no such proceeding has

validity of such Trademark, in any territory.

action or failed to take any action (including a failure to disclose required
information to the U.S. Copyright Office, or any corresponding office,
department, organization, agency or other Governmental Entity elsewhere where

Copyrights included in the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property in a manner
that would result in (or reasonably be expected to result in) the invalidity
or unenforceability of any such Copyright, or that would result in (or
reasonably be expected to result in) such Copyright passing into the public
domain. Seller and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps to protect
their rights in and to their Copyrights included in the Seller Assigned
Intellectual Property.

 

(e) _Trade Secrets_. Seller and its Subsidiaries have taken necessary and
appropriate steps in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards
and Applicable Law, in any event no less than reasonable steps, to protect
their rights in, and to safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality
of, the information and materials that derive independent economic
value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or
to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use
included in the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property. Other than pursuant to
a valid and enforceable confidentiality agreement with respect thereto,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has authorized the disclosure of
any Trade Secret included in the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property, nor
has any such Trade Secret been disclosed.

Contracts that provide for no more than a limited right to use Trademarks in

selling, licensing or otherwise distributing Seller Products and (C) stand-
alone non-disclosure agreements that do no more than grant to third parties
limited scope and use rights with respect to the Trade Secrets in the Seller
Assigned Intellectual Property for the limited purposes set forth therein and
which do not allocate rights materially different than in Sellers standard
form of non-disclosure agreement.

(iii) All Inbound License Agreements and all Outbound License Agreements
(together, the " _Seller License Agreements_ ") that are Assumed Contracts are
in full force and effect, and enforceable in accordance with their terms.
There is no outstanding dispute or disagreement threatened in writing, or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, otherwise threatened, with respect to any Seller

(v) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents and such other agreements, documents and instruments to
be executed and delivered after the date hereof, nor the consummation of this
transaction will violate or result in the breach, material modification,
cancellation, termination or suspension of, or acceleration of any
payments under any Seller License Agreement (or give rise to any right with
respect to any of the foregoing). Following the Closing Date, Purchaser will
have and be permitted to exercise all rights under the Seller License
Agreements that are Assumed Contracts (and will have the same rights with
respect to the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights of third

are no substantial alterations, modifications or updates to the System
intended or currently required by Seller or its Subsidiaries or, to the

operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries. Seller and its Subsidiaries have
taken commercially reasonable steps and implemented commercially reasonable
safeguards to protect the Systems from Contaminants. The Systems, the
procedures and processes of Seller and its Subsidiaries for supporting and

and conditions described in their respective employment offers or independent
contractor agreements, as the case may be, as determined in the sole

execution of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the

the appropriate Taxing Authority; _provided_ , that if such bill covers any
part of the Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall also remit prior to the due
date of such Property Taxes to Purchaser payment for the proportionate amount
of such bill that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the event
that either Seller or Purchaser shall thereafter provide the other party with
evidence of having made a payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement
under this _Section 5.4(a)_, the other party shall make such reimbursement
promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the presentation
of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the
presenting party is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay when
due seventy-five percent (75%) of any Transfer Taxes and Seller shall be
responsible for and shall pay when due twenty-five percent (25%) of any
Transfer Taxes; _provided_ that, in the case of value added Taxes and
similar Taxes (" _VAT_ ") incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby for which Purchaser will be clearly entitled under
Applicable Law to

 



41 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 receive a full credit or refund, then one hundred percent (100%) of the
amount of such VAT shall be validly invoiced by Seller to Purchaser and paid
by Purchaser to Seller, at least five (5) Business Days before those amounts
must be remitted by Seller to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with
Applicable Law. The parties hereto shall cooperate, to the extent reasonably
requested and as permitted by Applicable Law, in minimizing any such Transfer
Taxes. The party required by Applicable Law to file a Tax Return with respect
to such Transfer Taxes shall do so within the time period prescribed by
Applicable Law, and the non-filing party shall promptly remit to the filing
party the amount of any Transfer Taxes so payable by the filing party upon
receipt of notice that such Transfer Taxes are payable by the filing party. In
the event that a filing party shall make a payment for which it is entitled
to reimbursement under this _Section 5.4(b)_, the non-filing party shall
make such reimbursement promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after the presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the filing party is entitled along with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of
reimbursement. Any reimbursement payment required under this _Section 5.4(b)_
and not made when due shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%)

respect to Transfer Taxes under this _Section 5.4(b)_.

Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim or proceeding relating
to any Tax Return. In the event any Taxing Authority informs Seller or
Purchaser of any notice of proposed audit, claim, assessment or other dispute
concerning an amount of Taxes related to the Business, the Purchased Assets or
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property with respect to which the other party
may incur Liability hereunder, the party so informed shall promptly notify
the other party of such matter; _provided_ that, failure to promptly notify
shall not reduce the other partys indemnity obligation hereunder, except to
the extent such partys ability to defend against such matter is actually
prejudiced thereby; and _provided further_ , that resolution of such audit,
claim, assessment or other dispute shall be governed by _Section 8.3_ (
_Third Party Actions_ ).

 

(e) _Effect on Indemnity Rights of the Parties_. Nothing in this _Section

Section 5.5 _Further Actions_.

(a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing, at the other partys
request, each of Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to (i) execute and deliver to the other party such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation,
provide such materials and information and take such other actions as the
requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order
to effectively transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser, and to confirm
Purchasers title to, all of the Purchased Assets, free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law or contract,
to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control of the Purchased
Assets, and to cause the parties to fulfill their respective obligations under
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents; (ii) cooperate with the other
party to enforce the terms of any Assumed Contract, including terms relating
to confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights, and to contest or defend
against any Action relating to the Transactions or to the operation of the
Business before the Closing Date; (iii) cooperate with the other party in its
efforts to continue and maintain for the benefit of Purchaser those business
relationships of Seller existing prior to the Closing and relating to the
business to be operated by Purchaser after the Closing; (iv) satisfy the
Excluded Liabilities in a manner that is not detrimental to any of such
relationships; (v) assume the Assumed Liabilities; (vi) refer to Purchaser
all inquiries relating to the Business; and (vii) promptly deliver to
Purchaser (A) any mail, packages and other communications addressed to Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Business and (B) any cash or other
property that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries receives and that properly
belongs to Purchaser, including any insurance proceeds, payments with respect
to accounts receivable of the Business arising after the Closing, and interest
payable thereon.

(b) If after the Closing, either Purchaser or Seller in good faith identifies
any asset of Seller or its Subsidiaries properly transferrable as a Purchased
Asset that falls in one of the categories set forth in _Sections 1.1(d)_ ,
_1.1(g)_ , _1.1(h)_ , _1.1(i)_ , _1.1(j)_ or _1.1(k)_ that was not included in
the Purchased Assets transferred at the Closing (any such asset, a " _Later
Identified Asset_ "), then either Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, will
provide written notice to the other party identifying such Later Identified
Asset and Seller will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, as promptly as
practicable after written notice by Purchaser, transfer, convey, assign,
deliver, or cause to be transferred, conveyed, assigned, or delivered to
Purchaser, all right, title and interest of Seller and its Subsidiaries in
and to such Later Identified Asset which is transferable, and such Later
Identified Assets shall be deemed to be Purchased Assets for purposes of this
Agreement and any applicable Transaction Document, effective as of the date
of transfer, conveyance, assignment, or delivery. If within thirty (30) days
after the Closing, Seller specifically identifies in writing to Purchaser an
Excluded Asset that was transferred, conveyed, assigned, or
delivered inadvertently by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, then Purchaser will as promptly as practicable after
written notice by Seller, transfer, convey, assign, or deliver back to Seller
all such transferred right, title and interest of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries in and to such Excluded Asset which is transferable.

 



43 CONFIDENTIAL



 

(c) To the extent that Purchaser cannot be granted physical possession of any
Purchased Asset as of the Closing Date, such Purchased Asset shall be held by
Seller for and on behalf of Purchaser until such time as Purchaser is able to
take possession thereof.

 

Section 5.6 _Seller Intellectual Property_.

(a) Unless specifically permitted in this Agreement or the Intellectual
Property Agreement, Seller agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, it
shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives not to, retain (other than as retained through automated
retention or backup processes) or use any copy of any of the Seller Assigned
Intellectual Property. Without limitation of _Section 5.5_ ( _Further
Actions_ ), if Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or any assignee or successor
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) retains any right or interest in any
Seller Assigned Intellectual Property that cannot be, or for any reason is
not, assigned to Purchaser at the Closing, Seller hereby grants, on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries, successors and assigns (and agrees to so grant or
cause to be so granted) to Purchaser, effective as of the Closing, a
perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free and fully paid-up, transferable,
sublicensable (through multiple levels), exclusive, worldwide right and
license to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform (whether publicly
or otherwise), prepare derivative works of and otherwise modify, make, sell,
offer to sell, import and otherwise use and exploit, and exercise and practice
all rights under, all or any portion of such Seller Assigned Intellectual
Property.

 

(b) If Purchaser is unable to enforce any of the Seller Assigned Intellectual
Property against a third party as a result of any Applicable Law that
prohibits enforcement of such rights by a transferee of such rights, Seller
agrees to assign to Purchaser such rights as may be required by Purchaser to
enforce such Seller Assigned Intellectual Property in its own name. If
such assignment still does not permit Purchaser to enforce Seller Assigned
Intellectual Property against the third party, Seller agrees to initiate or
join proceedings against such third party at Purchasers request. Purchaser
shall control such proceedings and shall be responsible for the costs and
expenses of such proceedings (including Sellers reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred in participating in such proceedings at Purchasers request).

 

Section 5.7 _Records and Documents_. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing, at Purchasers request, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide, at Purchasers expense, Purchaser and its
Representatives with access to and the right to make copies of those records
and documents related to the Business, the possession of which is retained by
Seller or its Subsidiaries, as may be necessary or useful in connection with
Purchasers conduct of the Business after the Closing. If during such period
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries elects to dispose of such records
and documents, Seller shall give Purchaser sixty (60) days prior written
notice, during which period Purchaser shall have the right to take such
records and documents without further consideration.

 

Section 5.8 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

(a) From and after the date hereof and until three (3) years after the
Closing, Seller, its successors and their Affiliates shall not, directly or
indirectly, whether on such Persons own behalf or on behalf of some other
Person (i) participate, sponsor, organize,

 



44 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 encourage, or invest, or attempt to do any of the foregoing, in any Person
or activity that is competitive with the Business, (ii) cause, induce, solicit
or encourage any contractor, vendor, service provider, strategic partner or
actual or prospective customer of the Business (the " _Covered Persons_ ") to
terminate such status or advise any Person against entering into such status;
(iii) solicit business that is primarily related to the Business from or
provide services that are primarily related to the Business to, any Person who
was a Covered Person within the twenty-four (24) months preceding the date
thereof; (iv) otherwise intentionally disrupt or interfere with, or attempt
to disrupt or interfere with, the relations of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates with any Covered Person in connection with the Business; or (v)
disparage or make any false statements (whether in oral, written, electronic
or other form) to any media source, industry member-company or group,
financial institution or Covered Person regarding Purchaser or its Affiliates
in connection with the Business; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall
not prohibit Seller, its successors and their Affiliates from, collectively,
owning as a passive investment ten percent (10%) or less of the equity of any
publicly-traded entity. For purposes of the foregoing, a Person who is not a
customer of the Business shall be considered a "prospective customer" if, to
the Knowledge of Seller, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries made a presentation
or written proposal to such Person primarily related to the Business during
the twenty-four (24) month period preceding the date hereof or was preparing
to make such a presentation or proposal on the date hereof.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the date that is one (1) year after
the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries will not directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, solicit any Transferred
Employee for employment by Seller or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_
, that Seller and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to solicit for employment
and to hire any such employees who are contacted as a result of the use of
general newspaper or online advertisement and other general non-targeted
recruitment techniques in the ordinary course of business, as opposed to
targeted solicitations of any one or more of such Transferred Employees. 

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the date that is one (1) year after
the Closing Date, Purchasers Datacenter and Connected Systems Group ("
_DCSG_ ") will not directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent
of the Seller, solicit any Seller Retained Business Employee, any employee of
Sellers Fibre Channel group (other than any employee located in Minnesota)
or any Seller employee located at Sellers facility in Pune, India (other than
any employee that is a Business Employee that is offered employment by
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.3_), for employment by its Communications and
Networking Group; _provided_ , _however_ , that DCSG will be permitted to
solicit for employment and to hire any such employees who are contacted as a
result of the use of general newspaper or online advertisement and other
general non-targeted recruitment techniques in the ordinary course of
business, as opposed to targeted solicitations of any one or more of such
employees.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of
this _Section 5.8_ would be inadequate and that, in addition to any other
remedies available, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of any
such breach. The duration of the restrictions set forth in clauses (a), and
(b) of this Section shall be extended by a period of time equal to the number
of days, if any,

 



45 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 during which Seller or any of its Affiliates is in breach thereof. The
duration of the restrictions set forth in clause (c) of this Section shall be
extended by a period of time equal to the number of days, if any, during
which Purchaser is in breach thereof.

Section 5.9 _Cooperation with Warranty Claims_. Purchaser agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to process and handle all warranty claims
arising in respect of products of the Business shipped or sold prior to the
Closing. Purchaser agrees to provide to Seller a written statement setting
forth the nature and amount of any warranty claims being processed under this
_Section 5.9_ and any supporting documentation therefor. Seller agrees to
promptly and in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days after being
provided a written invoice reimburse Purchaser for all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Purchaser in performing its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.9_ that are set forth in the written statement required by this
_Section 5.9_.

Section 5.10 _Transition Services_. Purchaser will notify Seller if, prior to
the Closing, Purchaser reasonably determines that it may require additional
Transition Services to be provided by Seller in addition to those already to
be provided under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement. This notice
will include (a) a description of such additional Transition Services and any
terms upon which these services are to be provided, including the cost to be
paid by the Purchaser, if any, and (b) a correspondingly revised set of
schedules to the Transition Services Agreement to replace the schedules
included in the form of Transition Services Agreement attached hereto as
_Exhibit K_. The revised schedules to the Transition Services Agreement will
be subject to Sellers approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.11 _Inventory_.

 

(a) On the day preceding the Closing Date, Seller shall, at its expense,
conduct a physical count of the Purchased Inventory on hand after the close
of business on such day. The parties will mutually agree in advance on a plan
for the physical count of the Inventory (including a determination of the
scope thereof), and Purchaser or its Representatives shall be entitled to
observe the physical count of the Inventory pursuant to such plan.

(b) Seller shall retain all Inventory that, as of the Closing Date, is
located in the consignment stock locations outside of the U.S. (the "
_Non-U.S. Consignment Stocks_ ") of Sellers or its Subsidiaries customers or
is in transit from a distribution center to a Non-U.S. Consignment Stock (all
such Inventory, collectively the " _Non-U.S. Consignment Inventory_ ").

(c) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including, prior to the Closing,
the agreements set forth in _Section 4.1_ ( _Conduct of Business_ ) and
_Section 4.2_ ( _Restrictions on Conduct of Business_ ), Seller shall sell
the Non-U.S. Consignment Inventory for Purchasers account, as set forth in
the applicable schedule to the Transition Services Agreement. The restrictions
set forth in _Section 5.8(a)_ ( _Non-Competition_ ) shall not apply to sales
of the Non-U.S. Consignment Inventory by Seller and its Affiliates in
accordance with the preceding sentence, to the extent that such restrictions
would otherwise prevent Seller and its Affiliates from selling the Non-U.S.
Consignment Inventory. 

 



46 CONFIDENTIAL



 

(d) After the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not deliver Inventory
into the Non-U.S. Consignment Stocks (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
Inventory that is in transit to a Non-U.S. Consignment Stock on the Closing
Date and that constitutes Non-U.S. Consignment Inventory). The applicable
customers shall be served from the Non-U.S. Consignment Stocks in
accordance with the first-in-first-out principle.

Section 5.12 _Service Provider Agreements_. From the date of this
Agreement and, as applicable, continuing after the Closing, Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent or agreement of each
Service Provider under a Service Provider Agreement to split such Service
Provider Agreement so that the portion of the Service Provider Agreement
pertaining to the Business will be assigned or novated to Purchaser, in such a
manner that Purchaser will not lose the benefit of any prepayments made by
Seller to the Service Provider under the Service Provider Agreement with
respect to Seller Products. In the event that, at Closing, the Business
portion of a Service Provider Agreement cannot be assigned or novated, Seller
will provide, or cause to be provided, to Purchaser the services relating to
the Business under each such Service Provider Agreement pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement for the term of the applicable Service Provider
Agreement or until such Service Provider Agreement has been assigned or
novated to Purchaser in accordance with the first sentence of this Section.
Such Transition Services shall be provided to Purchaser in such a manner that
Purchaser will have the benefit of any prepayments made by Seller to the
Service Provider under the Service Provider Agreement with respect to Seller
Products.

contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement ( _provided_ that for the sole
purpose of determining Losses (and not for determining whether or not any
breaches or representations of warranties have occurred), the representations
and warranties of Purchaser shall not be deemed qualified by reference to
materiality);

(c) _Limitations_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses arising solely
from a claim for indemnification pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above until
the aggregate amount of all Losses under all claims of all Purchaser
Indemnitees for all such breaches shall exceed One Million Two Hundred and
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000) (the " _Basket_ "), at which time all
Losses incurred shall be subject to indemnification hereunder (subject to
subsection (c)(ii) below) including the amount of the Basket. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement (but subject to the proviso
in this sentence), Sellers aggregate Liability for indemnification pursuant
to subsection (a)(i) above shall not exceed Sixteen Million Two Hundred and
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($16,250,000); _provided, however,_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth above in this
subsection shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification based
on fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or any inaccuracy in or breach of any
Fundamental Representation, for which Sellers Liability for indemnification,
together with any Liability otherwise pursuant to subsection (a)(i), pursuant
to subsections (a)(ii) through (a)(iv) and the immediately following proviso,
shall not exceed the Purchase Price, unless the claim is of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, in which case it is not limited, _provided
further_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth above
in this subsection shall not apply with respect to any claim for
indemnification based on any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations
contained in _Section 2.7(b)_, for which Sellers Liability for

 



52 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 indemnification, together with any Liability otherwise pursuant to
subsection (a)(i) and the immediately preceding proviso, shall not exceed
Thirty-Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($32,500,000).

(ii) Sellers Liability for indemnification pursuant to subsections (a)(ii)
through (iv), together with any Liability for indemnification pursuant to
subsection (a)(i), in the aggregate, shall not exceed the Purchase Price,
unless the claim is of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, in which case
it is not limited.

 

(iii) A Purchaser Indemnitees right to indemnification under this Article
based on any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in
_Article II_ (which constitute the only representations and warranties made by
Seller in connection with the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and
the Business) shall not be diminished or otherwise affected in any way as a
result of such Purchaser Indemnitees knowledge of such inaccuracy, breach or
untruth as of the date hereof, regardless of whether such knowledge exists as
a result of the Purchaser Indemnitees investigation or as a result of
disclosure by Seller or any of its Affiliates, unless such disclosures were
set forth in this Agreement or in any applicable Schedule hereto.

(iv) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article shall be net of the amounts of any insurance proceeds which an
Indemnitee actually receives with respect to any such Losses (net of cost or
recovery, deductibles and premium increases). For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall Seller have any Liability to any Purchaser Indemnitee for the
same Losses under more than one provision of this  _Article VIII_.

(v) Each party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any of its Losses,
including evaluation of any insurance policies and other collateral sources
that would reasonably be applicable to such Loss.

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be responsible for, or have an indemnification obligation
with respect to, any Taxes (other than those allocated to Seller and its
Affiliates in  _Section 5.4(a)_ and _Section 5.4(b)_) imposed on Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates arising from or attributable to Purchasers operation
of the Business or the use or ownership of the Purchased Assets or Seller
Licensed Intellectual Property in a Post-Closing Tax Period.

(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall
have no Liability under this Article to any Purchaser Indemnitee for a breach
of _Section 2.18(b)_ to the extent that the Losses that result from such
breach constitute warranty obligations that are Excluded Liabilities and that
are subject to _Section 5.9_ and are actually paid by Seller to Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 5.9_.

 

Section 8.3 _Third Party Actions_.

(a) If Purchaser becomes aware of a third party Action that Purchaser
believes, in good faith, may result in a claim of indemnification for a
Purchaser Indemnitee 

 



53 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 under this Article (a " _Purchaser Indemnification Claim_ "), other than a
Purchaser Indemnification Claim relating to any Excluded Liability, Purchaser
shall promptly notify Seller of such Action, shall conduct the defense of
such Action and shall, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller from time
to time, give updates as to the status of such Action. Seller shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense at its sole cost and expense.
Purchaser shall seek the prior written consent of Seller (which consent may be
withheld, conditioned or delayed by Seller in its sole discretion) in
connection with Purchasers agreement to any settlement or compromise of
any such third party Action. Any such written consent by Seller shall
represent the agreement of Seller that the Losses incurred in connection
therewith shall be indemnifiable hereunder. In the event that Purchaser shall
fail to obtain such written consent of Seller, Purchaser may agree to any
such settlement or compromise, and may make a Purchaser Indemnification Claim
therefor, but the resolution of such claim (including whether and to what
extent Purchaser or any other Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement for such Purchaser Indemnification Claim) shall remain subject
to this Article.

(b) If Purchaser becomes aware of a third party Action that Purchaser
believes, in good faith, may result in a Purchaser Indemnification Claim
relating to any Excluded Liability, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of
such Action. Seller shall conduct the defense of such Action and shall, to the
extent reasonably requested by Purchaser from time to time, give updates as to
the status of such Action. Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense at its sole cost and expense. Seller may agree to any settlement
or compromise of any such third party Action in its sole discretion, so long
as such settlement or compromise (A) does not obligate any Purchaser
Indemnitee to take or refrain from taking any action and (B) provides for a
complete release of the Purchaser Indemnitee by such third party. Any such
settlement or compromise by Seller shall represent the agreement of Seller
that the Losses incurred in connection therewith shall be indemnifiable
hereunder.

(c) If Seller becomes aware of a third party Action that Seller believes, in
good faith, may result in a claim of indemnification for a Seller Indemnitee
under this Article (a " _Seller Indemnification Claim_ ") relating to any
Assumed Liability, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of such Action.
Purchaser shall conduct the defense of such Action and shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by Seller from time to time, give updates as to the
status of such Action. Seller shall be entitled to participate in any such
defense at its sole cost and expense. Purchaser may agree to any settlement
or compromise of any such third party Action in its sole discretion, so long
as such settlement or compromise (A) does not obligate any Seller Indemnitee
to take or refrain from taking any action and (B) provides for a complete
release of the Seller Indemnitee by such third party. Any such settlement or
compromise by Purchaser shall represent the agreement of Purchaser that the
Losses incurred in connection therewith shall be indemnifiable hereunder.

(d) If Seller becomes aware of a third party Action that Seller believes, in
good faith, may result in a Seller Indemnification Claim other than a Seller
Indemnification Claim relating to any Assumed Liability, Seller shall promptly
notify Purchaser of such Action. Purchaser shall have the right (exercisable
within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt by Purchaser of Sellers
notice), but not the obligation to conduct the defense thereof. The party
conducting such defense (the " _Defending Party_ ") shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by the

 



54 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 other party from time to time, give updates as to the status of such Action.
The party not conducting such defense shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense at its sole cost and expense. The Defending Party may agree to
any settlement or compromise of any such third party Action in its sole
discretion, so long as such settlement or compromise (A) does not obligate any
Indemnitee to take or refrain from taking any action and (B) provides for a
complete release of the Indemnitee by such third party. If Purchaser is the
Defending Party, any such settlement or compromise by Purchaser shall
represent the agreement of Purchaser that the Losses incurred in connection
therewith shall be indemnifiable hereunder.

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that an Indemnitee seeks a recovery in accordance with the
terms of this Article, in respect of a Purchaser Indemnification Claim or
Seller Indemnification Claim (as applicable, an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
Purchaser (on behalf of such other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or
Seller (on behalf of such other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable) shall
deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to Seller or Purchaser (such
party obligated to provide indemnification under this Article, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), as the case may be. Each Claim Notice shall, with
respect to each Indemnification Claim set forth therein, (i) specify in
reasonable detail and in good faith the nature of the Indemnification Claim
being made and (ii) state the aggregate Dollar amount of Losses to which such
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article that have
been incurred, or a good faith estimate of the aggregate Dollar amount of such
Losses reasonably expected to be incurred, by such Indemnitee pursuant to
such Indemnification Claim (the " _Claim Amount_ ").

(b) If the Indemnifying Party wishes to object to the allowance of some or
all Indemnification Claims made in a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party must
deliver a written objection to Purchaser (on behalf of any Purchaser
Indemnitee) or Seller (on behalf of any Seller Indemnitee), as the case may
be, within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party
of such Claim Notice expressing such objection and explaining in reasonable
detail and in good faith the basis therefor. Following receipt by Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, of the Indemnifying Partys written objection, if
any, Purchaser (on behalf of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or
Seller (on behalf of any other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case
may be, and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and within ten (10)
Business Days, meet to agree on the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each Indemnification Claim that is the subject of such written
objection. If the parties should so agree, (i) a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and executed by Purchaser (on behalf of any
other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or Seller (on behalf of any other
Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case may be, and the Indemnifying
Party and (ii) with respect to any Purchaser Indemnification Claim, as
promptly as practicable and within ten (10) Business Days following execution
of such memorandum, subject to subsection (d) below and  _Section 8.2(c)_ (
_Indemnification_ ), the Indemnifying Party shall pay to Purchaser (on behalf
of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) in cash the aggregate Dollar
amount of Losses payable to Purchaser (or such other Purchaser Indemnitee, if
applicable) pursuant to such memorandum and (iii) with respect to any Seller
Indemnification Claim, as promptly as practicable and within ten (10) Business
Days following execution of such memorandum, subject to subsection (d) below,
Purchaser shall pay the Claim Amount to Seller (on behalf of any other

 



55 CONFIDENTIAL



 

 Seller Indemnitee, if applicable) in cash the aggregate Dollar amount of
Losses payable to Seller (or such other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable)
pursuant to such memorandum. In the event that the parties do not prepare and
sign such a memorandum or such memorandum does not address in full the written
objections timely delivered, within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt by
Purchaser (on behalf of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or
Seller (on behalf of any other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case
may be, from the Indemnifying Party of the written objection, then Purchaser
or Seller, as the case may be, may commence an Action to resolve such
dispute and enforce its rights with respect thereto in any court available
therefor.

(c) If Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, does not receive a response
from the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Indemnification Claim set
forth in a Claim Notice by the end of the twenty (20) Business Day period
referred to in subsection (b) above, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to object to such Indemnification
Claim and to have agreed that Losses in the amount of the applicable Claim
Amount are indemnifiable hereunder and (ii) with respect to any
Purchaser Indemnification Claim, as promptly as practicable and within five
(5) Business Days following expiration of such period, subject to subsection
(d) below and _Section 8.2(c)_ ( _Indemnification_ ), Seller shall pay the
Claim Amount to Purchaser, or (iii) with respect to any Seller
Indemnification Claim, as promptly as practicable and within five (5) Business
Days following expiration of such period, subject to subsection (d) below,
Purchaser shall pay the Claim Amount to Seller. If not paid, Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, may seek enforcement of the obligation with
respect to the Indemnification Claim in any court available therefore in
accordance with the terms of _Section 10.6_ ( _Submission to Jurisdiction_ )
and _Section 8.2(c)_ ( _Indemnification_ ).

(d) Any amount payable by the Indemnifying Party to Purchaser or Seller, as
the case may be, pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) above shall be paid
promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
applicable payment obligation accrues) by the Indemnifying Party by wire
transfer of Dollars in immediately available funds to such account or accounts
as may be designated in writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.
Any amounts paid to Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, in respect of
any Indemnification Claim asserted on behalf of an Indemnitee other than
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall be received by Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, on behalf of such other Indemnitee.

 

Section 8.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, except as expressly provided otherwise, this
Article shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees from and
after the Closing Date for any claims arising under this Agreement, including
claims of inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty; 
_provided, however,_ that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver by any
party of any right to seek specific performance or injunctive relief, or any
right or remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation with respect to this Agreement.

Section 8.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Purchaser agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for all applicable tax purposes, including for U.S.
federal income tax and for state tax purposes.

TERMINATION

Section 9.1 _Termination_. At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement

or before May 19, 2012 or such other date that Purchaser and Seller may agree
upon in writing (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this subsection shall not be
available to Seller if a breach of this Agreement by Seller has resulted in
the failure of the Closing to occur before the Termination Date; and _provided
further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this subsection
shall not be available to Purchaser if the breach of this Agreement by
Purchaser has resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur before the

the Transactions shall have become final and nonappealable; 

(d) by Purchaser, if there shall be any temporary restraining order,

the Purchased Assets following the Closing or (ii) compel Purchaser to
dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of the business or assets of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Purchased Assets or
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property as a result of this Agreement or the
Transactions;

(e) by Purchaser, if (i) Seller shall have breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein and such breach shall not
have been cured within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by Seller of
written notice of such breach ( _provided, however,_ that no such cure period
shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot
be cured) and if not cured within such ten (10) Business Day period and at or
prior to the Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ ( _Conditions to Obligations of
Purchaser_ ) to be satisfied, or (ii) Seller shall have materially breached
_Section 4.5_ ( _Exclusivity_ ); or

 

(f) by Seller, if Purchaser shall have breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein and such breach shall not have been
cured within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by Purchaser of written
notice of such breach ( _provided, however,_ that no such cure period shall be
available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be
cured) and if not cured within such ten (10) Business Day period and at or
prior to the Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ ( _Conditions to Obligations
of Seller_ ) to be satisfied.

 



57 CONFIDENTIAL



 

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section (other
than subsection (a)) shall give written notice of such termination to the
other party.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_ ( _Termination_ ), this Agreement
shall be of no further force and effect and there shall be no Liability or
obligation on the part of Purchaser, Seller or their respective officers,

hereof. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (except for the
Intellectual Property Agreement) may not be assigned by operation of Law or
otherwise; _provided, however,_ that Purchaser may assign any or all of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly

conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms

Section 10.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any

mutually acceptable manner, in order that the Transactions shall be
