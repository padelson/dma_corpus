information or documentation within the knowledge or possession of such Party
as reasonably necessary to facilitate compliance with financial reporting
obligations arising under FASB Statement No. 109 (including compliance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48), and (iii) in
connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include access
to, the retention and (upon the other PartyÂ’s request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Partnership and Rice will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Midstream Assets relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the later of six years after the Closing Date or
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective
taxable periods (including any extensions thereof), and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority. Each of the
Partnership and Rice agrees, upon request, to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any Tax that
could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



-28- 5.8 _Distribution of Excluded Assets_. Prior to Closing, Rice will cause
each of the Vantage Midstream Entities to take all actions necessary to
distribute, assign and convey the assets, liabilities, rights and obligations
described on _Exhibit C_ (the " _Excluded Assets_ ") to an Affiliate of Rice
(other than the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries) (the " _Pre-Closing
Distribution_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Rice shall
ensure that the Pre-Closing Distribution complies with, and is
duly authorized in accordance with, Applicable Laws and each of the
applicable Organizational Documents and contracts (including restrictions
related to available cash for dividends, required capitalization and
fraudulent conveyance) and that, following the distribution, the Vantage
Midstream Entities will have no Liability with respect to the Excluded Assets.

 

5.9 _Indebtedness and Release of Liens_. Rice shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, as soon as reasonably practical but no later than the
Closing Date, (i) repay in full and discharge or otherwise obtain a release of
any obligations with respect to any Indebtedness and (ii) obtain a release of
all Liens set forth on Schedule 3.8(c); in each case, without any post-
Closing liability or expense to the Partnership _, its Subsidiaries, the_
Vantage Midstream Entities, their Subsidiaries, the Conveyed Interests _or_
_the_ _Business_ _, Rice_ shall provide proof of such payment, discharge,
satisfaction and/or release, as applicable, in full in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Partnership at the Closing.

 

5.10 _Existing Gathering Agreements_. Rice shall (i) cause the Existing
Vantage Gathering Agreements to be terminated and (ii) satisfy any and all
obligations, costs and penalties, if any, as a result of such termination.
Rice shall not, and shall use its Influence to cause each Vantage Midstream
Entity not to, enter into any other gathering agreement, dedication or
similar arrangement.

5.11 _SEC Matters_. Rice acknowledge that the Partnership may be required
to include financial statements relating to the Vantage Midstream Entities ("
_SEC Financial Statements_ ") in documents filed with the SEC by the
Partnership pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and that
such SEC Financial Statements may be required to be audited. In that regard,
Rice shall cooperate with the Partnership, and provide the Partnership access
to such records and personnel of Rice as the Partnership may reasonably
request to enable the Partnership, and its representatives and accountants,
at the PartnershipÂ’s sole cost and expense, to create and audit any SEC
Financial Statements that the Partnership deems necessary. Rice hereby
consents to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of the SEC Financial
Statements in any registration statement, report or other document of the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates to be filed with the SEC in which the
Partnership or its Affiliate reasonably determines that the SEC Financial
Statements are required to be included or incorporated by reference to satisfy
any rule or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure
obligations under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Upon request of
the Partnership, Rice shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
external audit firm that audits the SEC Financial Statements to consent to the
inclusion or incorporation by reference of its audit opinion with respect to
any applicable audited financial statements of the Partnership in any such
registration statement, report or other document and to provide customary
comfort letters as required by the PartnershipÂ’s underwriters. Rice shall
provide the Partnership and its independent accountants with access to (i)
any audit work papers of RiceÂ’s independent accountants and (ii) any
management representation letters

 



-29-  provided by Rice to RiceÂ’s independent accountants. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall expand RiceÂ’s representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or give the Partnership,
its Affiliates or any third party any rights to which it is not entitled
hereunder.

INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.1 _Indemnification of Rice and Other Parties_. From and after the
Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_ , the
Partnership shall indemnify and hold Rice and its Affiliates and their
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (together with
Rice, the " _Rice_ _Indemnitees_ ") harmless from and against any and all
damages, losses, deficiencies, costs, expenses, obligations, fines,
expenditures, claims and liabilities, including court costs and reasonable
attorneysÂ’, accountantsÂ’ or other expertsÂ’ fees and reasonable expenses of
investigation, defending and prosecuting Litigation (collectively, the "
_Damages_ "), suffered by the Rice Indemnitees as a result of, caused by,
arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) any breach, violation or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Partnership in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto (except for with
respect to _Section 3.13(a)_ , without regard to qualifications as to
materiality or Rice Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications
contained therein) or (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant under this
Agreement on the part of the Partnership.

 

8.2 _Indemnification of the Partnership and Other Parties_. From and after
the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_ ,
Rice shall indemnify and hold the General Partner, the members of the
Partnership Group and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives (together with the Partnership, the " _Partnership_
_Indemnitees_ ") harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered by the
Partnership Indemnitees as a result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any
way relating to (a) any breach, violation or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty of Rice in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant

Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications contained therein), (b)
any breach of any agreement or covenant in this Agreement on the part of
Rice, (c) the Rice Special Liabilities or (d) all Liabilities related to the
Excluded Assets and the Pre-Closing Distribution.

 

8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) Each indemnified party agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of
facts giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ by any third party with respect to any matter as to which it
claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions

 



-33-  of this Agreement, such indemnified party must assert its claim for
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (each, an " _Indemnity Claim_ ") by
providing a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party
allegedly required to provide indemnification protection under this _Article
VIII_ specifying, in reasonable detail, the nature and basis for such
Indemnity Claim ( _e.g._ , the underlying representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement alleged to have been breached). Such notice shall include a
demand for indemnification under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, an indemnified partyÂ’s failure to send or delay in sending a third
party Claim Notice will not relieve the indemnifying party from liability
hereunder with respect to such Indemnity Claim except to the extent the
indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure or delay and except as is
otherwise provided herein. Except as specifically provided herein, each
indemnified partyÂ’s rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement will
survive the Closing.

 

(b) In the event of the assertion of any third-party Indemnity Claim for
which, by the terms hereof, an indemnified party seeks indemnification from
an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will have the right, at such
indemnifying partyÂ’s expense, to assume the defense of same, including the
appointment and selection of counsel on behalf of the indemnified party so
long as such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party. If the
indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of any such third-party
Indemnity Claim, it shall within 20 Business Days of its receipt of the Claim
Notice notify the indemnified party in writing of its intent to do so. Any
such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying
party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. The indemnifying party
will have the right to settle or compromise or take any corrective or
remediation action with respect to any such Indemnity Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the indemnifying party to
a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the indemnifying party.
The indemnified party will be entitled, at its own cost, to participate with
the indemnifying party in the defense of any such Indemnity Claim. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of any such third-party Indemnity
Claim but fails to reasonably prosecute such Indemnity Claim, or if the
indemnifying party does not assume the defense of any such Indemnity Claim,
the indemnified party may assume control of such defense and in the event it
is determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Article VIII_ that
the Indemnity Claim was a matter for which the indemnifying party is required
to provide indemnification under the terms of this _Article VIII_ , the
indemnifying party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of such defense
(including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses).

 

(c) If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any
third-party Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or,
if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the
third-party Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and
the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable
expenses incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the
indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall reasonably cooperate with
the indemnified party and its counsel in contesting any third-party Indemnity
Claim.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnifying party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the indemnified party to 

 



-34-  any injunctive or other non-monetary relief or any criminal liability,
requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified
party or imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any payment from
the indemnified party without the indemnified partyÂ’s prior written consent.

 

8.4 _Calculation and Payment of Damages_.

 

(a) In calculating amounts payable to an indemnified party for a claim for
indemnification hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Damages shall be
determined without duplication of any other Damages for which an
indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and shall be computed net of
(i) payments actually recovered under any insurance policy with respect to
such Damages or (ii) any prior or subsequent actual recovery from any Person
other than the applicable indemnifying party with respect to such Damages.

 

(b) The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic
payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or
defense, within 10 days as and when reasonably specific bills are received or
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense is incurred and reasonable evidence
thereof is delivered.

 

8.5 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in no event shall any Party be liable pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ for punitive, special, indirect, consequential, remote,
speculative or lost profits damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the
form of action through which such damages are sought, except for any such
damages for fraud or recovered by any third party against an indemnified party
in respect of which such indemnified party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the terms hereof.

 

8.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) To the extent the Partnership Indemnitees are entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _8.2(a)_ , Rice shall
not be liable for those Damages unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds
one percent of the Consideration (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the
extent of any such excess; provided, however, that Rice shall not be liable
for Damages pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.2(a)_ that exceed, in the aggregate,
fifteen percent of the Consideration (the " _Cap_ ") less the Deductible.

(b) Notwithstanding clause (a) above, (i) to the extent the Partnership
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for Damages for claims arising
from fraud or Damages for Taxes arising from a breach, violation or inaccuracy
of the representations or warranties in _Section_ _ _ _3.11_ , Rice shall be
fully liable for such Damages without regard to the Deductible or the Cap and

for Damages for claims arising from a breach, violation or inaccuracy of
a Rice Fundamental Representation, Rice shall be fully liable for such
Damages without regard to the Deductible or the Cap.

 



-35- (c) To the extent the Rice Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
for Damages pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(a)_ , the Partnership shall not be
liable for those Damages unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds the
Deductible; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership shall not be liable
for Damages pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(a)_ that exceed, in the aggregate,
the Cap less the Deductible.

 

(d) Notwithstanding clause (c) above, (i) to the extent the Rice
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for Damages for claims arising
from fraud, the Partnership shall be fully liable for such Damages without
regard to the Deductible or the Cap and (ii) to the extent the Rice
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for Damages for claims arising
from a breach, violation or inaccuracy of a Partnership Fundamental
Representation, the Partnership shall be fully liable for such Damages without
regard to the Deductible or the Cap.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (x) the
Partnership obtains knowledge of the breach or violation of, or inaccuracy
with respect to, any representation or warranty of Rice under this Agreement
(regardless of whether such knowledge is obtained by inspection or
investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Partnership or its directors,
officers, employees, or representatives at any time and regardless of whether
notice of such knowledge has been given to Rice), and nonetheless proceeds to
the Closing, the Partnership shall not be deemed to have waived any rights
and remedies set forth in this Agreement with respect to such breach or
inaccuracy, or (y) Rice obtains knowledge of the breach or violation of, or
inaccuracy with respect to, any representation or warranty of the Partnership
under this Agreement (regardless of whether such knowledge is obtained by
inspection or investigation conducted by or on behalf of Rice or its
directors, officers, employees, or representatives at any time and regardless
of whether notice of such knowledge has been given to the Partnership), and
nonetheless proceeds to the Closing, Rice shall not be deemed to have waived
any rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement with respect to such
breach or inaccuracy.

 

8.7 _Survival_.

 

(a) The liability of Rice for the breach, violation or inaccuracy of any of
the representations and warranties of Rice set forth in _Sections_ _ _ _3.1_
, _3.2_ , _3.3(a)_ , _3.7_ , _3.10_ and _3.11_ (the " _Rice Fundamental

-36- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ _ _ _8.7_
, if an indemnified party delivers written notice in reasonable detail to an
indemnifying party of a claim for indemnification on or prior to the
applicable expiration date for such claim, such claim shall survive until
finally resolved.

8.8 _Mitigation_. The Parties agree that an indemnified partyÂ’s right to
recourse under this _Article VIII_ for any Damages shall be limited to the

fact, event or circumstance giving rise to such Damages.

the other Parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless the Party desiring to make such announcement or statement, after
seeking such consent from the other Parties, obtains advice from legal counsel
that such a public announcement or statement may be required by applicable
law or securities exchange regulations.

10.5 _Form of Payment_. All payments hereunder shall be made in United
States dollars and, unless the Parties making and receiving such payments
shall agree otherwise or the provisions hereof provide otherwise, shall be
made by wire or interbank transfer of immediately available funds on the date
such payment is due to such account as the Party receiving payment may
designate at least three Business Days prior to the proposed date of payment.

 

10.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits and schedules
hereto, (a) constitute the entire agreement

 



-39-  among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede
all prior oral agreements and understandings among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies hereunder except as _Article VIII_ or _Section
10.15_ contemplates or except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
therein. Each Party agrees that (i) no other Party (including its agents and
representatives) has made any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
to or with such Party relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than those expressly set forth in the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to in
_clause (_ _i_ _)_ above herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the
exhibits and schedules hereto and (ii) such Party has not relied upon any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby other than those referred to in clause
(i) above. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Parties. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the Parties to
comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement
or any Transaction Document may be waived by the Party or Parties entitled to
the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the Party or
Parties granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 

10.7 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
benefits or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Provided that the Partnership may
assign all or any of its rights and/or obligations (i) to a Subsidiary, (ii)
by way of a merger or consolidation or a sale of all or substantially all of
its assets, or (iii) pursuant to granting a Lien to financiers in a bona fide
lending transaction or in connection with any foreclosure, power of sale or
settlement thereof; provided no such assignment shall relieve the Partnership
of any of its obligations under this agreement.

 

10.8 _Severability_. If any provision of the Agreement is rendered or
declared illegal or unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently
enacted legislation or by decree of a court of last resort, the Parties shall
meet promptly and negotiate substitute provisions for those rendered or
declared illegal or unenforceable, but all of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
or impaired in any way thereby.

 

10.9 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and therefore waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the Party drafting such agreement or document.

 

(b) The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder"
and "hereof," and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular subdivision

 



-40-  unless expressly so limited. The words "this Article," "this Section" and
"this clause," and words of similar import, refer only to the Article, Section
or clause hereof in which such words occur. The word "or" is exclusive, and
the word "including" (in its various forms) means including without
limitation.

 

(c) Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to
state and include any other gender, and words, terms and titles (including
terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the
plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires.

 

(d) References herein to any Person shall include such PersonÂ’s successors
and assigns; provided, however, that nothing contained in this clause (d) is
intended to authorize any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by
this Agreement.

 

(e) References herein to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as
amended, reenacted, supplemented or superseded in whole or in part and in
effect from time to time and also to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

 

(f) References herein to any Contract mean such Contract as amended,
supplemented or modified (including any waiver thereto) in accordance with
the terms thereof.

(g) Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained in
this Agreement will have independent significance, and the fact that any
conduct or state of facts may be within the scope of two or more provisions in
this Agreement, whether relating to the same or different subject matters and
regardless of the relative levels of specificity, shall not be considered in
construing or interpreting this Agreement.

 

(h) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein to the contrary, accounting
terms shall have the meaning given by GAAP. 

10.10 _Headings and_ _Schedules_. The headings of the several Articles and
Sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The schedules referred to herein are attached hereto and
incorporated herein by this reference, and the matters disclosed in those
schedules shall be deemed to qualify the representation or warranty to which
they expressly relate and any other representation or warranty, but only to
the extent that it is readily apparent on its face that such disclosure is
applicable to such other representation or warranty. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that (a) the schedules may include certain items and information
solely for informational purposes for the convenience of the Parties and (b)
the disclosure by any Party of any matter in any schedule shall not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment by such Party that the matter is required to
be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

 

10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including electronic, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such
signature shall create a valid

 



-41-  and binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such
signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
".pdf" signature page were an original thereof.

10.12 _Determinations by the Partnership_. With respect to any notice,
consent, approval or waiver that is required to be or may be taken or given
by the Partnership (a) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on or prior to
the Closing Date or (b) pursuant to _Article VIII_ after the Closing Date,
such notice, consent, approval or waiver shall be taken or given only by the
Conflicts Committee on behalf of the Partnership.

 

10.13 _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party agrees that it has been
represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and that it
has executed the same upon the advice of such independent counsel. Each Party
and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be construed
against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the Parties waive
the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

 

10.14 _Disclosure_ _Schedules_. The inclusion of any information
(including dollar amounts) in any schedule hereto shall not be deemed to be
an admission or acknowledgment by a Party that such information is required to
be listed on such schedule or is material to or outside the ordinary course of
the business of such Party or the Person to which such disclosure relates.
The information contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits and the Schedules is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
in this Agreement, the Exhibits or the Schedules shall be deemed to be an
admission by any Party to any third Person of any matter whatsoever (including
any violation of a legal requirement or breach of contract). The disclosure
contained in any section of a disclosure schedule may be incorporated
by reference into any other disclosure schedule section contained therein,
and shall be deemed to have been so incorporated into any other disclosure
schedule section so long as it is readily apparent that the disclosure is
applicable to such other disclosure schedule.

10.15 _No Recourse_ _Against_ _Non-Parties_. All claims or causes
of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may be made
only against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties. No Person
who is not a named Party to this Agreement, including any director, officer,
employee, member, partner (general or limited), securityholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any named Party to this Agreement ("
_Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each Party hereto waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third-party
beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.
