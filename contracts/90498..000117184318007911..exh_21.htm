As an inducement for Simmons to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and certain executive officers of Reliance have
simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each a &ldquo;<u>Voting Agreement</u>&rdquo; and collectively, the &ldquo;<u>Voting
Agreements</u>&rdquo;) in connection with the Merger, in the form of <u>Exhibit A</u> hereto. The transactions described in this
Agreement are subject to the approvals of the shareholders of Reliance and applicable regulatory authorities and the satisfaction
of certain other conditions described in this Agreement. It is the intention of the Parties that the Merger for federal income
tax purposes shall qualify as a &ldquo;reorganization&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,
and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a &ldquo;plan of reorganization&rdquo; for purposes of Sections 354 and

</font><u>Systems and Processes</u>. Each of Reliance and Reliance Bank has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to ensure that material information is made known to the management of Reliance and Reliance Bank as appropriate
and provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Reliance Financial
Statements and the Call Reports for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that (i) transactions are executed only
in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Reliance
Financial Statements and the Call Reports and to maintain accountability for the Assets of Reliance and Reliance Bank, (iii) access
to such Assets is permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization, and (iv) the reporting of such Assets is
compared with existing Assets at regular intervals. The records, systems, controls, data and information of Reliance and the Reliance
Entities are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Reliance or the Reliance Subsidiaries
or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Reliance. Reliance
and Reliance Bank have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to their auditors
and the audit committee of their respective boards of directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect their ability to record, process, summarize or report financial
data and have disclosed to their auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in their internal controls. Since December 31, 2013, neither
Reliance nor Reliance Bank nor, to Reliance&rsquo; Knowledge, any employee, auditor, accountant or representative of any Reliance
Entity has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the adequacy of such systems and processes or the accuracy or integrity of Reliance Financial Statements, Call
Reports or the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves,
write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Reliance or any Reliance Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Reliance or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices. No attorney representing Reliance or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Reliance or any
of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by Reliance or any of its officers, directors or employees to the board of directors of Reliance or any committee thereof or to
any director or officer of Reliance. To Reliance&rsquo; Knowledge, there has been no instance of fraud by any Reliance Entity,
whether or not material, that occurred during any period covered by Reliance Financial Statements.</p>

owner of or has a license, with the right to sublicense, to any Intellectual Property sold or licensed to a third party by such
Reliance Entity in connection with such Reliance Entity&rsquo;s business operations, and such Reliance Entity has the right to
convey by sale or license any Intellectual Property so conveyed. No Reliance Entity is in Default under any of its Intellectual
Property licenses. No proceedings have been instituted, or are pending or to the Knowledge of Reliance threatened, which challenge
the rights of any Reliance Entity with respect to Intellectual Property used, sold or licensed by such Reliance Entity in the course

or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of such person.
The validity, continuation and effectiveness of all licenses and other agreements relating to Intellectual Property used by any
Reliance Entity in the course of its business and the current terms thereof will not be affected by the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the use of the &ldquo;Reliance Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reliance Bancshares, Inc.&rdquo; trademarks will be transferred

an entity, including the name of the individuals employed by or providing service on behalf of such entity) and contact information

Entities in excess of $10,000 or that has a Contract with any Reliance Entity with a term in excess of six months (collectively,
&ldquo;<u>Contractors</u>&rdquo;) used by the Reliance Entities at any point during the prior three years. A copy of each Contract
relating to the services a Contractor provides to the Reliance Entities has been made available to Simmons prior to the date hereof.
To Reliance&rsquo;s Knowledge, no Contractor used by the Reliance Entities is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any agreement
or arrangement with any third party, including any confidentiality or non-competition agreement, that in any way adversely affects
or restricts the performance of such Contractor&rsquo;s duties for the Reliance Entities. To Reliance&rsquo;s Knowledge, no current
Contractor used by the Reliance Entities intends to terminate his or her or its relationship with any Reliance Entity. The Reliance
Entities have no obligation or liability with respect to any taxes (or the withholding thereof) in connection with any Contractor
nor has Reliance performed any act or engaged in any activity that could result in Reliance being found to be a joint employer
of a Contractor under the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, any Occupational Safety and Health Administration
laws or regulations, any state worker&rsquo;s compensation laws, or any other law or regulation. The Reliance Entities have properly
classified, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and any other applicable Law, all Contractors used by the Reliance Entities at
any point.</p>

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the Parties waives any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate.</p>
