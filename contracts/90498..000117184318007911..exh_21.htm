AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of November 13, 2018, by and between Simmons First National
Corporation (" _Simmons_ "), an Arkansas corporation, and Reliance Bancshares,
Inc. (" _Reliance_ "), a Missouri corporation.

  

  

Preamble

  

  

The respective boards of directors of Reliance and Simmons have approved this
Agreement and declared that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Parties
and their respective shareholders. This Agreement provides for
the acquisition of Reliance by Simmons pursuant to the merger of Reliance
with and into Simmons with Simmons as the surviving corporation. At the
effective time of such Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock of
Reliance shall be converted into the right to receive a fixed amount of cash
and a fixed number of shares of common stock of Simmons, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein. As an inducement for Simmons to enter into
this Agreement, each of the directors and certain executive officers of
Reliance have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each a
" _Voting Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") in
connection with the Merger, in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto. The
transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the approvals of the
shareholders of Reliance and applicable regulatory authorities and the
satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement. It is
the intention of the Parties that the Merger for federal income tax purposes
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is
adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

  

  

The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe to
certain conditions to the Merger.

  

  

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are
defined in Sections 2.11 and 10.1 of this Agreement.

  

  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the above and the mutual
warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the
Parties agree as follows:

The General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri (the " _GBCL_ ")
with the effects set forth in the ABCA and the GBCL (the " _Merger_ ").
Simmons shall be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger, and
shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Reliance in
accordance with the ABCA. Upon consummation of the Merger the separate
corporate existence of Reliance shall terminate.

  

  

1.2.  Time and Place of Closing.

  

  

The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 A.M., Central Time, on the date that the Effective Time
occurs, or at such other date and time as the Parties, acting through their
authorized officers, may mutually agree in writing. The Closing shall be held

terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing
by the authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall cause the
Effective Time to occur by the later of (i) April 23, 2019 or (ii) a date
within 30 days following satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law)
of the last to occur of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Effective Time) as reasonably determined by Simmons. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

cause Simmons Bank to approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger, Simmons as the
sole stockholder of Simmons Bank, shall approve the Subsidiary Plan of Merger
and Simmons shall cause Simmons Bank to duly execute and deliver the

shall cause Reliance Bank, and Simmons shall cause Simmons Bank, to execute
and file such articles of merger, required merger certificates, and such other

ARTICLE 2 
 MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

  

  

2.1.  Conversion of Shares.

  

  

Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE 2, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Simmons, Reliance or
the shareholders of either of the foregoing, the shares of Reliance and
Simmons shall be converted as follows:

  

  

(a)  Each share of capital stock of Simmons issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
from and after the Effective Time.

  

  

(b)  Each share of issued Reliance Common Stock that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, is held by Reliance, any wholly owned Reliance
Subsidiary, by Simmons or any Simmons Subsidiary (in each case other than
shares held in any Employee Benefit Plans or related trust accounts or
otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) (collectively, the " _Canceled Shares_ ") shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c)  Each share of Reliance Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding the Canceled Shares and the Reliance
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive, without
interest:

  

  

(i)  the Per Share Cash Consideration; and

  

  

(ii)  the Per Share Stock Consideration (together with the Per Share Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  

  

(d)  Each share of Reliance Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry
share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") registered in the transfer books of Reliance
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Reliance
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Reliance
Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with ARTICLE 3, including the right, if any, to receive pursuant to
Section 2.6, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Simmons Common Stock into
which such shares of Reliance Common Stock have been converted together with
the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 3.1(d).

  

  

2.2.  Anti-Dilution Provisions.

  

  

Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and subject to
Sections 6.2(d) and 6.2(e), if at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding
shares of Reliance Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of Reliance Common Stock or the issued and
outstanding shares of Simmons Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Simmons Common Stock, shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, reorganization, recapitalization,
redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar
transaction, then, the Stock Consideration shall be equitably and
proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect
fully the effect of any such change; provided, that nothing in this Section
2.2 shall be considered to permit any Party to take any action with respect
to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  

   

6

 

    

  

2.3.  Treatment of Reliance Equity Rights.

  

  

(a)  At the Effective Time, each option granted by Reliance to purchase
shares of Reliance Common Stock under a Reliance Stock Plan, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Reliance Stock Option_ ") shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from Simmons a cash payment ("
_Reliance Stock Option Payout_ ") equal to the applicable Reliance Stock
Option Amount. Any Reliance Stock Option with an Option Exercise Price that
equals or exceeds the Fully Diluted Per Share Value shall be canceled with no
consideration being paid to the optionholder with respect to such Reliance
Stock Option. Simmons shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any Reliance Stock Option Payout
all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal
Revenue Code or any provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign Tax law;
provided, that Simmons shall not deduct or withhold from the Reliance Stock
Option Payout of either Brouster and Associates, LLC or Dittrich Company (or
their Affiliates) nor otherwise take a position in its tax returns
inconsistent with that certain tax letter from CliftonLarsonAllen LLP to
Reliance dated as of November 9, 2018.

  

  

(b)  At the Effective Time, each warrant granted by Reliance to purchase
shares of Reliance Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Reliance Warrant_ ") shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from Simmons a cash payment
(" _Reliance Warrant Payout_ ") equal to the applicable Reliance Warrant
Amount. Any Reliance Warrant with a Warrant Exercise Price that equals or
exceeds the Fully Diluted Per Share Value shall be canceled with no
consideration being paid to the warrantholder with respect to such Reliance
Warrant. Simmons shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any Reliance Warrant Payout all
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal
Revenue Code or any provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign Tax law;
provided, that Simmons shall not deduct or withhold from the Reliance Warrant
Payout of either Brouster and Associates, LLC or Dittrich Company (or their
Affiliates) nor otherwise take a position in its tax returns inconsistent with
that certain tax letter from CliftonLarsonAllen LLP to Reliance dated as of
November 9, 2018.

  

  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Reliance, the board of directors of
Reliance or any committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions, and cause any actions to be taken, that are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3.

  

  

2.4.  Treatment of Reliance Savings Plan.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time, each share of Reliance
Common Stock held in the Reliance Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("
_Reliance Savings Plan_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c).

  

  

2.5.  Shares Held by Reliance or Simmons.

  

  

Each Canceled Share shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be issued or delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

   

7

 

    

  

2.6.  Fractional Shares.

  

  

No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of
Simmons Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Simmons
shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share
interests, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Simmons. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Reliance Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Simmons
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment
rounded up to the nearest cent (without interest), which payment shall be
determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Simmons Common Stock
that such holder of shares of Reliance Common Stock would otherwise have been
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) by (ii) the Average Closing
Price.

  

  

2.7.  Treatment of Series A Preferred Stock.

  

  

At the Effective Time, each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive one share of series A preferred stock of Simmons ("
_Simmons Series A Preferred Stock_ "), which shall have such rights,
preference, privileges, and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions
thereof, which, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock than the rights, preferences, privileges,
and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series A
Preferred Stock that are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
taken as a whole. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Series A Preferred Stock other than the right to
receive the Simmons Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with this
Section 2.7.

  

  

  

2.8.  Treatment of Series B Preferred Stock.

  

  

At the Effective Time, each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive one share of series B preferred stock of Simmons
("Simmons Series B Preferred Stock"), which shall have such rights,
preference, privileges, and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions
thereof, which, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the
holders of Series B Preferred Stock than the rights, preferences, privileges,
and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series B
Preferred Stock that are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
taken as a whole. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Series B Preferred Stock other than the right to
receive the Simmons Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with this Section
2.8.

  

  

  

2.9.  Treatment of Series C Preferred Stock.

  

  

(a)  At the Effective Time, each share of Series C Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive one share of series C preferred stock of Simmons
("Simmons Series C Preferred Stock"), which shall have such rights,
preference, privileges, and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions
thereof, which, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the
holders of Series C Preferred Stock than the rights, preferences, privileges,
and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series C
Preferred Stock that are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
taken as a whole. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Series C Preferred Stock other than the right to
receive the Simmons Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with this
Section 2.9.

  

   

8

 

    

  

(b)  Reliance and Simmons acknowledge that each share of Series C Preferred
Stock is convertible to Reliance Common Stock at the option of the holder and
in accordance with the terms of the Series C Designation.

  

  

(c)  For any share of Series C Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Subject Share_ "), the Merger
Consideration that would have been payable if such share had been converted to
Reliance Common Stock shall be withheld by Simmons and Simmons shall make
arrangements such that:

  

  

(i)  upon conversion of a share of Simmons Series C Preferred Stock, the
holder of such share shall be entitled to the Merger Consideration withheld
by Simmons for the Subject Share that the converted Simmons Series C Preferred
Stock replaced; and

  

  

(ii)  if a share of Simmons Series C Preferred Stock is redeemed before it is
converted, the Merger Consideration withheld by Simmons for the Subject Share
that the redeemed Simmons Series C Preferred Stock replaced shall be canceled,
and Simmons shall pay the applicable redemption price to the holder of such
share.

  

  

2.10.  Pricing Adjustments.

  

  

(a)  If, as of the Determination Date, both of the following conditions are
satisfied:

  

  

(i)   the Average Closing Price is greater than $37.68; and

  

  

(ii)   the difference between (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
Average Closing Price by (2) $31.40 and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing
(1) the average of the closing price of the Nasdaq Bank Index (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another alternative
source as chosen by Simmons) for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on
and including the 10th trading day preceding the Closing Date by (2)
4,247.094, is greater than 0.20 (or 20%),

  

  

then the Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount in cash
so that, as a result of such adjustment, the sum of (i) the Aggregate Cash
Consideration and (ii) the Stock Consideration multiplied by the Average
Closing Price shall be no less than the Maximum Merger Consideration. "
_Maximum Merger Consideration_ " shall be the sum of (i) the product of (x)
$37.68 and (y) the Stock Consideration and (ii) the Aggregate Cash
Consideration.

  

  

  

(b)  In lieu of the adjustment described in paragraph (a) of this section,
Simmons may make such other adjustments to the Aggregate Cash Consideration
and the Stock Consideration as it deems appropriate, so long as, following
such adjustments, the sum of (i) the Aggregate Cash Consideration and (ii)
the Stock Consideration multiplied by the Average Closing Price shall be no
less than the Maximum Merger Consideration.

  

  

2.11.  Definitions.

  

  

Except as otherwise provided herein, the capitalized terms set forth below
shall have the followings meanings:

  

   

9

(b)   _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share notice advising such holders of
the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to

Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein.
Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 3.1, each Certificate, Book-Entry Share theretofore representing
shares of Reliance Common Stock (other than the Canceled Shares), and each
share of Series A Preferred Stock, share of Series B Preferred Stock, and

represent for all purposes only the right to receive the

distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been
declared or made by Reliance in respect of such shares of Reliance Common

for any reason shall be canceled and exchanged for Simmons Series A Preferred
Stock, Simmons Series B Preferred Stock and Simmons Series C Preferred Stock,

Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this Agreement until the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss and other
documentation required by the Surviving Corporation hereunder in lieu thereof)
there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of Simmons
Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such whole shares
of Simmons Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a

and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Simmons Common Stock.

  

  

(e)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former Holders, and any shares of Simmons Series
A Preferred Stock, Simmons Series B Preferred Stock and Simmons Series C
Preferred Stock which remains undistributed to the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock, share of Series B Preferred Stock, and share of Series C
Preferred Stock on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Simmons, and any former Holders who have not theretofore received
any Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any applicable dividends or other distributions with respect to Simmons Common
Stock) and any holders of Series A Preferred Stock, share of Series B
Preferred Stock, and share of Series C Preferred Stock to which they are
entitled under this ARTICLE 3 shall thereafter look only to Simmons and the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

  

  

(f)   _No Liability_. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Regulatory Authority), any such Merger Consideration in
respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Simmons, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto or their successors, assigns, or personal
representatives. None of Simmons, Reliance, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any
of them, shall be liable to any Holder in respect of any cash that would have
otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

   

13

 

    

  

(g)   _Withholding Rights_. Each and any of Simmons, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration, Simmons Series A Preferred Stock,
Simmons Series B Preferred Stock and Simmons Series C Preferred Stock and any
other amounts or property otherwise payable or distributable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts or property (or portions thereof) as
Simmons, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or distribution
under the Internal Revenue Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Regulatory
Authority by Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

  

  

(h)   _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate, or any certificate
representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock (each a " _Preferred Certificate_ ") shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate or Preferred Certificate, as
applicable, to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate or
Preferred Certificate, as applicable, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration (or, in the case of a Preferred Certificate, the
applicable series of Simmons Preferred Stock) to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE 3.

  

  

(i)   _Change in Name on Certificate_. If any Simmons Certificate
representing shares of Simmons Common Stock is to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
Simmons Certificate representing shares of Simmons Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable **.**

  

  

3.2.  Dissenting Shareholders.

  

  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Reliance Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to

and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Reliance Common Stock
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
351.455 of the GBCL (" _Section 351.455_ ") (the " _Reliance Dissenting
Shareholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive any of the consideration as specified in ARTICLE 2 (the "
_Reliance Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such Holder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such Reliance Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 351.455. At the Effective Time, all Reliance
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Holder of Reliance
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Reliance Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 351.455. Notwithstanding the

withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 351.455, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 351.455, then the right of such Holder to be
paid the fair value of such Holder's Reliance Dissenting Shares under Section
351.455 shall cease and such Reliance Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c) of
this Agreement, any cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any) pursuant to
Section 2.6 and any dividends or distributions (if any) pursuant to Section
3.1(d).

(b)  Reliance shall give Simmons prompt written notice (but in any event

Reliance Common Stock and any withdrawals of such demands, and Simmons shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Reliance shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Simmons, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.

any jurisdiction, and any related or similar rules, regulations or
guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by any Regulatory Authority
(collectively, the " _Money Laundering Laws_ ") and no action, suit or
proceeding by or before any Regulatory Authority or any arbitrator
involving any Reliance Entity with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Reliance, threatened. Each Reliance Entity
has been conducting operations at all times in compliance with applicable
financial recordkeeping and reporting requirements of all Money Laundering
Laws administered and each Reliance Entity has established and maintained a
system of internal controls designed to ensure compliance by the Reliance
Entities with applicable financial recordkeeping and reporting requirements of
the Money Laundering Laws.

  

  

4.18.  Labor Relations.

  

  

(a)  No Reliance Entity is the subject of any pending or threatened
Litigation asserting that it or any other Reliance Entity has committed an
unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act
or comparable state Law) or other violation of state or federal labor Law or
seeking to compel it or any other Reliance Entity to bargain with any labor
organization or other employee representative as to wages or conditions of
employment, nor is any Reliance Entity party to or currently negotiating any
collective bargaining agreement or subject to any bargaining order, injunction
or other Order relating to Reliance's relationship or dealings with its
employees, any labor organization or any other employee representative. There
is no strike, slowdown, lockout or other job action or labor dispute
involving any Reliance Entity pending or threatened and there have been no
such actions or disputes since December 31, 2013. To the Knowledge of
Reliance, since December 31, 2013, there has not been any attempt by
any Reliance Entity employees or any labor organization or other employee
representative to organize or certify a collective bargaining unit or to
engage in any other union organization activity with respect to the workforce
of any Reliance Entity. The employment of each employee and the engagement of
each independent contractor of Reliance Entity are terminable at will by the
relevant Reliance Entity without any penalty, liability or severance
obligation incurred by any Reliance Entity except for those agreements or
obligations listed in Section 4.19(i) of Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum.

  

  

(b)  Section 4.18(b) of Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum separately sets
forth, as of October 31, 2018, all of Reliance's employees, including for
each such employee: name, job title, Fair Labor Standards Act designation,
work location (identified by street address), current compensation paid or
payable, all wage arrangements, fringe benefits (other than employee benefits
applicable to all employees, which benefits are set forth on Section 4.19(a)
of Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum), bonuses paid the past three years, and
visa and greencard application status. To Reliance's Knowledge, no employee of
any Reliance Entity is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any agreement or
arrangement, including any confidentiality or non-competition agreement, that
in any way adversely affects or restricts the performance of such employee's
duties. Each current and former employee of the Reliance Entities who has
contributed to the creation or development of any Intellectual Property owned
by any Reliance Entity has executed a nondisclosure and assignment-of-rights
agreement for the benefit of the Reliance Entities vesting all rights in work
product created by the employee during the employee's employment or
affiliation with the Reliance Entities. No employee of any Reliance Entity
who has annual base compensation above $75,000 has provided written notice to
a Reliance Entity of his or her intent to terminate his or her employment
with the applicable Reliance Entity as of the date hereof, and, as of the date
hereof, to Reliance's Knowledge, no employee who has annual base compensation
above $75,000 intends to terminate his or her employment with Reliance before
Closing.

  

   

26

 

    

  

(c)  Section 4.18(c) of Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum contains a complete
and accurate listing of the name (if an entity, including the name of the
individuals employed by or providing service on behalf of such entity) and
contact information of each independent contractor, consultant, freelancer or
other professional service provider that receives annual fees from
Reliance Entities in excess of $10,000 or that has a Contract with any
Reliance Entity with a term in excess of six months (collectively, "
_Contractors_ ") used by the Reliance Entities at any point during the prior
three years. A copy of each Contract relating to the services a Contractor
provides to the Reliance Entities has been made available to Simmons prior to
the date hereof. To Reliance's Knowledge, no Contractor used by the Reliance
Entities is a party to, or is otherwise bound by, any agreement or
arrangement with any third party, including any confidentiality or non-
competition agreement, that in any way adversely affects or restricts the
performance of such Contractor's duties for the Reliance Entities. To
Reliance's Knowledge, no current Contractor used by the Reliance Entities
intends to terminate his or her or its relationship with any Reliance Entity.
The Reliance Entities have no obligation or liability with respect to any
taxes (or the withholding thereof) in connection with any Contractor nor has
Reliance performed any act or engaged in any activity that could result in
Reliance being found to be a joint employer of a Contractor under the
National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, any Occupational
Safety and Health Administration laws or regulations, any state worker's
compensation laws, or any other law or regulation. The Reliance Entities have
properly classified, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and any other
applicable Law, all Contractors used by the Reliance Entities at any point.

  

  

(d)  The Reliance Entities have no "leased employees" within the meaning of
Internal Revenue Code § 414(n).

  

  

(e)  The Reliance Entities have, or will have no later than the Closing Date,
paid all accrued salaries, bonuses, commissions, and other wages due to be
paid through the Closing Date. Each of the Reliance Entities is and at all
times has been in material compliance with all Law governing the employment
of labor and the withholding of taxes, including but not limited to, all
contractual commitments and all such Laws relating to wages, hours,
affirmative action, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil
rights, safety and health, workers' compensation and the collection and
payment of withholding and/or Social Security taxes and similar taxes.

  

  

(f)  There have not been any wage and hour claims by any employee of any
Reliance Entity since December 31, 2013, nor, to Reliance's Knowledge, are
there any wage and hour claims currently threatened by any employee of any
Reliance Entity. Except for claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course under
a Reliance Benefit Plan, there have not been any proceedings by any employee
of any Reliance Entity related to their employment with such Reliance Entity
since December 31, 2013, nor, to the Knowledge of Reliance, are there any
proceedings currently threatened by any employee of any Reliance Entity
related to their employment with such Reliance Entity. Nor, to the Knowledge
of Reliance, are there any governmental investigations open with or under
consideration by the Department of Labor, Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs or any other
governmental body charged with administering or enforcing employment related
laws or regulations.

  

   

27

 

    

  

(g)  All of the Reliance Entities' employees are employed in the United
States and are either United States citizens or are legally entitled to work
in the United States under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as
amended, other United States immigration Laws and the Laws related to the
employment of non-United States citizens applicable in the state in which
the employees are employed. Each individual who renders services to any
Reliance Entity has provided proof of employment eligibility and is properly
classified as having the status of an employee or independent contractor or
other non-employee status (including for purposes of taxation and Tax
reporting and under Reliance Benefit Plans).

  

  

4.19.  Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a)  Reliance has made available to Simmons prior to the execution of this
Agreement, true and correct copies of each Employee Benefit Plan currently
adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by
any Reliance Entity or ERISA Affiliate thereof for the benefit of employees,
retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or other
beneficiaries or under which employees, retirees, former employees,
dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or other
beneficiaries are eligible to participate or with respect to which Reliance
or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any obligation or
Liability (collectively, the " _Reliance Benefit Plans_ "). Any of the
Reliance Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as that
term is defined in ERISA Section 3(2), is referred to herein as a " _Reliance
ERISA Plan_." Section 4.19(a) of Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum has a
complete and accurate list of all Reliance Benefit Plans. No Reliance Benefit
Plan is subject to any Laws other than those of the United States or any
state, county, or municipality in the United States. Reliance has made
available to Simmons prior to the execution of this Agreement (i) all trust
agreements or other funding arrangements for all Reliance Benefit Plans, (ii)
all determination letters, opinion letters, information letters or advisory
opinions issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), the
United States Department of Labor (" _DOL_ ") or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") regarding a Reliance Benefit Plan during this
calendar year or any of the preceding three calendar years, or the most recent
such letter or opinion if issued prior to the three preceding calendar years,
(iii) annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial
statements, actuarial or allocation reports, non-discrimination tests and
valuations prepared for any Reliance Benefit Plan for the current plan year
and the preceding three plan years, (iv) the most recent summary plan
descriptions and any material modifications thereto for any Reliance Benefit
Plan, (v) any material correspondence with the DOL, IRS, PBGC, or any other
governmental entity regarding a Reliance Benefit Plan within the preceding
three-year period (vi) any correspondence, memorandum or calculations
regarding errors corrected or to be corrected with respect to any Reliance
Benefit Plan under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the
DOL Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program within the preceding three-year
period and (vii) the most recent actuarial valuations of Reliance Benefit
Plans.

  

  

(b)  Each Reliance Benefit Plan is and has been maintained in compliance in
all material respects with the terms of such Reliance Benefit Plan, and in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code, ERISA, and any other applicable Laws. No Reliance
Benefit Plan is required to be amended within the ninety-day period beginning
on the Closing Date in order to continue to comply with ERISA, the Internal
Revenue Code, and other applicable Law. Each Reliance Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is
so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter, or for a
prototype or volume submitter plan, opinion letter, from the IRS that is still
in effect and applies to the Reliance Benefit Plan and on which such Reliance
Benefit Plan is entitled to rely. Nothing has occurred and no
circumstance exists that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of such Reliance Benefit Plan.

  

   

28

 

    

  

(c)  There are no threatened or pending claims or disputes under the terms
of, or in connection with, the Reliance Benefit Plans other than claims for
benefits in the Ordinary Course and no action, proceeding, prosecution,
inquiry, hearing or investigation has been commenced with respect to any
Reliance Benefit Plan.

  

  

(d)  Neither Reliance nor any Affiliate of Reliance has engaged in any
prohibited transaction for which there is not an exemption, within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to
any Reliance Benefit Plan and no prohibited transaction has occurred with
respect to any Reliance Benefit Plan that would be reasonably expected to
result in any liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue
Code. Neither Reliance, any Reliance Entity, any Reliance Entity employee,
nor any committee of which any Reliance Entity employee is a member has
breached his or her fiduciary duty with respect to a Reliance Benefit Plan in
connection with any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the
administration or investment of the assets of any Reliance Benefit Plan. To
Reliance's Knowledge, no fiduciary, within the meaning of Section 3(21) of
ERISA, who is not Reliance or any Reliance Entity employee, has breached his
or her fiduciary duty with respect to a Reliance Benefit Plan or otherwise
has any liability in connection with any acts taken (or failed to be taken)
with respect to the administration or investment of the assets of any
Reliance Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any
liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code being
imposed on Reliance or any Affiliate of Reliance.

  

  

(e)  Neither Reliance nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time been a party to
or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has been obligated to contribute
to, or had any liability with respect to (i) any plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, including a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)
and 4001(a)(3)), (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of ERISA
or the Internal Revenue Code), (iii) any voluntary employees' beneficiary
association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code), (iv) an arrangement that is not either exempt from, or in compliance
with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or that provides for
indemnification for or gross-up of any taxes thereunder, or (v) a self-
funded health or welfare benefit plan.

  

  

(f)  Each Reliance Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare plan has been
amended and administered in accordance with the requirements of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.

  

  

(g)  No Reliance Entity has any Liability or obligation to provide
postretirement health, medical or life insurance benefits to any Reliance
Entity's employees or former employees, officers, or directors, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under state or
federal benefits continuation Laws and for which the covered individual pays
the full cost of coverage. No Tax under Internal Revenue Code Sections 4980B
or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any Reliance Benefit Plan and no
circumstance exists which could give rise to such Tax.

  

  

(h)  All contributions required to be made to any Reliance Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Reliance Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the books and records of Reliance.

  

   

29

 

    

  

(i)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of
any Reliance Entity, or result in any (a) requirement to fund any benefits or
set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust) or (b) limitation on
the right of any Reliance Entity to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Reliance Benefit Plan or related trust. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether
in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Reliance Entities in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 4.19(i) of Reliance's
Disclosure Memorandum sets forth accurate and complete data with respect to
each individual who has a contractual right to severance pay or benefits
triggered by a change in control and the amounts potentially payable to each
such individual in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either
alone or in conjunction with any other event) or as a result of a termination
of employment or service, taking into account any contractual provisions
relating to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. No Reliance Benefit
Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999
or 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise.

  

  

(j)  The Reliance Entities have complied, in all material respects, and will
be in material compliance, as of the Closing Date, with Sections 111 and 302
of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the U.S.
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including all guidance issued
thereunder by a Regulatory Authority (collectively " _EESA_ "). Each employee
of a Reliance Entity who is subject to the limitations imposed under EESA has
executed a waiver of claims against the Reliance Entities with respect to
limiting or reducing rights to compensation, including severance payments and
benefits, for so long as the EESA limitations are required to be imposed.

  

  

4.20.  Material Contracts.

  

  

None of the Reliance Entities, nor any of their respective Assets,
businesses, or operations, is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or
receives benefits under, any Contract (whether written or oral), (a) that is
either material to any Reliance Entity or that would be required to be filed
as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by any Reliance Entity with the SEC if the
Reliance Entity were required to file or voluntarily filed such Form 10-K,

of $10,000, (d) which prohibits or restricts any Reliance Entity (and/or,
following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Simmons) from engaging in any business activities in any geographic area,
line of business or otherwise in competition with any other Person, (e)
relating to the purchase or sale of any goods or services by a Reliance
Entity (other than Contracts entered into in the Ordinary Course and involving
payments under any individual Contract not in excess of $50,000 over its
remaining term or involving Loans, borrowings or guarantees originated or
purchased by any Reliance Entity in the Ordinary Course), (f) which obligates
any Reliance Entity to conduct business with any third party on an exclusive
or preferential basis, or requires referrals of business or any Reliance
Entity to make available investment opportunities to any Person on a priority
or exclusive basis, (g) which limits the payment of dividends by any Reliance
Entity, (h) pursuant to which any Reliance Entity has agreed with any third
parties to become a member of, manage or control a joint venture,
partnership, limited liability company or other similar entity, (i) pursuant
to which any Reliance Entity has agreed with any third party to a change of
control transaction such as an acquisition, divestiture or merger or contains
a put, call or similar right involving the purchase or sale of any equity
interests or Assets of any Person and which contains representations,
covenants, indemnities or other obligations (including indemnification,
"earn-out" or other contingent obligations) that are still in effect, (j)
which relates to Intellectual Property of Reliance (excluding commercially
available "off the shelf" software programs licensed pursuant to "shrink
wrap" or "click and accept" licenses), (k) between any Reliance Entity,
on the one hand, and (i) any officer or director of any Reliance Entity, or
(ii) to the Knowledge of Reliance, any (x) record or beneficial owner of five
percent or more of the voting securities of Reliance, (y) Affiliate or family
member of any such officer, director or record or beneficial owner or (z) any
other Affiliate of Reliance, on the other hand, except those of a type
available to employees of Reliance generally, (l) that provides for payments
to be made by Reliance or any of its Subsidiaries upon a change in
control thereof, (m) that may not be canceled by Simmons, Reliance or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (i) at their convenience (subject to no more
than 90 days' prior written notice), or (ii) without payment of a penalty or
termination fee equal to or greater than $50,000 (assuming such Contract was
terminated on the Closing Date), (n) containing any standstill or similar
agreement pursuant to which Reliance has agreed not to acquire Assets or
equity interests of another Person, (o) that provides for indemnification by
Reliance or any of its Subsidiaries of any Person, except for non-material
Contracts entered into in the Ordinary Course, (p) with or to a labor union
or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement), (q) that grants any
"most favored nation" right, right of first refusal, right of first offer or

or be accelerated, in each case as a result of the Merger or the announcement
or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events), or (s) any
other Contract or amendment thereto that is material to any Reliance Entity or
their respective business or Assets and not otherwise entered into in the
Ordinary Course. Each Contract of the type described in this Section 4.20,
whether or not set forth in Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum together with
all Contracts referred to in Sections 4.13 and 4.19(a), are referred
to herein as the " _Reliance Contracts_." With respect to each Reliance
Contract: (i) the Reliance Contract is legal, valid and binding on Reliance
or a Reliance Subsidiary and is in full force and effect and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms; (ii) no Reliance Entity is in Default thereunder;
(iii) no Reliance Entity has repudiated or waived any material provision of
any such Reliance Contract; (iv) no other party to any such Reliance Contract
is, to the Knowledge of Reliance, in Default or has repudiated or waived any
material provision thereunder; and (v) there is not pending or, to the
Knowledge of Reliance, threatened cancellations of any Reliance Contract prior
to the expiration of the term thereof. All of the Reliance Contracts have
been Previously Disclosed and complete and correct copies of each
Reliance Contract have been made available to Simmons. All of the
indebtedness of any Reliance Entity for money borrowed is prepayable at any
time by such Reliance Entity without penalty or premium.

4.21.  Agreements with Regulatory Authorities.

  

  

Neither Reliance nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-

not set forth in Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum, a " _Reliance
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Reliance or any Reliance Subsidiary been
advised in writing or, to Reliance's Knowledge, orally, since December 31,
2013, by any Regulatory Authority that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such Reliance Regulatory Agreement.

  

   

31

 

    

  

4.22.  Investment Securities.

  

  

(a)  Each of Reliance and its Subsidiaries has good title in all material
respects to all securities and commodities owned by it (except those sold
under repurchase agreements, pledged to secure deposits of public funds,
borrowings of federal funds or advances and loans from the Federal Reserve
Banks or Federal Home Loan Banks or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity),
free and clear of any Lien, except to the extent such securities or

prudent banking practices to secure obligations of Reliance or its
Subsidiaries. Such securities are valued on the books of Reliance
in accordance with GAAP in all material respects.

  

  

(b)  Reliance and its Subsidiaries employ, to the extent applicable,

legal, valid and binding obligations of the Reliance Entity party thereto
and, to the Knowledge of Reliance, each of the counterparties thereto and (c)

will, when supplied or when the Registration Statement becomes effective (or
when incorporated by reference), be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. The portions of the Registration Statement

portions within the reasonable control of Reliance and its Subsidiaries will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Reliance Entity or any Affiliate thereof with any Regulatory Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will, at the respective
time such information is supplied and such documents are filed (or when
incorporated by reference), and with respect to the Proxy Statement, when
first mailed to the shareholders of Reliance, be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to

Regulatory Approvals.

  

   

33

under the terms of which the obligor was, as of October 31, 2018, over 90
days or more delinquent in payment of principal or interest. Except as such
disclosure may be limited by any applicable Law, Section 4.29(a) of
Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true, correct and complete list
of (i) all of the Loans of Reliance and its Subsidiaries that, (A) as of
September 30, 2018 had an outstanding balance of $50,000 or more and were (1)
on non-accrual status or (2) classified by Reliance as "Other Loans Specially
Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss,"
"Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch
List" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount of and
accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the aggregate
principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans as of such
date, (B) with respect to which, at any point since December 31, 2013,
constituted a "Troubled Debt Restructuring," as defined in the Accounting
Standards Codification Subtopic 310-40.

  

  

(b)  Each Loan _currently outstanding_ (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements
or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they
purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid Liens
which have been perfected and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding may be brought). The notes or other
credit or security documents with respect to each such outstanding Loan were
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of
origination or purchase by a Reliance Entity and are complete and correct in
all material respects.

  

  

(c)  Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale to investors) was
solicited and originated, and is and has been administered and, where
applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are being maintained, in all
material respects in accordance with the relevant notes or other credit or
security documents, Reliance's written underwriting standards (and, in the
case of Loans held for resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if
any, of the applicable investors) and with all applicable requirements of
Laws.

  

  

(d)  None of the Contracts pursuant to which any Reliance Entity has sold
Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans contains
any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account
of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan. Except as would not be
material to Reliance and its Subsidiaries, each Loan included in a pool of
Loans originated, securitized or, to the Knowledge of Reliance, acquired by
Reliance or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Pool_ ") meets all eligibility
requirements (including all applicable requirements for obtaining mortgage
insurance certificates and Loan guaranty certificates) for inclusion in such
Pool. All such Pools have been finally certified or, if required, recertified
in accordance with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations, except where
the time for certification or recertification has not yet expired. No Pools
have been improperly certified, and, except as would not be material to
Reliance and its Subsidiaries, no Loan has been bought out of a Pool without
all required approvals of the applicable investors.

  

  

(e)  (i) Section 4.29(e) of Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a
list of all Loans as of the date hereof by Reliance to any directors,
executive officers and principal shareholders (as such terms are defined in
Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board (12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of any
Reliance Entity, (ii) there are no employee, officer, director, principal
shareholder or other affiliate Loans on which the borrower is paying a rate
other than that reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security
agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which was not in
compliance with Regulation O and (iii) all such Loans are and were originated
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

  

   

34

 

    

  

(f)  Neither Reliance nor any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it ever been
since December 31, 2013, subject to any material fine, suspension, settlement
or other contract or other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any
reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any Regulatory Agency
relating to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans.

  

  

4.30.  Deposits.

  

  

All of the deposits held by Reliance Bank (including the records and
documentation pertaining to such deposits) have been established and are
held in compliance in all material respects with (a) all applicable policies,
practices and procedures of Reliance Bank and (b) all applicable Laws,
including Money Laundering Laws and anti-terrorism or embargoed persons
requirements. All of the deposits held by Reliance Bank are insured to the
maximum limit set by the FDIC, and the FDIC premium and all assessments have
been fully paid, and no proceedings for the termination or revocation of such
insurance are pending, or, to the Knowledge of Reliance, threatened.

  

  

4.31.  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.

  

  

The allowance for loan and lease losses (" _ALLL_ ") reflected in the
Reliance Financial Statements was, as of the date of each of the Reliance
Financial Statements, in the opinion of management of Reliance, in compliance
with Reliance's existing methodology for determining the adequacy of its ALLL
and in compliance in all material respects with the standards established by
the applicable Regulatory Authority, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
and GAAP, and was adequate.

  

  

4.32.  Insurance.

  

  

Reliance Entities are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and
in such amounts as the management of Reliance reasonably has determined to be
prudent and consistent with industry practice. Section 4.32 of Reliance's
Disclosure Memorandum contains a true, correct and complete list and a brief
description (including the name of the insurer, agent, coverage and the
expiration date) of all insurance policies in force on the date hereof with
respect to the business and Assets of the Reliance Entities, correct and
complete copies of which policies have been provided to Simmons prior to the
date hereof. The Reliance Entities are in material compliance with their
insurance policies, are not in Default under any of the material terms thereof
and, except as provided in Section 4.32 of Reliance's Disclosure Memorandum,
have filed all available claims thereunder arising during the last three
years. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of the Reliance Entities, Reliance or Reliance Bank is
the sole beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due
under any such policy have been paid, and all material claims thereunder have
been filed in due and timely fashion. To Reliance's Knowledge, no Reliance
Entity has received any written notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any
such policies, nor, to Reliance's Knowledge, is the termination of any such
policies threatened.

  

  

4.33.  OFAC; Sanctions.

  

  

None of Reliance, any Reliance Entity or any director or officer or, to the
Knowledge of Reliance, any agent, employee, affiliate or other Person

maintained to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Simmons in the Simmons SEC Reports is

allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the

that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect Simmons' ability to
accurately record, process summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Simmons' internal control over
financial reporting.

  

  

(e)  Since December 31, 2017, (i) neither any Simmons Entity nor, to the
Knowledge of Simmons, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or

methodologies or methods of any Simmons Entity or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that any Simmons Entity has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices and (ii) no attorney representing any Simmons Entity,
whether or not employed by any Simmons Entity, has reported evidence of a
material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar

extension of time within which to file any Tax Return (other than any
extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the Ordinary Course). All material
Taxes of the Simmons Entities (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have
been fully and timely paid. There are no Liens for any material amount of
Taxes (other than a Lien for Taxes not yet due and payable or which are being
contested in appropriate proceedings) on any of the Assets of the Simmons
Entities. No claim has ever been made in writing by an authority in a
jurisdiction where any Simmons Entity does not file a Tax Return that such

treated as a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Each Simmons Entity
has in effect all Permits necessary for it to own, lease or operate its

Regulatory Authority or the staff thereof (i) asserting that any Simmons
Entity is not in compliance with any Laws or Orders, or (ii) requiring any
Simmons Entity to enter into or consent to the issuance of a cease and
desist order, injunction, formal or informal agreement, directive, consent
decree, commitment or memorandum of understanding, order of prohibition or

materially the conduct of its business.

  

  

5.10.  Legal Proceedings.

Orders outstanding against any Simmons Entity.

  

   

40

Since December 31, 2013, each Simmons Entity has filed all material reports
and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, including Call Reports, that it was required to file with Regulatory
Authorities (other than the SEC). As of its respective date, each such report
and document did not, in all material respects, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or
necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading.

  

  

5.12.  Statements True and Correct.

  

  

(a)  None of the information supplied or to be supplied by any Simmons Entity
or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion (including by incorporation by
reference) in the Registration Statement to be filed by Simmons with the SEC,

by reference), be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
portions of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement relating to
Simmons and its Subsidiaries and other portions within the reasonable control
of Simmons and its Subsidiaries will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

other Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, will, at the respective time such documents are filed, and with

5.13.  Tax and Regulatory Matters.

  

  

No Simmons Entity or, to the Knowledge of Simmons, any Affiliate thereof has
taken or agreed to take any action, and Simmons does not have any
Knowledge of any agreement, plan or other circumstance, that is reasonably
likely to (a) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (b) materially
impede or delay receipt of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

  

  

5.14.  Brokers and Finders.

the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim
financial statements to normal recurring year-end adjustments that are not

financial statements contained in the Call Reports) consistently applied,
except as may be otherwise indicated in the notes thereto and except for the
omission of footnotes. Notwithstanding the above, neither Party shall be
obligated to disclose to the other Party any reports to the extent such
reports contain confidential supervisory information or other information the
disclosure of which would be prohibited by applicable Law.

ARTICLE 7 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

7.1.  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement; Shareholder Approvals.

  

  

(a)  Simmons and Reliance shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, a
proxy statement/prospectus in definitive form (including any amendments
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and Simmons shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Registration Statement (including the prospectus of Simmons and
Proxy Statement constituting a part thereof and all related documents) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, subject
to full cooperation of both Parties and their respective advisors and
accountants. Simmons and Reliance agree to cooperate, and to cause their
respective Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other Party and its counsel
and its accountants in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement. Each of Simmons and Reliance agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing
thereof, and Reliance shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to
its shareholders promptly following the date of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement. Simmons also agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Reliance shall furnish all information concerning Reliance and
the holders of Reliance Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each of Simmons and Reliance agrees to
furnish to the other Party all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable or as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Simmons,
Reliance, or their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Authority in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Reliance shall have the right to review and consult with Simmons
with respect to any information included in the Registration Statement prior
to its being filed with the SEC. Simmons will advise Reliance, promptly after
Simmons receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Simmons
Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or
written threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by
the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

  

  

(b)  Reliance shall duly call, give notice of, establish a record date for,
convene and hold a shareholders' meeting (" _Reliance 's Shareholders'
Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for the purpose of
obtaining the Reliance Shareholder Approval and, such other related matters as
it deems appropriate. Reliance agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b) shall not be affected by the commencement,
proposal, disclosure or communication to Reliance of any Acquisition
Proposal. Reliance shall (i) through its board of directors
unanimously recommend to its shareholders the approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Reliance Recommendation_
"), (ii) include such Reliance Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Reliance Shareholder
Approval. Neither the board of directors of Reliance nor any committee thereof
shall withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Simmons, the Reliance
Recommendation, or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or
release inconsistent with the Reliance Recommendation, or submit
this Agreement to Reliance's shareholders without recommendation (any of the
foregoing being a " _Change in the Reliance Recommendation_ "). If requested
by Simmons, Reliance shall retain a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to,
and on terms reasonably acceptable to, Simmons in connection with obtaining
the Reliance Shareholder Approval.

  

   

47

 

    

  

(c)  Reliance shall adjourn or postpone Reliance's Shareholders' Meeting, if,
as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Reliance Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting. Reliance shall also adjourn or postpone Reliance's
Shareholders' Meeting, if on the date of Reliance's Shareholders' Meeting
Reliance has not recorded proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Reliance Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Reliance's Shareholders' Meeting shall be
convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Reliance
at Reliance's Shareholders' Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the
approval of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Reliance of such
obligation.

  

  

7.2.  Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a)  No Reliance Entity shall, and it shall cause its respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage (including by providing information or assistance), facilitate or
induce any Acquisition Proposal (ii) engage or participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished to any person
any information or data in connection with, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquires or the making of any offer or proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or
recommend, or propose to approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 by any Subsidiary or
Representative of Reliance shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.2 by
Reliance. In addition to the foregoing, Reliance shall not submit to the
vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

  

  

(b)  Each Reliance Entity shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing activities, discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any offer
or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expect to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to any Person (other than the
Simmons Entities and their Representatives) that has made or indicated an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) not waive any or amend
any "standstill" provision or provisions of similar effect to which it is a
beneficiary and shall strictly enforce any such provisions.

  

  

(c)   If any Reliance Entity or their respective Representatives receives any
request for nonpublic information or any inquiry that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, Reliance shall as promptly as
practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) notify Simmons in writing of
the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and the terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including,
in each case, the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry), and Reliance shall as promptly as practicable
(but in no event more than 24 hours) provide to Simmons (i) a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if in writing, or (ii) a written
summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, if oral. Reliance shall provide Simmons as promptly as practicable
(but in no event more than 24 hours) with notice setting forth all such
information as is necessary to keep Simmons informed on a current basis of
all developments, discussions, negotiations and communications regarding
(including amendments or proposed amendments to) such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry.

  

   

48

 

    

  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to
Reliance's Shareholders' Meeting, the board of directors of Reliance may make
a Change in the Reliance Recommendation (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, approving, endorsing or recommending any Acquisition Proposal), if (i)
Reliance has received a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the terms
of any revised offer by Simmons pursuant to this Section 7.2(d)), and (ii) the
board of directors of Reliance has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, that the board of directors of Reliance may not take the
actions set forth in this Section 7.2(d) unless:

  

  

(i)  Reliance has complied in all material respects with this Section 7.2;

  

  

(ii)  Reliance has provided Simmons at least five Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of
the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such
action (including all necessary information under Section 7.2(c));

  

  

(iii)  during such five Business Day period, Reliance has and has caused its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, consider and negotiate with
Simmons in good faith (to the extent Simmons desires to so negotiate)
regarding any proposals, adjustments or modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Simmons; and

  

  

(iv)  the board of directors of Reliance has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications
proposed to by Simmons, if any, that such Superior Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal and that failure to make a Change in the Reliance
Recommendation would be a violation of the director's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and, in which event, the board of directors of Reliance may
communicate the basis for its lack of Reliance Recommendation to its
shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto to the extent required by Law; provided, that the resolution approving
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended.

  

  

Any material amendment to any Superior Proposal, will be deemed to be a new
Superior Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2(d) and will require a new
determination and notice period as referred to in this Section 7.2(d). 

  

  

(e)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Reliance or its board
of directors from complying with applicable provisions of the Exchange Act,
including the SEC's Regulation 14E thereunder, with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or from making any disclosure to the shareholders of Reliance if the
board of directors of Reliance (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be a violation of the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any actions
taken to comply with such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any such action would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  

  

7.3.  Exchange Listing.

  

  

Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective
Time, on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares
of Simmons Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Reliance Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger, and Simmons shall give all notices and make all
filings with Nasdaq required in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein.

  

   

49

 

    

  

7.4.  Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

  

  

(a)  Simmons and Reliance and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all applications, notices and filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Regulatory Authorities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the
Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all
such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Regulatory Authorities. Each of Reliance and Simmons shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be
asserted with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby under any applicable Law or Order; provided, that in no event shall any
Simmons Entities be required, and the Reliance Entities shall not be
permitted (without Simmons' prior written consent in its sole discretion) to
take any action, or to commit to take any action, or to accept any
restriction or condition, involving the Reliance Entities or the Simmons
Entities, which is materially burdensome on Simmons' business or on the
business of Reliance or Reliance Bank, in each case following the Closing or
which would likely reduce the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to Simmons to such a degree that Simmons would
not have entered into this Agreement had such condition or restriction been
known to it at the date hereof (any such condition or restriction, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ ").

  

  

(b)  Each of Simmons and Reliance shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or
Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, provided, that Reliance shall not have the right to review
portions of material filed by Simmons with a Regulatory Authority that
contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information or
confidential supervisory information filed under a claim of confidentiality.
In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Parties agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party agrees that it will
consult with the other Party with respect to the obtaining of all Permits
and Consents of third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
each Party will keep the other Party apprised of the status of material
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including advising the other Party upon receiving any communication from a
Regulatory Authority the Consent of which is required for the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
required consent or approval from a Regulatory Authority will not be obtained
or that the receipt of such consent or approval may be materially delayed (a "
_Regulatory Communication_ "). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory
Communication, without limiting the scope of the foregoing paragraphs, the
receiving Party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (i) promptly
advise the other Party of the receipt of such Regulatory Communication and
(ii) provide the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the preparation of any response thereto and to review any such response prior
to the filing or submission thereof (other than portions of materials to be
filed or submitted in connection therewith that contain confidential or non-
public supervisory information or competitively sensitive business or
proprietary information).

  

  

(c)  Each Party agrees, upon request, subject to applicable Laws, to promptly
furnish the other Party with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of such other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or Regulatory Authority.

  

   

50

 

    

  

7.5.  Investigation and Confidentiality.

  

  

(a)  Reliance shall promptly notify Simmons of any material change in the
normal course of its business or in the operation of its properties and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, of any material governmental
complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of a material
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving Reliance or
Reliance Bank.

  

  

(b)  Reliance shall promptly advise Simmons of any fact, change, event or
circumstance known to Reliance (i) that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Reliance or (ii) which Reliance believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably
could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure of a condition in ARTICLE 8; provided, that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not
be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 7.5(b) or the failure of
any condition set forth in Section 8.2 to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 to be satisfied.

  

  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Reliance shall permit Simmons to make or
cause to be made such investigation of the business, properties, assets,
Books and Records, and personnel of it and its Subsidiaries and of their
respective financial and legal conditions as Simmons reasonably requests and
furnish to Simmons promptly all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Simmons may reasonably request, provided that
such investigation or requests shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal
operations. No investigation by Simmons shall affect the ability of Simmons
to rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
Reliance. Neither Simmons nor Reliance nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Simmons' or Reliance's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any
common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties) or
contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding Contract entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

  

  

(d)  Each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, hold any information obtained in connection with this Agreement and in
pursuit of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms
of the confidentiality agreement, dated June 7, 2017, 2018, between Simmons
and Reliance (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). If this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly return or
certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all work
papers containing confidential information received from the other Party.

  

  

7.6.  Press Releases.

  

  

Reliance and Simmons agree that no press release or other public disclosure
or communication (including communications to employees, agents and
contractors) related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be issued by either Party (or its Affiliates) without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6
shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any press release or other
public disclosure required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United
States or non-United States securities exchange, in which case the
Party required to make the release or disclosure shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or disclosure in advance of the issuance thereof. The Parties have
agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement.

  

   

51

 

    

  

7.7.  Tax Treatment.

  

  

(a)  Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action which
would cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax
purposes. The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
in order to obtain the Tax Opinion. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

  

  

(b)  Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
appropriate officers to execute and deliver to Covington and Burling LLP,
certificates containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel, at such time or times as
may be reasonably requested by such counsel, including as of the
effective date of the Proxy Statement and the Closing Date, in connection
with such counsel's deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment
of the Merger.

  

  

(c)  Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of Simmons and
Reliance shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take any
inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

  

  

7.8.  Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  

  

(a)  Following the Effective Time, except as contemplated by this Agreement,
Simmons shall provide generally to officers and employees (as a group) who
are actively employed by a Reliance Entity on the Closing Date (" _Covered
Employees_ ") while employed by Simmons following the Closing Date employee
benefits under Employee Benefit Plans offered to similarly situated employees
of Simmons, including severance benefits in accordance with the applicable
severance policy of Simmons (other than to any Covered Employee who is party
to individual agreements or letters that entitle such person to different
severance or termination benefits); provided, that in no event shall any
Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of
any Simmons Entity. Until such time as Simmons shall cause the Covered
Employees to participate in the applicable Simmons Employee Benefit Plans,
the continued participation of the Covered Employees in the Reliance Benefit
Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause (it
being understood that participation in Simmons' Employee Benefit Plans may
commence at different times with respect to each of Simmons' Employee Benefit
Plans). For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting
under Simmons' Employee Benefit Plans, and for purposes of determining a
Covered Employee's entitlement to paid time off under Simmons' paid time off
program, the service of the Covered Employees with a Reliance Entity prior to
the Effective Time shall be treated as service with a Simmons Entity
participating in such employee benefit plans, to the same extent that such
service was recognized by the Reliance Entities for purposes of a similar
benefit plan; provided, that such recognition of service shall not (i)
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the
same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement (x) under which similarly-situated employees of Simmons
Entities do not receive credit for prior service, (y) that is grandfathered
or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation, or (z)
for purposes of retiree medical benefits or level of benefits under a defined
benefit pension plan.

  

   

52

 

    

  

(b)  If requested by Simmons in a writing delivered to Reliance following the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, the Reliance Entities shall take
all necessary action (including without limitation the adoption of resolutions
and plan amendments and the delivery of any required notices) to terminate,
effective as of no later than the day before the Closing Date, any
Reliance Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) (a " _401(k)
Plan_ "). Reliance shall provide Simmons with a copy of the resolutions, plan
amendments, notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the
termination of the 401(k) Plans in advance and give Simmons a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered
in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date, Reliance shall provide Simmons
with the final documentation evidencing that the 401(k) Plans have been
terminated.

  

  

(c)  Upon request by Simmons in writing prior to the Closing Date, the
Reliance Entities shall cooperate in good faith with Simmons prior to the
Closing Date to amend, freeze, terminate or modify any other Reliance Benefit
Plan to the extent and in the manner determined by Simmons effective upon the
Closing Date (or at such different time mutually agreed to by the parties) and
consistent with applicable Law. Reliance shall provide Simmons with a copy of
the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 7.8(c), as applicable, and
give Simmons a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents (which
comments shall be considered in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date,
Reliance shall provide Simmons with the final documentation evidencing that
the actions contemplated herein have been effectuated.

  

  

(d)  The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties, and no Covered Employee, current or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement: (i) establish, amend, or modify any Reliance Benefit Plan or any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Simmons, Reliance or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Simmons or any Simmons Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, the Reliance Entities) to amend, modify or terminate any
Reliance Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or
(iii) confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant, any right to employment or continued employment or continued
service with Simmons or any Simmons Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing Date, the Reliance Entities), or constitute or create an employment
agreement with any employee, or interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of the Surviving Corporation, Reliance, Simmons or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Reliance or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

  

  

7.9.  Indemnification.

  

  

(a)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Simmons shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors or
officers of the Reliance Entities, as well as Brouster and Associates, LLC and
The Dittrich Company (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all
Liabilities arising out of actions or omissions arising out of the Indemnified
Party's service or services as directors or officers or consultants of
Reliance or, at Reliance's request, of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted under state Law and by Reliance's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date hereof,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the defense
of any Litigation and whether or not any Simmons Entity is insured against
any such matter. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in
which approval by Simmons is required to effectuate any indemnification,
Simmons shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified Party, that the
determination of any such approval shall be made by independent counsel
mutually agreed upon between Simmons and the Indemnified Party.

  

   

53

 

    

  

(b)  Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts (and Reliance shall
cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect
for a period of six years after the Effective Time Reliance's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (provided, that Simmons
may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less
advantageous to the insured or (ii) with the consent of Reliance given prior
to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims arising from
facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering
persons who are currently covered by such insurance; provided, that Simmons
shall not be obligated to make aggregate premium payments for such six-year
period in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which
exceed, for the portion related to Reliance's directors and officers, 200% of
the annual premium payments currently paid on Reliance's current policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the
amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Simmons shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In
lieu of the foregoing, Simmons, or Reliance in consultation with Simmons, may
obtain on or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in this Section 7.9(b) at a
premium not to exceed the Maximum Amount. If the premium necessary to
purchase such "tail" prepaid policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Simmons may
purchase the most advantageous "tail" prepaid policy obtainable for a premium
equal to the Maximum Amount, and in each case, Simmons shall have no further
obligations under this Section 7.9(b) other than to maintain such
"tail" prepaid policy.

  

  

(c)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.9(a), upon learning of any such Liability or Litigation, shall promptly
notify Simmons thereof. In the event of any such Litigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time): (i) Simmons shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof and Simmons shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Simmons elects not to assume such defense or
independent legal counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Simmons and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Simmons shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; provided, that Simmons shall be obligated pursuant to this Section
7.9(c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties; (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation;
and (iii) Simmons shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent; and provided, further, that Simmons shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  

  

(d)  If Simmons or any successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of
such consolidation or merger or if Simmons (or any successors or assigns)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any Person, then and
in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Simmons shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.9.

  

  

(e)  The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their respective
heirs and Representatives. Reliance shall cooperate prior to the Effective
Time with any other reasonable insurance-related requests Simmons may make.

  

   

54

 

    

  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.9 to the contrary, no
indemnification payments will be made to an Indemnified Party with respect to
an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any federal banking
agency unless all of the following conditions are met: (i) the Simmons' board
of directors determines in writing that the Indemnified Party acted in good
faith and in the best interests of the Reliance or Reliance Bank; (ii) the
Simmons' board of directors determines that the payment will not materially
affect the Simmons' safety and soundness; (iii) the payment does not fall
within the definition of a prohibited indemnification payment under 12 C.F.R.
Part 359; and (iv) the Indemnified Party agrees in writing to reimburse
the Simmons, to the extent not covered by permissible insurance, for payments
made in the event that the administrative or civil action instituted by a
banking Regulatory Authority results in a final order or settlement in which
the Indemnified Party is assessed a civil money penalty, is prohibited from
banking, or is required to cease an action or perform an affirmative action.

  

  

7.10.  Operating Functions.

  

  

Reliance and Reliance Bank shall cooperate with Simmons and Simmons Bank in
connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of
the Parties and the operation of the Surviving Entity, and in preparing for
the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be effective at the
Effective Time or such later date as Simmons may decide. Reliance shall take
any action Simmons may reasonably request prior to the Effective Time to
facilitate the combination of the operations of Reliance with Simmons. Each
Party shall cooperate with the other Party in preparing to execute after the
Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations
generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-
disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the
other party). Without limiting the foregoing, Reliance shall provide office
space and support services (and other reasonably requested support and
assistance) in connection with the foregoing, and senior officers of Reliance
and Simmons shall meet from time to time as Reliance or Simmons may
reasonably request to review the financial and operational affairs of
Reliance and Reliance Bank, and Reliance shall give due consideration to
Simmons' input on such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding
any other provision contained in this Agreement, (a) neither Simmons nor
Simmons Bank shall under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of
Reliance, Reliance Bank or any other Reliance Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, (b) neither Reliance nor any Reliance Bank shall be under any
obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be deemed to constitute
anti-competitive behavior under federal or state antitrust Laws, and (c)
neither Reliance nor Reliance Bank shall be required to agree to any material
obligation that is not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In
addition, Reliance shall cooperate with Simmons' reasonable requests in
connection with the redemption of any Reliance Capital Stock.

  

  

7.11.  Shareholder Litigation.

  

  

Each of Simmons and Reliance shall promptly notify each other in writing of
any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by
or before, or otherwise involving, any Regulatory Authority or arbitrator
pending or, to the Knowledge of Simmons or Reliance, as applicable, threatened
against Simmons, Reliance or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a)
questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Simmons, Reliance or their
respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to
enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Reliance shall give Simmons every opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any shareholder litigation against Reliance and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Simmons' prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

   

55

 

    

  

7.12.  Legal Conditions to Merger and Bank Merger.

  

  

Subject to Sections 7.1 and 7.4 of this Agreement, each of Simmons and
Reliance shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable
best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper
or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and Bank
Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any Consent or Order by,
any Regulatory Authority and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by Reliance or Simmons or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with, or to effect, the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement (including, any merger between a Subsidiary of
Simmons, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Reliance, on the other hand) or
to vest the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Entity with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the Parties to the Merger and Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors
of each Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by Simmons.

  

  

7.13.  Change of Method.

  

  

Simmons may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of
Reliance and Simmons (including by providing for the merger of Reliance with
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Simmons) if and to the extent requested by
Simmons, and Reliance agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement
as Simmons may reasonably request in order to give effect to such
restructuring; provided, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect
to Reliance's shareholders or (iii) materially delay or impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

7.14.  Takeover Laws.

  

  

Neither Simmons nor Reliance shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Simmons and
Reliance shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from
any applicable Takeover Law now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Law
may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Simmons and Reliance will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any
such Takeover Law.

  

  

7.15.  Closing Financial Statements.

  

  

At least eight Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Reliance shall
provide Simmons with Reliance's consolidated financial statements
presenting the financial condition of Reliance and its Subsidiaries as of the
close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the
Effective Time and Reliance's consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
and shareholders' equity for the period from January 1, 2018 through the
close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Closing Financial Statements_ "); provided, that if
the Effective Time occurs on or before the 17th Business Day of the month,
Reliance shall have provided consolidated financial statements as of and
through the second month preceding the Effective Time. Such financial
statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of Reliance's chief financial
officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial
statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of the
certificate, the financial condition of Reliance in all material respects.
Such financial statements shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
and regulatory accounting principles and other applicable legal and accounting
requirements, and reflect all period-end accruals and other adjustments. Such
Closing Financial Statements shall also reflect as of their date (a) accruals
for those Transaction Expenses that have been accrued up to, and including,
the date of the Closing Financial Statements, (b) the capital ratios
set forth in Section 8.2(g), and (c) the asset quality metrics set forth in
Section 8.2(e) and shall be accompanied by a certificate of Reliance's chief
financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such
financial statements meet the requirements of this Section 7.15 and continue
to reflect accurately, as of the date of such certificate, the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and
shareholders' equity of Reliance in all material respects.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the ratios set forth in
Sections 8.2(e) and 8.2(g) shall be computed by adding back those
Transaction Expenses that have been accrued up to, and including, the date of
the Closing Financial Statements as if such Transaction Expenses had not been
incurred. A schedule setting forth such Transaction Expenses in reasonable
detail shall accompany the delivery of the Closing Financial Statements.

  

   

56

 

    

  

7.16.  Special Distribution and Subordinated Debt.

  

  

(a)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Reliance shall cause Reliance
Bank to effect a cash distribution to Reliance (" _Special Distribution_ ")
in an amount of at least $23,500,000 (" _Minimum Amount_ "). If (i) the
conditions in Section 8.2(g) are not satisfied (regardless of whether such
conditions are waived by Simmons) and (ii) the Special Distribution is
not effected or is less than the Minimum Amount, then the Aggregate Cash
Consideration shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis. As an example,
if (i) the conditions in Section 8.2(g) are not satisfied and (ii) the amount
of the Special Distribution is $15,000,000, then the Aggregate Cash
Consideration shall be reduced from $62,700,000 to $54,200,000.

  

  

(b)  Prior to the Effective Time, Reliance shall sell, or cause to be sold,
all 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes of Simmons due 2028 ("
_Simmons Subordinated Debt_ ") held by any Reliance Entity so that, as of the
Effective Time, no Reliance Entity shall be the holder of any Simmons
Subordinated Debt.

  

  

7.17.  Convertible Debt.

  

  

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Reliance shall cause all then-
outstanding indebtedness of Reliance that is convertible into Reliance
Common Stock (" _Convertible Debt_ ") to convert into Reliance Common Stock
(for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Reliance Common Stock issued as a
result of the conversion of the Convertible Debt shall be deemed issued and
outstanding). In addition, prior to the Effective Time, Reliance shall cause
all approvals and consents associated with the Convertible Debt that are
necessary for the consummation of the Merger to be obtained. Reliance shall
provide Simmons with such documentation and other information as Simmons may
deem reasonably necessary to evidence Reliance's satisfaction of its
obligations under this Section 7.17.

  

  

  

7.18.  Dividends.

  

  

After the date of this Agreement, each of Reliance and Simmons shall
coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Reliance Capital Stock and Simmons Capital Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
Parties that holders of Reliance Capital Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Reliance Capital Stock and any shares of Simmons Capital Stock
any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

  

   

57

 

    

  

ARTICLE 8 
 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS TO CONSUMMATE

  

  

8.1.  Conditions to Obligations of Each Party.

  

  

The respective obligations of each Party to perform this Agreement and

subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions, unless waived by both Parties pursuant to Section 10.6:

or non-objections from the Federal Reserve, MDF, Arkansas State Bank
Department, the FDIC, and any other Regulatory Authority and (ii) any other
regulatory approvals or consents contemplated by Sections 4.2(c) and 5.3(c)
the failure of which to obtain has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Simmons and Reliance (considered as a consolidated entity), in each case
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, shall have been obtained and shall remain in full force
and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have
expired (all such approvals and the expiration of all such waiting periods
being referred to as the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ ");
provided, that no such Requisite Regulatory Approval shall impose a
Burdensome Condition as determined by Simmons in its sole discretion.

  

  

(c)   _Legal Proceedings_. No court or Regulatory Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or taken any other
action which prohibits, restricts or makes illegal the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger).

  

  

(d)   _Registration Statement_. The Registration Statement shall be effective
under the Securities Act, no stop orders suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall have been issued, and no action, suit, proceeding
or investigation by the SEC to suspend the effectiveness thereof shall have

(g)   _Tax Matters_. Each Party shall have received a written opinion of
Covington and Burling LLP, in form reasonably satisfactory to such Parties (the
" _Tax Opinion_ "), to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. In rendering such Tax Opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to rely
upon representations of officers of Reliance and Simmons reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel.

  

   

58

 

    

  

8.2.  Conditions to Obligations of Simmons.

  

  

The obligations of Simmons to perform this Agreement and consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the
satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions,
unless waived by Simmons pursuant to Section 10.6(a):

  

  

(a)   _Representations and Warranties_. For purposes of this Section 8.2(a),
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Reliance set forth in
this Agreement shall be assessed as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Effective Time with the same effect as though all such representations
and warranties had been made on and as of the Effective Time (provided that
representations and warranties which are confined to a specified date shall
speak only as of such date). The representations and warranties of Reliance
set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3(a), 4.3(c), 4.4(a), 4.4(c), 4.10(a),
4.15(b), 4.17, 4.21, and 4.34 shall be true and correct (except for
inaccuracies in Section 4.3(a) that are de minimis in amount). The
representations and warranties of Reliance set forth in Sections 4.3(b),
4.3(d), 4.4(b), 4.4(d), 4.5, 4.6, 4.25, 4.27, and 4.28 be true and correct in
all material respects; provided, that, for purposes of this sentence only,
those representations and warranties which are qualified by references to
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or to the "Knowledge" of any Person
shall be deemed not to include such qualifications. The representations and
warranties set forth in each other section in ARTICLE 4 shall, in the
aggregate, be true and correct in all respects except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct, has not had or
would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and notwithstanding
the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of Reliance, this
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and Bank Merger abandoned at any
time prior to the Effective Time:

  

  

(a)  By mutual written agreement of Simmons and Reliance;

  

  

(b)  By either Party, by written notice to the other Party, in the event (i)
any Regulatory Authority has denied a Requisite Regulatory Approval, provided
that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(b)(i) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and
change such denial, (ii) any Law or Order permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have become final and
nonappealable, provided that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to contest, appeal and remove such Law or Order, or (iii) the
shareholders of Reliance fail to vote their approval of the matters relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at Reliance's
Shareholders' Meeting where such matters were presented to such shareholders
for approval and voted upon;

  

  

(c)  By either Party, by written notice to the other Party, in the event that
the Merger shall not have been consummated by November 30, 2019, if the
failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on or before such
date is not caused by any breach of this Agreement by the Party electing to
terminate pursuant to this Section 9.1(c);

  

  

(d)  By Simmons, by written notice to the Reliance, in the event that the
board of directors of Reliance has (i) failed to recommend the Merger and the

effected a Change in the Reliance Recommendation, (ii) breached the terms of
Section 7.2 in any respect adverse to Simmons, or (iii) breached its
obligations under Section 7.1 by failing to call, give notice of, convene
and/or hold Reliance's Shareholders' Meeting in accordance with Sections

pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i) shall expire in the event that, notwithstanding
a Change in the Reliance Recommendation, this Merger and this Agreement are
approved at the Reliance Shareholders' Meeting;

  

  

(e)  By Reliance, by written notice to Simmons, in the event of a breach of
any of the covenants or agreements (or any representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Simmons, which
breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with
all other breaches by Simmons (or failure of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of any of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Reliance to consummate the Merger contained in Section 8.3,
and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to Simmons, or
by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days
as remain prior to the date specified in Section 9.1(c)) (provided, that
Reliance is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement);

  

  

(f)  By Simmons, by written notice to Reliance, in the event of a breach of
any of the covenants or agreements (or any representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Reliance, which
breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with
all other breaches by Reliance (or failure of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of any of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Simmons to consummate the Merger contained in Section 8.2, and
which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to Reliance, or by
its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as
remain prior to the date specified in Section 9.1(c)) (provided, that Simmons
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement);

  

   

61

 

    

  

(g)  By Simmons, by written notice to Reliance, if any Regulatory Authority
has granted a Requisite Regulatory Approval but such Requisite Regulatory
Approval contains, or shall have resulted in or would reasonably be expected
to result in, the imposition of a Burdensome Condition; or

  

  

(h)  By Simmons, by written notice to Reliance, if any Regulatory Authority
shall have requested in writing that Simmons, Reliance or any of their
respective Affiliates withdraw (other than for technical reasons), and not be
permitted to resubmit within 60 days, any application with respect to a
Requisite Regulatory Approval.

  

  

(i)  By Reliance, if the board of directors of Reliance so determines by a
vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the entire board of directors
of Reliance at any time during the five-day period commencing with the
Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

  

  

(i)   the Average Closing Price is less than $25.12; and

  

  

(ii)  the difference between (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
average of the closing price of the Nasdaq Bank Index (as reported in The
Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another alternative source as
chosen by Simmons) for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on and
including the 10th trading day preceding the Closing Date by (2) 4,247.094
and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Average Closing Price by
(2) $31.40, is greater than 0.20 (or 20%),

  

  

subject, however to the following three sentences. If Reliance elects to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(i), it shall give
written notice to Simmons (provided that such notice of termination may be
withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day period). During the
five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Simmons shall have
the option to, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to increase the
Aggregate Cash Consideration by an amount in cash so that, as a result of such
adjustment, the sum of (i) the Aggregate Cash Consideration and (ii) the
Stock Consideration multiplied by the Average Closing Price shall be no less
than the Minimum Merger Consideration. If Simmons so elects within such five-
day period, it shall give prompt written notice to Reliance of such election
and the revised Cash Consideration, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(i) and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Cash Consideration shall
have been so modified). " _Minimum Merger Consideration_ " shall be the sum
of (i) the product of (x) $25.12 and (y) the Stock Consideration and (ii) the
Aggregate Cash Consideration.

In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no further force or
effect and there shall be no Liability on the part of any Party for any
matters addressed herein or other claim relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) the provisions of this
Section 9.2, Section 7.5(d), and ARTICLE 10, shall survive any such
termination and abandonment and (ii) no such termination shall relieve the
breaching Party from Liability resulting from any fraud or breach by that
Party of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination or abandonment.
In addition, in the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) or Section 9.1(d), all non-solicitation
provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, shall become void and
have no further force or effect.

  

   

62

 

    

  

9.3.  Non-Survival of Representations and Covenants.

  

  

The respective representations, warranties, obligations, covenants, and
agreements of the Parties shall not survive the Effective Time except this

10.9.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

  

  

(a)  The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in all respects in accordance with the Laws of the State of Arkansas without
regard to any conflict of Laws or choice of Law principles that might
otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the
substantive Law of another jurisdiction (except that matters relating to the
fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Reliance shall be subject to
the Laws of the State of Missouri).

  

  

(b)  Each Party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction located in the State of Arkansas (the "Chosen Courts"), and,
solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection
to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of
process upon such party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if
notice is given in accordance with Section 10.8.

  

  

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.9.

  

  

10.10.  Counterparts; Signatures.

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use
of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to
deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment or waiver hereto or any
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement or the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each
Party forever waives any such defense.

10.11.  Captions; Articles and Sections.

  

  

The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the referenced
Articles and Sections of this Agreement.

  

  

10.12.  Interpretations.

  

  

Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No Party shall be considered the draftsman. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and,
unless otherwise defined herein, the words used shall be construed and
interpreted according to their ordinary meaning so as fairly to accomplish the
purposes and intentions of all Parties.

  

  

10.13.  Enforcement of Agreement.

  

  

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that money damages would be
both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled,
without the requirement of posting bond, to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties waives any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

  

  

10.14.  Severability.

  

  

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.
