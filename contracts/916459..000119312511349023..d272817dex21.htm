In the event that  at any time between the Closing Date and the date upon
which the liability of the Sellers for Taxes or social security matters shall
expire pursuant to Subsection 11.3.1(a)any law, regulation, order or decree
should be enacted in Italy having as an effect the right to settle, in whole
or in part, Tax and/or social security obligations of the Company or the
Subsidiaries (or any of them) covered by the Sellers indemnity obligation
hereunder (any such law, regulation, order or decree is hereinafter referred
to as an "Amnesty" and it will, in particular  but without limitationrefer
to what is commonly known as "condono" in Italian Tax law and politics), the
following provisions shall apply : 



     | (a) | the Sellers shall have the right (but not the duty) to
request the Purchaser that Robuschi avail itself of the Amnesty. Where the
Sellers communicate that they consider making such a request, the Purchaser
shall cause Robuschi to deliver all information to the Sellers that is
reasonably needed to make a fully informed decision about making the above-
mentioned request; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Purchaser shall have the right to determine, in its sole
discretion (irrespective of any request of the Sellers under letter (a)
preceding), whether or not Robuschi should avail itself of the Amnesty; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | if the Purchaser elects to proceed with an Amnesty without
the prior written agreement or written request of the Sellers, all costs and
expenses of such Amnesty shall be borne by the Purchaser or by Robuschi,
without recourse against the Sellers hereunder; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | if the Purchaser elects to proceed with an Amnesty in
written agreement with the Sellers or pursuant to the Sellers request
hereunder, all costs and expenses of such Amnesty (including any costs,
expenses or increase in tax liabilities incurred by the Robuschi Group or the
Purchaser after the Closing Date) shall be borne by the Sellers; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | if the Purchaser elects not to proceed with an Amnesty
notwithstanding the Sellers request pursuant to letter (a) preceding, it
shall be free to do so, but the Sellers liability under Section 11.1 in
respect of the matter constituting the subject of such Amnesty shall be
limited to the amount that would have been paid by the Sellers pursuant to
letter (d) preceding had the Purchaser elected to proceed with the Amnesty in
accordance with the Sellers request. 
---|---|--- 



   11.6 | Severability. 
---|--- 

Any payment required to be made by the Sellers under this Article 11 shall be
divided among the Sellers according the Relevant Percentage.

For the purpose of this Agreement "Relevant Percentage" means, in respect of
each Seller:



   (a) | until the Sellers have communicated to the Purchaser the Schedule
3.5 pursuant to Section 3.2, the following percentages: 
---|--- 
 



[*] Confidential Treatment Requested

44 [*]



   (b) | upon delivery of Schedule 3.5 pursuant to Section 3.2, the
percentages of allocation of Price set forth in such Schedule 3.5 provided
that, however, such percentages shall not differ from those set forth under
Subsection 11.6 (a) for more than 2% (two per cent); 
---|--- 



   (c) | after determination and (if any) payment of the Balance, the
percentage equal to the ratio between: (i) the portion of Price paid to the
Seller and (ii) the entire amount of the Price. 
---|--- 

Each of the Sellers shall be liable _vis- a-vis_ the Purchaser for any payment
under this Article 11 [*] with other Sellers.



   12. | ESCROW 
---|--- 



   12.1 | Purpose. 
---|--- 

(a) In accordance with the Escrow Agreement and except for any payment of the
Balance, any payments due by the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to the
indemnification obligations of the Sellers under Section 11.1 shall be paid
out of the Escrow Amount. Purchaser shall therefore be entitled to make a
claim against the Escrow Amount according to the Escrow Agreement and pursuant
to the terms and conditions stipulated therein, _provided that_ any payment
due by Sellers in connection with the indemnification obligation under this
Agreement up to the Escrow Amount (or the lower amount from time to time
existing in the Escrow Agreement) shall only be paid out of the Escrow Amount
by the Escrow Agent according to the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) To the extent that there are not sufficient funds held in escrow pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement to satisfy the Purchasers claim, the Purchaser may
pursue any other rights or means it may have in order to enforce its
indemnification rights provided for under this Agreement, it being understood
that the Escrow Amount does not limit the indemnification obligation of the
Sellers under this Agreement.

(c) The Other Shareholders hereby grant the Sellers Representatives with all
powers to carry out any action, and to grant any consent or waiver for and on
their behalf for the purposes of the Escrow Agreement; in particular, without
limitation, the Other Shareholders grant the Sellers Representatives with all
powers necessary to agree with the Purchaser in connection with any claim
under Section 11.1 and to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay, out of the Escrow
Amount, indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to Section 11.1.

(d) The Escrow Amount shall be released to the Sellers in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



[*] Confidential Treatment Requested

45 ---|--- 

After determination and (if any) payment of the Balance, the Purchaser and
the Sellers shall provide the Escrow Agent, in a timely manner, with jointly
written instructions to procure thatby means of appropriate switches of funds
between the Escrow Accounts (as defined under the Escrow Agreement)  each
Seller contributes to the Escrow Amount in the Relevant Percentage pursuant to
Subsection 11.6(c).

including, for the avoidance of doubt, one or more Other Shareholders. 
---|---|--- 



   14.6 | Further Assurances.

The Parties hereby agree to execute and deliver all such instruments and

fund (" _fondo di investimento mobiliare chiuso_ ") Aksia Capital III
(the "Fund") which is a segregate estate pursuant to Section 36, paragraph 6,
