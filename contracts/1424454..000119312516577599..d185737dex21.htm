Subsidiary of Parent (" _Rovi Merger Sub_ "), and Titan Acquisition Sub, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _TiVo Merger
Sub_ " and, together with Rovi Merger Sub, the " _Merger Subs_ "). Rovi, TiVo,
Parent, Rovi Merger Sub and TiVo Merger Sub are referred to herein
collectively as the " _Parties_ " and individually as a " _Party_ ," and Rovi
and TiVo are each referred to as a " _Principal Party_ ".

 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

Whereas, in anticipation of the Mergers, Rovi has formed (i) Parent, (ii) Rovi
Merger Sub and (iii) TiVo Merger Sub; 

Whereas, (i) each of Rovi, Parent and Rovi Merger Sub desire, following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , to
effect the Rovi Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement whereby Rovi Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Rovi, with
Rovi as the surviving entity in the Rovi Merger (the " _Rovi Surviving
Corporation_ ") and the Rovi Surviving Corporation becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent and (ii) immediately following consummation of the Rovi
Merger, each of TiVo, Parent and TiVo Merger Sub desire, following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , to
effect the TiVo Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby TiVo Merger Sub shall be merged with and into TiVo, with
TiVo as the surviving entity in the TiVo Merger (the " _TiVo Surviving
Corporation_ " and, together with the Rovi Surviving Corporation, the "
_Surviving Corporations_ "), and the TiVo Surviving Corporation becoming a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

Whereas, the Boards of Directors of each of Rovi, TiVo, Parent, Rovi Merger
Sub and TiVo Merger Sub have each determined that it is advisable and in the
best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate
the Mergers and the Transactions (as defined below) on the terms and
conditions set forth herein;

 

Whereas, the Board of Directors of TiVo (the " _TiVo Board_ ") has, subject to
_Sections 5.3(b)_ and  _5.4_ , resolved to recommend the adoption of this
Agreement by the TiVo stockholders;

Whereas, the Board of Directors of Rovi (the " _Rovi Board_ ") has, subject
to _Sections 5.3(c)_ and _5.4_ , resolved to recommend the adoption of this
Agreement by the Rovi stockholders;

 

Whereas, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) it is intended that the
Mergers, taken together, will be treated as an "exchange" described in
Section 351(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder; (ii) it is intended that the
Rovi Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder; and (iii) it is
intended that this Agreement will be, and is, adopted as a plan of
reorganization; and Whereas, Rovi, TiVo, Parent, Rovi Merger Sub and TiVo Merger Sub desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the Mergers and also to prescribe various conditions to the

conversion of shares of TiVo Common Stock pursuant to this  _Section 2.2_
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated
by _Section 2.5_ are referred to collectively as " _TiVo Merger
Consideration_." As of the TiVo Effective Time, all such shares of TiVo
Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of TiVo Common Stock (a "
_TiVo Certificate_ ") or shares of TiVo Common Stock held in book entry form
(" _TiVo Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with the
applicable provision(s) of _Section 2.7_, and in accordance with _Sections

of $7.95 divided by the Average Rovi Stock Price; _provided_ , _however_ that,
if the Average Rovi Stock Price is less than $18.71 but greater than or equal
to $16.00, then Rovi shall elect to set the Exchange Ratio as any fraction,
in its sole discretion, between (x) 0.4250 and (y) the fraction obtained by
dividing $7.95 by the applicable Average Rovi Stock Price, up to a maximum of
0.4969.

 



5 (iii) If the Average Rovi Stock Price is less than $16.00, then the Exchange
Ratio will be, in Rovis sole discretion, set at either (x) 0.4969 or (y) the
Exchange Ratio that Rovi would have elected under the proviso of _Section
2.2(d)(ii)_ had such provision been applicable.

 

Rovi shall make a public announcement of its election in the circumstances
contemplated by _Section 2.2(d)(ii)_ or _Section 2.2(d)(iii)_ above, to the
extent applicable, at least two (2) Trading Days prior to the date of the
Effective Times. The Exchange Ratio will be calculated and rounded in all
cases to four decimal points, and shall in no event be less than 0.3180 or
greater than 0.4969, subject to _Section 2.4_.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ " shall mean:

 

(1) if _Section 2.2(d)(i)_ above applies, $2.75 per share of TiVo Common
Stock, or

 

(2) if _Section 2.2(d)(ii)_ above applies, an amount of cash per share of
TiVo Common Stock equal to (A) $10.70 minus (B) the product of (1) the
Average Rovi Stock Price multiplied by (2) the applicable Exchange Ratio, or

(3) if  _Section 2.2(d)(iii)_ applies, an amount of cash per share of TiVo
Common Stock equal to (A) $10.70 minus (B) the product of (1) $16.00
multiplied by (2) the applicable Exchange Ratio.

 

In no event shall the Per Share Cash Amount exceed $3.90 per share of TiVo
Common Stock or be less than $2.75 per share of TiVo Common Stock, subject
to  _Section 2.4_.

(ii) the " _Average Rovi Stock Price_ " shall mean the average of the volume
weighted averages of the trading prices of Rovi Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Stock Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by the Parties) on
each of the fifteen (15) consecutive Trading Days ending on (and including)
the Trading Day that is three (3) Trading Days prior to the date of the Rovi
Effective Time; and

 

(iii) " _Trading Day_ " shall mean a day on which shares of Rovi Common Stock
are traded on NASDAQ.

 

(f) Each share of common stock of TiVo Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the TiVo Effective Time shall be converted into one
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the TiVo Surviving
Corporation.

 



6 2.3 Effect on Parent Capital Stock. At the Rovi Effective Time, each share of
capital stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Rovi
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

2.4 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Times, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, Rovi Common Stock or TiVo Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the TiVo Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Cash
Amount, the Average Rovi Stock Price and any other similarly dependent items,
as the case may be, without duplication, shall be equitably adjusted to
provide the holders of Rovi Common Stock and TiVo Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

2.5 Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of TiVo
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.2_, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Parent Common Stock. All fractional shares to which a single record holder of
TiVo Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated
and calculations shall be rounded to four decimal places. In lieu of any such
fractional shares, each holder of TiVo Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash,
without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A)
the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled under _Section 2.2(b)_ (or would be entitled
but for this _Section 2.5_) and (B) the Average Rovi Stock Price. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of TiVo Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts, without interest, to the holders of TiVo Common Stock entitled to
receive such cash.

2.6 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of TiVo Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the TiVo Effective Time and that are held by
any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the TiVo Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.2_, but
rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the
TiVo Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with Section 262; _provided, however,_ that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the TiVo Effective Time into, and
to have become exchangeable solely for, the TiVo Merger Consideration as
provided in  _Section 2.2(b)_. TiVo shall serve prompt notice to Rovi of any
demands received by TiVo for appraisal of any shares of TiVo Common Stock, and
Rovi shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the TiVo Effective Time, TiVo shall
not, without the prior written consent of Rovi, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



7 2.7 Exchange of TiVo Certificates.

 

(a) Prior to the TiVo Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a nationally
recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to TiVo (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), it being agreed by the Parties
that the American Stock Transfer and Trust Company is acceptable, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of TiVo Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article II_ , through the Exchange Agent, subject to
_Section 2.7(b)(ii)_, certificates representing the full number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.2_ in exchange for
outstanding shares of TiVo Common Stock. Prior to the TiVo Effective Time,
Rovi shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent all of
the cash necessary to pay the cash portion of the TiVo Merger Consideration,
and Parent shall, after the TiVo Effective Time on the appropriate payment
date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any
dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to  _Section 2.7(c)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such initial deposit, Rovi shall
assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the
Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.5_. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the Parent Common Stock and cash
contemplated to be issued pursuant to  _Section 2.2_ or _Section 2.5_ out
of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

 

(b) Exchange Procedures.

 

(i) TiVo Certificates. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the TiVo Effective Time, to each holder
of record of a TiVo Certificate whose shares were converted into the Parent
Common Stock portion of the TiVo Merger Consideration and the right to receive
the cash portion of the TiVo Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Sections
2.2(b)_ and _2.5_ , (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the TiVo
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the TiVo Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions
as are reasonably satisfactory to both of TiVo and Rovi) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the TiVo Certificates in exchange for
the TiVo Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a TiVo Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such TiVo Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange thereof as promptly as practicable (A) the Per Share Cash Amount,
(B) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-
certificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to clause (ii)

 



8  of _Section 2.2(b)_ (after taking into account all shares of TiVo Common
Stock then held by such holder), (C) any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to  _Section 2.7(c)(i)_ and (D) cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_, and the TiVo
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of TiVo Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of TiVo, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the TiVo Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such TiVo Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such TiVo Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Subject to _Section 2.6_, until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 2.7_, each TiVo Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the TiVo Effective Time to represent only the Parent Common Stock
portion of the TiVo Merger Consideration and the right to receive upon such
surrender the cash portion of the TiVo Merger Consideration, in each case,
into which the shares of TiVo Common Stock theretofore represented by such
TiVo Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)(i)_ and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any TiVo
Certificate.

 

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any holder of TiVo Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a TiVo Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent to receive the TiVo Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more TiVo Book-Entry Shares whose shares of TiVo
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the TiVo Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to 
_Section 2.7(c)(ii)_ shall automatically upon the TiVo Effective Time (or, at
any later time at which such TiVo Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the TiVo Effective Time, in respect
of each share of TiVo Common Stock (A) the Per Share Cash Amount, (B) the
number or shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder of
record) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, (C) any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)(ii)_ and (D)
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_, and
the TiVo Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled.

 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.

 

(i) TiVo Certificates. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the TiVo Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any certificate formerly representing TiVo Common Stock
with respect to the Parent Common Stock portion of the TiVo Merger
Consideration related to such TiVo Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares related to such

 



9  TiVo Certificate shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
2.5_, until the surrender of such TiVo Certificate in accordance with this
_Article II_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such TiVo
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.5_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the TiVo Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the TiVo
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Holders of TiVo Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock under this _Article II_ shall be paid
(A) at the time of payment and delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent under  _Section 2.7(b)_, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the TiVo Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the TiVo Effective Time but prior to the time of such payment and
delivery by the Exchange Agent under _Section 2.7(b)_ and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such payment and delivery by the Exchange Agent
under _Section 2.7(b)_ payable with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock.

(d) The TiVo Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the
terms of this  _Article II_ upon the surrender of the TiVo Certificates (or,
automatically, in the case of the TiVo Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of TiVo Common Stock (other than the right to receive the
payments and deliveries contemplated by this _Article II_ ). After the TiVo
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the TiVo Surviving Corporation of shares of TiVo
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the TiVo Effective
Time. If, after the TiVo Effective Time, any TiVo Certificates formerly
representing shares of TiVo Common Stock are presented to the TiVo Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of TiVo Common Stock for six (6) months after the TiVo Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of TiVo Common Stock who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of its claim for the TiVo Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated
by _Section 2.7(c)_.

 



10 (f) None of Rovi, Parent, the Merger Subs, TiVo or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange
Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent in accordance with _Section
2.7(e)_) properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) In the event any TiVo Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such TiVo Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, to the extent
customarily required by Parent or Rovi, the posting by such Person of a bond
in reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such TiVo Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed TiVo Certificate the shares of
Parent Common Stock and the cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions
that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed TiVo Certificate been surrendered
as provided in this _Article II_.

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent; _provided_ that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the TiVo Merger Consideration
payable to holders of TiVo Common Stock entitled to receive
such consideration, including cash in lieu of fractional interests, and
Parent shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of TiVo Common Stock entitled to
receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses or if for any
reason such funds are unavailable for payment to the holders of shares of TiVo
Common Stock.

 

(i) Each Rovi Certificate immediately prior to the Rovi Effective Time shall,
from and after the Rovi Effective Time, represent shares of Parent Common
Stock constituting the Rovi Merger Consideration. At the Rovi Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall exchange by book entry transfer all uncertificated
shares of Rovi Common Stock (excluding any shares of Rovi Common Stock to
be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_) for shares of Parent Common Stock
constituting the Rovi Merger Consideration; _provided, however,_ that if an
exchange of Rovi Certificates for new certificates is required by Law or
applicable rule or regulation, or is desired at any time by Parent, in its
sole discretion, Parent shall arrange for such exchange on a one-for-one-share
basis. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Rovi Effective Time, the
holders of such Rovi Certificates which have been exchanged for certificates
of Parent Common Stock, as well as those shares of Rovi Common Stock exchanged
by book entry pursuant to this _Section 2.7(i)_, shall be entitled to receive
dividends and distributions made with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock.

2.8 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Times, the officers and
directors of Parent, the Rovi Surviving Corporation or the TiVo Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the

11 2.9 TiVo Stock Options, Other Stock-Based Awards and Warrants.

 

(a) As of the TiVo Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of TiVo
Common Stock (each, a " _TiVo Stock Option_ ") granted under the TiVo Inc.
1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, the TiVo Inc. 1999 Equity
Incentive Plan, and the TiVo Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Award Plan
(collectively, and together with the TiVo ESPP, the " _TiVo Stock Plans_ ")
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the TiVo Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, other than any TiVo Stock
Option that is held by any Person who is not either a Covered Employee or
a Covered Consultant, shall automatically and without any required action on
the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof, be assumed by Parent and shall
be converted into a stock option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to
acquire Parent Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.9_. Each such
Parent Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the TiVo
Stock Option immediately prior to the TiVo Effective Time (but, taking into
account any changes thereto provided for in the TiVo Stock Plans, in any award
agreement or in such TiVo Stock Option by reason of this Agreement or the
Transactions). As of the TiVo Effective Time, each such Parent Stock Option
as so assumed and converted (i) shall be exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of TiVo Common Stock subject to
such TiVo Stock Option and (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the
exercise price for each share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the Parent Stock Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of
TiVo Common Stock of such TiVo Stock Option by (y) the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to the Parent Stock Option shall be determined in
a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in
the case of TiVo Stock Options that are intended to qualify as incentive
stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with
the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of the Exchange Ratio and the
Cash Portion Exchange Ratio. The " _Cash Portion Exchange Ratio_ " means the
quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Per Share Cash Amount by (2) the Average
Rovi Stock Price.

 

(b) As of the TiVo Effective Time, each award of TiVo Common Stock subject to
time-based vesting or lapse restrictions (each, a " _TiVo Restricted Stock
Award_ ") granted under any TiVo Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately
prior to the TiVo Effective Time, other than any TiVo Restricted Stock Award
that is held by any Person who is not either a Covered Employee or a Covered
Consultant, shall be assumed by Parent and shall, automatically and without
any required action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof, be
converted into a restricted stock award denominated in shares of Parent
Common Stock (each, a " _Parent Restricted Stock Award_ ") in accordance with
this _Section 2.9_. Each such Parent Restricted Stock Award shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions as
applied to the TiVo Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the TiVo
Effective Time (but, taking into account any changes thereto provided for in
the TiVo Stock

 



12  Plans, in any award agreement or in such TiVo Restricted Stock Award by
reason of this Agreement or the Transactions), except that each such Parent
Restricted Stock Award as so assumed and converted shall cover that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of TiVo Common Stock underlying
such TiVo Restricted Stock Award multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio.

(c) As of the TiVo Effective Time, each award of TiVo Common Stock subject to
performance-based vesting or lapse restrictions (each, a " _TiVo Performance
Stock Award_ ") granted under any TiVo Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the TiVo Effective Time shall, automatically and without
any required action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof, be
assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a time-based restricted stock
award denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Converted
Restricted Stock Award_ ") in accordance with this _Section 2.9_. Each such
Parent Converted Restricted Stock Award as so assumed and converted shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the TiVo Performance Stock Award immediately prior to the TiVo
Effective Time but, taking into account any changes thereto provided for in
the TiVo Stock Plans, in any award agreement or in such TiVo Performance Stock
Award by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions, including that (i)
such Parent Converted Restricted Stock Award as so assumed and converted shall
cover that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
TiVo Common Stock underlying such TiVo Performance Stock Award, assuming
achievement of target-level performance with respect to the performance period
applicable thereto, multiplied by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio and; (ii)
such Parent Converted Restricted Stock Award shall thereafter be subject to
only time-based vesting or lapse restrictions, with such time-based vesting or
lapse restrictions deemed to have commenced as of the grant date of the
underlying TiVo Performance Stock Award and subject to vesting in three equal
annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of such grant date.

(d) As of the TiVo Effective Time, each restricted stock unit subject to
time-based vesting restrictions (each, a " _TiVo RSU_ ") granted under any
TiVo Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the TiVo Effective
Time whether vested or unvested shall be assumed by Parent and shall be
converted into a restricted stock unit award to acquire Parent Common Stock
(each, a " _Parent RSU_ ") in accordance with this _Section 2.9_. Each such
Parent RSU as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the TiVo
RSU immediately prior to the TiVo Effective Time (but, taking into account any
changes thereto provided for in the TiVo Stock Plans, in any award agreement
or in such TiVo RSU by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of
the TiVo Effective Time, each such Parent RSU as so assumed and converted
shall cover that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of TiVo
Common Stock underlying to such TiVo RSU multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award
Exchange Ratio.

 

(e) The right to acquire shares of TiVo Common Stock under the TiVo Inc. 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _TiVo ESPP_ ") is not a TiVo Stock Option
for purposes of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing Date, the TiVo Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee administering the TiVo ESPP) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions 

 



13  as may be required to provide that, with respect to the TiVo ESPP: (i) each
individual participating in the offering period (as defined in the TiVo ESPP)
in progress as of, the Closing Date (the " _Final Offering_ ") shall receive
notice of the Transactions no later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing
Date and shall have an opportunity to terminate his or her outstanding
purchase rights under the TiVo ESPP; (ii) the Final Offering shall end on no
later than the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the Closing Date; (iii) each
TiVo ESPP participants accumulated contributions under the TiVo ESPP shall be
used to purchase shares of TiVo Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
the TiVo ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering; (iv) the applicable
purchase price for TiVo Common Stock as set forth in the TiVo ESPP shall not
be decreased below the levels set forth in the TiVo ESPP as of the date of
this Agreement and (v) the TiVo ESPP shall terminate immediately following the
end of the Final Offering and no further rights shall be granted or exercised
under the TiVo ESPP thereafter.

 

(f) Outstanding TiVo Stock Options held by individuals other than Covered
Employees or Covered Consultants, whether vested or unvested, shall not be
assumed by Parent and shall (A) become exercisable in full immediately prior
to the TiVo Effective Time for fully vested shares of TiVo Common Stock, and
(B) to the extent outstanding immediately prior to the TiVo Effective Time,
be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive for each
share of TiVo Common Stock subject to such TiVo Stock Option, (i) (x) the Per
Share Cash Amount, and (y) the Per Share Stock Amount minus (ii) the
exercise price of such TiVo Stock Option (the net amount of (i) minus (ii),
the " _Per Share Option Payment_ "). Payment of the Per Share Option Payment
shall be conducted in the same manner as payment of the TiVo
Merger Consideration to holders of TiVo Capital Stock as provided in _Section
2.7_ hereof; _provided_ that payment of the Per Share Option Payment to a
former employee of TiVo shall be less any required withholding of Taxes under
applicable Law, and any payments of the Per Share Cash Amount (after
deduction of withholding Taxes) shall be effected through the TiVo Surviving
Corporations (or its Affiliates) normal payroll processes. The exercise
price and any required withholding Taxes will be deducted first from the Per
Share Cash Amount, and then from the Per Share Stock Amount (by cancelling a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock based on the Average Rovi Stock
Price). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any amount be
payable in respect of any TiVo Stock Option if the exercise price payable in
respect of a share of TiVo Common Stock subject to such TiVo Stock Option is
equal to or exceeds the sum of the Per Share Stock Amount and the Per Share
Cash Amount, and such TiVo Stock Option shall be cancelled at the TiVo
Effective Time.

(g) As of the TiVo Effective Time, any shares of TiVo Common Stock subject to
a TiVo Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
TiVo Effective Time and for which any repurchase rights held by TiVo lapse as
of the TiVo Effective Time (including any shares pursuant to a TiVo
Performance Stock Award that converts to a Parent Converted Restricted Stock
Award and is deemed to vest as of the TiVo Effective Time) shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive the TiVo Merger Consideration as
provided in  _Section 2.7_ hereof; _provided_ that payment of the TiVo
Merger Consideration shall be less any required withholding of Taxes under
applicable Law and any payments of the Per Share Cash Amount (after deduction
of withholding Taxes) shall be effected through the TiVo Surviving
Corporations (or its Affiliates) normal payroll processes. Any required
withholding Taxes will be deducted first from the Per Share Cash Amount, and
then from the Per Share Stock Amount (by cancelling a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock based on the Average Rovi Stock Price).

 



14 (h) Not later than the Closing Date, TiVo shall deliver to the holders of TiVo
Stock Options, TiVo Restricted Stock Awards, TiVo Performance Stock Awards,
and TiVo RSUs notices, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting
forth the effect of the Mergers on such holders rights and describing the
treatment of such awards in accordance with this _Section 2.9_.

(i) Prior to the TiVo Effective Time, TiVo shall take all necessary action
to: (i) effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.9_; and (ii) ensure
that after the TiVo Effective Time, neither any holder of Parent Stock
Options, Parent Restricted Stock Awards, Parent Converted Restricted Stock
Awards, or Parent RSUs, or any beneficiary thereof, nor any other participant
in any TiVo Stock Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any
securities of TiVo or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any
award previously granted under the TiVo Stock Plans, except as provided in
this _Section 2.9_. At the TiVo Effective Time, Parent shall assume the TiVo
Stock Plans, provided that all references to "TiVo Inc." in the applicable
TiVo Stock Plan and the documents governing the Parent Stock Options, Parent
Restricted Stock Awards, Parent Converted Restricted Stock Awards and Parent
RSUs will, after the TiVo Effective Time, be deemed references to Parent and
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock available for awards under the
TiVo Stock Plans shall be determined by adjusting the number of shares of TiVo
Common Stock available for awards under the TiVo Stock Plans immediately prior
to the TiVo Effective Time in accordance with the Stock Award Exchange Ratio.

(j) Rovi shall, or shall cause Parent to, reserve for future issuance a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that will be subject to Parent Stock Options, Parent
Restricted Stock Awards, Parent Converted Restricted Stock Awards, and Parent
RSUs as a result of the actions contemplated by this  _Section 2.9_.

2.10 Rovi Stock Options, Other Stock-Based Awards and Warrants.

 

(a) As of the Rovi Effective Time, (i) each stock option (each, a " _Rovi
Stock Option_ ") outstanding under any equity compensation plan, agreement or
arrangement of Rovi (collectively, and together with the Rovi ESPP, the "
_Rovi Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Rovi
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed
by Parent and shall be converted automatically into a Parent Stock Option on
substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule and
per share exercise price) as applied to such Rovi Stock Option immediately
prior to the Rovi Effective Time; (ii) each award of Rovi Common Stock subject
to time-based or performance-based vesting or lapse restrictions that is

conditions (including vesting schedule) as applied to such Rovi Restricted
Stock Award immediately prior to the Rovi Effective Time; (iii) each

restrictions that is outstanding under any

 



15  equity compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Rovi, whether or not
vested (each, a " _Rovi RSU_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and shall be
converted automatically into a Parent RSU on substantially the same terms and
conditions (including vesting and issuance schedule) as applied to such Rovi
RSU immediately prior to the Rovi Effective Time.

 

(b) Not later than the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the holders of
Rovi Stock Options, Rovi Restricted Stock Awards and Rovi RSUs any required
notices setting forth the effect of the Mergers on such holders rights and
describing the treatment of such awards in accordance with this _Section
2.10_.

 

(c) As of the Rovi Effective Time, any right to purchase shares of Rovi Common
Stock under the Rovi Corporation 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "

Common Stock, subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the Rovi ESPP, and the Rovi ESPP and such purchase rights shall be
assumed by Parent.

(d) Prior to the Rovi Effective Time, Rovi shall take all necessary action to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.10_. Parent shall reserve for
future issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to Rovi Stock
Options, Rovi Restricted Stock Awards and Rovi RSUs as a result of the
actions contemplated by this _Section 2.10_.

(e) Not later than the Closing Date, Parent shall file an effective
Registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Stock Options, Parent
Restricted Stock Awards, and Parent Converted Restricted Stock Awards,
and Parent RSUs, and shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8,
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Parent Stock Options, Parent Restricted Stock Awards, Parent
Converted Restricted Stock Awards and Parent RSUs remain outstanding.

 

2.11 Withholding. Parent, TiVo and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any amount properly deducted or withheld
pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ shall be treated as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. In the case
of any amounts properly withheld from any payments not consisting entirely of
cash, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be treated as though it withheld an
appropriate amount of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of TiVo Common Stock, sold such Parent Common Stock
for an amount of cash equal to its fair market value at the time of such
deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the holder of TiVo Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Parent, TiVo or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all
amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the
period required under applicable Law.

3.3 Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation.

(a) TiVo has requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to receipt of TiVo Stockholder Approval, to consummate

that it is in the best interests of TiVo and its stockholders, and declared
it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the

submitted for consideration of the stockholders of TiVo at the TiVo
Stockholders Meeting. Except for the TiVo Stockholder Approval and the filing
of the TiVo Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of TiVo are necessary to
authorize the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by TiVo and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Rovi, Parent and the Merger
Subs, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of TiVo, enforceable
against TiVo in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

(b) Assuming that on the date of this Agreement neither Rovi nor any of
its "affiliates" or "associates" is an "interested stockholder" of TiVo (each
term, as defined in DGCL Section 203), the only vote of holders of any class
or series of TiVo Capital Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and to
approve the TiVo Merger is the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the shares of TiVo Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote
thereon (the " _TiVo Stockholder Approval_ "). The affirmative vote of the
holders of TiVo Capital Stock is not necessary to consummate any Transaction
other than the TiVo Merger.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by TiVo of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Mergers by TiVo do not and will not require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification
to any United States or foreign governmental or regulatory agency,
commission, court, body, entity or authority (each, a " _Governmental Entity_
"), other than (i) the filing of the TiVo Certificate of Merger, (ii)

Act_ "), including the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (iv)
compliance with the rules and regulations of the National Association of
Securities Dealers and NASDAQ, (v) compliance with any applicable foreign or
state securities or blue sky laws, and (vi) the other consents and/or
notices set forth on _Section 3.3(c)_ of the TiVo Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, clauses (i) through (vi), the " _TiVo Specified Approvals_ "),
and other than any consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing
or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not (A) have a
TiVo Material Adverse Effect or (B) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Mergers.

 

(d) Assuming receipt of or compliance with the TiVo Specified Approvals and
the receipt of the TiVo Stockholder Approval, the execution, delivery and
performance by TiVo of this Agreement and the consummation by TiVo of the
Mergers and the other Transactions do not and will not (i) contravene or
conflict with the organizational or governing documents of TiVo or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation
of any provision of any Law or Order binding upon or applicable to TiVo or any

or lapse of time, or both) under, or, other than with respect to the TiVo
Convertible Senior Notes, the TiVo Bond Hedge Options and the TiVo Warrants,
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under, any loan,
guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement or other contract, commitment instrument or
obligation (each, including all amendments thereto, a " _Contract_ ") binding
upon TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation of a Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of TiVo or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii),
any such violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not be material to TiVo and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are
no material unresolved comments issued by the staff of the SEC with respect to
any of the TiVo SEC Documents.

 



20 (b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of TiVo included in the TiVo SEC Documents (if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment filed prior to the date hereof) and all
related compilations, reviews and other reports issued by TiVos accountants
with respect thereto (the " _TiVo SEC Financial Statements_ ") comply in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of TiVo and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto). The TiVo SEC Financial
Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case
of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in
the notes thereto).

 

(c) The books and records of TiVo and its Subsidiaries are accurate and
complete, have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices
and accurately present and reflect in all material respects all of the
transactions and actions therein described and the TiVo SEC Financial
Statements have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
such books and records. At the Closing, all such books and records will be in
the possession of TiVo or its applicable Subsidiary. No financial statements
of any Person other than TiVo and its Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be
included in the consolidated financial statements of TiVo. Except as required
by GAAP, TiVo has not, between February 1, 2016 and the date of this
Agreement, made or adopted any material change in its accounting methods,
practices or policies in effect on February 1, 2016.

3.5 Internal Controls and Procedures.

 

(a) TiVo is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or under the Exchange Act (the " _Sarbanes-
Oxley Act_ ") and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of NASDAQ.

 

(b) TiVo has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required in all material respects by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
TiVos disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by TiVo in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to TiVos management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. TiVos
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of TiVos internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended January 31, 2016,
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable
TiVo SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment
thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. Based on TiVos managements most recently completed
evaluation of TiVos internal control over financial

 



21  reporting, (i) TiVo had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect TiVos ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) TiVo does
not have Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in TiVos internal
control over financial reporting. The assessment of the effectiveness of
TiVos internal controls over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included in the TiVo SEC Documents.

3.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a) as reflected or reserved against
in TiVos most recent consolidated audited balance sheet as of January 31,
2016 (the " _Reference Date_ ") (or the notes thereto), as included in the
TiVo SEC Documents, (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
connection with or contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, (c) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
the Reference Date and (d) for liabilities and obligations which have
been discharged or paid in full, neither TiVo nor any Subsidiary of TiVo has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of TiVo and its Subsidiaries.

3.7 Compliance with Law; Permits.

 

(a) TiVo and each of its Subsidiaries (i) are in compliance with and are not
in default under or in violation (A) of any applicable federal, state, local
or foreign law, statute, constitution, treaties, convention, ordinance, code,
rule, regulation (whether civil, criminal or administrative), judgment, order,
injunction, decree, resolution, arbitration award or agency requirement or
other similar requirement enacted, issued, adopted, promulgated, entered into
or applied by any Governmental Entity, including for the avoidance of doubt,
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (collectively, " _Laws_ "
and each, a " _Law_ "), or (B) of any Contract to which TiVo or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties is bound or affected, except in each case under
clause (A) and (B), for any such non-compliance, default or violation that
would not have a TiVo Material Adverse Effect and (ii) have not received
written notice of any violation of any Law. No representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be made in this _Section 3.7(a)_ in respect of the matters
referenced in _Section 3.4_.

 

(b) TiVo and its Subsidiaries have in effect privacy compliance and data
security programs and policies to enhance awareness of and compliance by TiVo
and its Subsidiaries with relevant United States and applicable foreign Laws
concerning privacy and data security, except as would not have a TiVo Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(c) TiVo and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity
necessary for TiVo and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _TiVo Permits_ ") and each of the TiVo Permits is valid,
subsisting and in full force and effect, except where the failure to have or
maintain any such TiVo Permit would not have a TiVo Material Adverse Effect or
materially impair the ability of TiVo to perform its

 



22  obligation hereunder or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions. The operation of the business of TiVo and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted is not, and has not been since January 1, 2013, in
violation of, nor is TiVo or its Subsidiaries in default or violation under,
any TiVo Permit, and, to the Knowledge of TiVo, no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation of any material terms, condition or provision of any TiVo Permit,
except where such default or violation of such TiVo Permit would not have a
TiVo Material Adverse Effect. There are no actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of TiVo, threatened, that seek the revocation, cancellation or
adverse modification of any TiVo Permit, except where such revocation,
cancellation or adverse modification would not have a TiVo Material Adverse
Effect or materially impair the ability of TiVo to perform its obligation
hereunder or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the
Transactions. Since January 1, 2013, neither TiVo nor its Subsidiaries have
received or been subject to any written notice, charge, claim or assertion,
or, to the Knowledge of TiVo, any other notice, charge, claim or assertion, in
each case alleging any violations of the TiVo Permits, nor to the Knowledge of
TiVo, has any such notice, charge, claim or assertion been threatened,
except where the receipt of such notice, charge, claim or assertion would not
have a TiVo Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of TiVo
to perform its obligation hereunder or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the Transactions.

3.8 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) _Section 3.8(a)_ of the TiVo Disclosure Schedule lists all material TiVo
Benefit Plans, and identifies any such material TiVo Benefit Plans that are
TiVo Foreign Plans. " _TiVo Benefit Plans_ " means all employee, consultant or
director compensation and/or benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements, or
other arrangements, including any employee welfare plan within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ "), any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA), and any
bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock
option, severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan,
program or agreement, employee loan programs, other equity compensation
awards, profit-sharing arrangements, other paid-time-off programs, health
benefit plans, insurance arrangements covering employees, consultants and
directors, in each case that are sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of current or former
employees, directors or consultants of TiVo or its Subsidiaries, or with
respect to which TiVo or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability
(contingent or otherwise), other than any TiVo Foreign Plan that represents a
scheme or arrangement mandated by a Governmental Entity outside of the United
States. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _TiVo Foreign Plan_ " shall
refer to each plan, program or contract that is subject to or governed by the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States and that would have
constituted a TiVo Benefit Plan had it been a United States plan, program or
contract.

modify any existing TiVo Benefit Plan, except as required by applicable Law or
tax qualification requirement, which would materially increase the expense of
maintaining any TiVo Benefit Plan. There have been no modifications of a TiVo
Benefit Plan or creation of new TiVo Benefit Plans since the last audited
company balance sheet that would materially increase the expense of
maintaining any such TiVo Benefit Plan.

 

(c) Except as would not be material to TiVo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole: (i) each TiVo Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in
compliance with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code to the extent applicable thereto; (ii) each of the TiVo Benefit Plans
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to

TiVo, there are no existing circumstances or any events that have occurred
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such plan; (iii) all contributions or other amounts payable by TiVo or its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof with respect to each TiVo Benefit Plan in
respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in
accordance with GAAP (other than with respect to amounts not yet due); (iv)
neither TiVo nor its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction in connection
with which TiVo or its Subsidiaries reasonably could be subject to either a
civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a
material Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code; (v) there
are no pending, threatened or, to the Knowledge of TiVo, anticipated claims
(other than claims for benefits in accordance with the terms of TiVo Benefit
Plans) by, on behalf of, against or with respect to any of the TiVo Benefit
Plans or any trusts related thereto which could reasonably be expected to
result in any liability of TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi) all TiVo
Foreign Plans (A) have been maintained in all material respects in accordance
with their terms and all applicable Laws and requirements; (B) if they are
intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, meet all material requirements
for such treatment; and (C) if they are required to be funded and/or book-
reserved, are funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based
upon reasonable actuarial assumptions and in accordance with applicable Law.
" _ERISA Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any entity, trade or business,
any other entity, trade or business that is a member of a group described
in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA
that includes the first entity, trade or business, or that is a member of the
same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant to
Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

(d) Except as otherwise contemplated under this Agreement, neither the
execution nor delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions shall, whether alone or in combination with any other event,
result in (i) the accelerated vesting, delivery or payment of, or any (A)
increase in (for any executive officer or director), or (B) material increase
in (for any non-executive officer employee), any compensation to any present
or former executive officer, director or non-executive officer employee,
respectively, of TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the entitlement of any
present or former employee or director of TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance or termination pay or any retention, bonus, change in control or
similar payments or benefits, or of any present or former non-executive
officer employee of TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries to material severance or
termination pay or any retention, bonus, change in control or similar payments
or benefits, (iii) any obligation to pay 

 



24  or fund (through a grantor trust or otherwise) any compensation or benefits
under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, or increase the cost of, any TiVo Benefit Plan, (iv) a
limitation of or restriction on the right of TiVo or any Subsidiary or, after
the Closing, Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any TiVo Benefit Plan or (v)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any TiVo Benefit
Plan. _Section 3.8(d)_ of the TiVo Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
(1) each employee who has entered into, and is currently subject to, (w) a
Senior Vice President Change of Control Terms and Conditions Agreement, (x) a
Vice President Change of Control Terms and Conditions Agreement, (y) a Senior

any TiVo Benefit Plan that provides vesting acceleration benefits which are
in addition to the acceleration benefits contained in the TiVo Stock Plans or
one of the forms of Change of Control Terms and Conditions Agreements listed
in clause (v)(1) above.

 

(e) With respect to any TiVo Benefit Plan, no administrative investigation,
audit or other administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the
Internal Revenue Service or other United States Governmental Entity is in
progress or, to the Knowledge of TiVo, pending or threatened.

 

(f) Neither TiVo, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates
has within the past six (6) years (i) contributed to a TiVo Benefit Plan or
any other employee benefit plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) been obligated to contribute to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) been
obligated to contribute to a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined
in Section 3(40) of ERISA or (iv) been the employer or connected or associated
with the employer (as those terms are used in the United Kingdom Pensions Act
2004) of any defined benefit pension arrangement. No material liability under
Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by TiVo or any of its ERISA Affiliates
which has not been satisfied in full and no event has occurred and, to
the Knowledge of TiVo, no condition exists that could reasonably be likely to
result in TiVo or any of its ERISA Affiliates incurring a material liability
under Title IV of ERISA.

 

(g) Except as set forth on _Section 3.8(g)_ of the TiVo Disclosure Schedule,
neither TiVo nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or is obligated to make any
payment (including any transfer of property or provision of any benefit) in
connection with the Transactions which, alone or aggregated with any other
payment, would be an excess parachute payment within the meaning of Section
280(G) of the Code. No TiVo Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up of any
Taxes payable by any individual.

(h) Each TiVo Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code that is subject to

respects with Section 409A of the Code.

term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) materially complies with
the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and any applicable
similar state or local Law except as would not have a

 



25  TiVo Material Adverse Effect, (ii) to the Knowledge of TiVo, each such TiVo
Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without material liability to TiVo
or any of its Subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time and
(iii) no such TiVo Benefit Plan provides benefits to, or on behalf of, any
former employee after the termination of employment except (A) where the full
cost of such benefit is borne entirely by the former employee (or such former
employees eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or (B) where the benefit is
required by Section 4980B of the Code.

Parent, the Merger Subs or any Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, of any kind, including without limitation any

4.3 Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation.

 

(a) Each of Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the
Rovi Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The Rovi Board,

determined that it is in the best interests of Rovi, Parent, the Merger
Subs and their respective stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter
into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Rovi
Merger, and thereby (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs, as applicable, approve the adoption of this

the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Mergers (the " _Rovi
Recommendation_ ") and directed that such matter be submitted for
consideration of the stockholders of Rovi at the Rovi Stockholders Meeting.
The Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Merger Subs has approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions, including the Mergers. Except for the Rovi Stockholder
Approval, the adoption of this Agreement by Rovi as the sole stockholder of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of
each of the Merger Subs, and the filing of the Certificates of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Rovi, Parent or the Merger Subs are necessary to authorize the
consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs and, assuming
this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Rovi, this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Rovi, Parent and the
Merger Subs, enforceable against each of Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

(b) Assuming that on the date of this Agreement neither TiVo nor any of
its "affiliates" or "associates" is an "interested stockholder" of Rovi (each
term, as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL), the only vote of holders of any
class or series of Rovi Capital Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement, to
approve the Rovi Merger and approve the issuance of the Parent Common Stock is
the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the shares of
Rovi Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon (the " _Rovi
Stockholder Approval_ "). The affirmative vote of the holders of Rovi Capital
Stock is not necessary to consummate any Transaction other than the Rovi
Merger.

 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Rovi, Parent and the Merger
Subs of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers by Rovi, Parent
and the Merger Subs do not and will not require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to any
Governmental Entity, other than (i) the filing of the Rovi 

 



37  Certificate of Merger, (ii) compliance with the applicable requirements of
the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust or competition Laws, (iii) compliance
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
including the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement, (iv) compliance with the rules and regulations of the
National Association of Securities Dealers and NASDAQ, (v) compliance with
any applicable foreign or state securities or blue sky laws; (vi) the listing
of the Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ, and (vii) the other consents and/or
notices set forth on _Section 4.3(c)_ of the Rovi Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, clauses (i) through (vi), the " _Rovi Specified Approvals_ "),
and other than any consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or
notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not (A) have a Rovi
Material Adverse Effect or (B) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Mergers.

 

(d) Assuming receipt of or compliance with the Rovi Specified Approvals, and
receipt of the Rovi Stockholder Approval, the execution, delivery and
performance by Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs of this Agreement and the
consummation by Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs of the Mergers and the other
Transactions do not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with the
organizational or governing documents of Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of
any Law or Order binding upon or applicable to Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets or (iii) result in any
violation of, conflict with or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or, other than the Rovi Warrants, give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under, any Contract binding upon Rovi or any of
its Subsidiaries or result in the creation of a Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Rovi or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such
violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, right,
loss or Lien that would not have a Rovi Material Adverse Effect.

and complete, have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices
and accurately present and reflect in all material respects all of the
transactions and actions therein described and the Rovi SEC Financial
Statements have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
such books and records. At the Closing, all such books and records will be in
the possession of Rovi or the applicable Subsidiary of Rovi. No financial
statements of any Person other than Rovi and each of its Subsidiaries are
required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of
Rovi. Except as required by GAAP, Rovi has not, between January 1, 2016 and
the date of this Agreement, made or adopted any material change in its
accounting methods, practices or policies in effect on January 1, 2016.

4.5 Internal Controls and Procedures.

(a) Rovi is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

(b) Rovi has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required in all material respects by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
Rovis disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by Rovi in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to Rovis management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Rovis management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Rovis internal controls over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2015, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Rovi SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on
such evaluation. Based on Rovis managements most recently completed
evaluation of Rovis internal control over financial reporting, (i) Rovi had
no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation
of its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Rovis ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) Rovi does not have Knowledge of any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves

 



39  management or other employees who have a significant role in Rovis internal
control over financial reporting. The assessment of the effectiveness of
Rovis internal controls over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst and
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included in the Rovi SEC Documents

 

4.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a) as reflected or reserved against in
Rovis most recent consolidated audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2015
(or the notes thereto), as included in the Rovi SEC Documents, (b) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business since the Reference Date and (d) for
liabilities and obligations which have been discharged or paid in full,
neither Rovi nor any Subsidiary of Rovi has any liabilities or obligations of
any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Rovi and
its Subsidiaries.

 

4.7 Compliance with Law; Permits.

 

(a) Rovi and each of its Subsidiaries (i) are in compliance with and are not
in default under or in violation (A) of any applicable Law or (B) any
Contract to which Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Rovi
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is bound or
affected, except in each case under clauses (A) and (B), for any such non-
compliance, default or violation that would not have a Rovi Material Adverse
Effect, and (ii) have not received written notice of any violation of any Law.
No representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this  _Section
4.7(a)_ in respect of the matters referenced in _Section 4.4_.

(b) Rovi and its Subsidiaries have in effect privacy compliance and data
security programs and policies to enhance awareness of and compliance by Rovi
and its Subsidiaries with relevant United States and applicable foreign Laws
concerning privacy and data security, except as would not have a Rovi
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Rovi and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity
necessary for Rovi and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _Rovi Permits_ ") and each of the Rovi Permits is valid,
subsisting and in full force and effect, except where the failure to have or
maintain any such Rovi Permit would not have a Rovi Material Adverse Effect
or materially impair the ability of Rovi to perform its obligation hereunder
or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions. The
operation of the business of Rovi and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted
is not, and has not been since January 1, 2013, in violation of, nor is Rovi
or its Subsidiaries in default or violation under, any Rovi Permit, and, to
the Knowledge of Rovi, no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or violation of any material
terms, condition or provision of any Rovi Permit, except where such default or
violation of such Rovi Permit would not have a Rovi Material Adverse Effect.
There are no actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Rovi, threatened, that
seek the revocation, cancellation or adverse modification of any Rovi Permit,
except where such revocation, cancellation or adverse modification would not
have a Rovi Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of Rovi
to perform its obligation

 



40  hereunder or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the
Transactions. Since January 1, 2013, neither Rovi nor its Subsidiaries have
received or been subject to any written notice, charge, claim or assertion,
or, to the Knowledge of Rovi, any other notice, charge, claim or assertion, in
each case alleging any violations of the Rovi Permits, nor to the Knowledge of
Rovi, has any such notice, charge, claim or assertion been threatened, except
where the receipt of such notice, charge, claim or assertion would not have a
Rovi Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of Rovi to
perform its obligation hereunder or prevent or materially delay
the consummation of any of the Transactions.

4.8 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) _Section 4.8(a)_ of the Rovi Disclosure Schedule lists all material Rovi
Benefit Plans, and identifies such material Rovi Benefit Plans that are Rovi
Foreign Plans. " _Rovi Benefit Plans_ " means all employee, consultant or
director compensation and/or benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements, or
other arrangements, including any employee welfare plan within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA), and any
bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock
option, severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan,
program or agreement, employee loan programs, other equity compensation
awards, profit-sharing arrangements, other paid-time-off programs, health
benefit plans, insurance arrangements covering employees, consultants and
directors, in each case that are sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of current or former
employees, directors or consultants of Rovi or its Subsidiaries, or with
respect to which Rovi or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability
(contingent or otherwise), other than any Rovi Foreign Plan that represents a
scheme or arrangement mandated by a Governmental Entity outside of the United
States. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Rovi Foreign Plan_ " shall
refer to each material plan, program or contract that is subject to or
governed by the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States and
that would have constituted a Rovi Benefit Plan had it been a United States
plan, program or contract.

(b) Rovi has heretofore made available to TiVo true and complete copies of
each material Rovi Benefit Plan and related material documents, including, but
not limited to, (i) each writing constituting a part of such Rovi Benefit
Plan, including all amendments thereto (or, in the case of any unwritten Rovi
Benefit Plan, a description thereof); (ii) the three most recent Annual
Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, if any; (iii) the most
recent determination letter from the IRS (if applicable) for such Rovi
Benefit Plan; and (iv) forms of award agreements and summary plan descriptions
(if applicable). Neither Rovi nor any of its Subsidiaries has a Contract, plan
or commitment to create any additional Rovi Benefit Plan or to modify any
existing Rovi Benefit Plan, except as required by applicable Law or tax
qualification requirement, which would materially increase the expense of
maintaining any Rovi Benefit Plan. There have been no modifications of a Rovi
Benefit Plan or creation of new Rovi Benefit Plans since the last audited
company balance sheet that would materially increase the expense of
maintaining any such Rovi Benefit Plan.

 



41 (c) Except as would not be material to Rovi and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole: (i) each Rovi Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in
compliance with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code to the extent applicable thereto; (ii) each of the Rovi Benefit Plans
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to
rely upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of
Rovi, there are no existing circumstances or any events that have occurred
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such plan; (iii) all contributions or other amounts payable by Rovi or its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof with respect to each Rovi Benefit Plan in
respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance
with GAAP (other than with respect to amounts not yet due); (iv) neither Rovi
nor its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
Rovi or its Subsidiaries reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material Tax imposed
pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code; (v) there are no pending,
threatened or, to the Knowledge of Rovi, anticipated claims (other than claims
for benefits in accordance with the terms of the Rovi Benefit Plans) by, on
behalf of, against or with respect to any of the Rovi Benefit Plans or any
trusts related thereto which could reasonably be expected to result in any
liability of Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi) all Rovi Foreign Plans
(A) have been maintained in all material respects in accordance with their
terms and all applicable Laws and requirements; (B) if they are intended to
qualify for special Tax treatment, meet all material requirements for such
treatment; and (C) if they are required to be funded and/or book-reserved, are
funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions and in accordance with applicable Law.

(d) Except as otherwise contemplated under this Agreement, neither the
execution nor delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions shall, whether alone or in combination with any other event,
result in (i) the accelerated vesting, delivery or payment of, or any (A)
increase in (for any executive officer or director), or (B) material increase
in (for any non-executive officer employee), any compensation to any present
or former executive officer, director or non-executive officer employee,
respectively, of Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the entitlement of any
present or former employee or director of Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance or termination pay or any retention, bonus, change in control or
similar payments or benefits, or of any present or former non-executive
officer employee of Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries to material severance or
termination pay or any retention, bonus, change in control or similar payments
or benefits, (iii) any obligation to pay or fund (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) any compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable
or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, or increase the cost of,
any Rovi Benefit Plan, (iv) a limitation of or restriction on the right of
Rovi or any Subsidiary or, after the Closing, Parent, to merge, amend or
terminate any Rovi Benefit Plan or (v) result in any breach or violation of,
or a default under, any Rovi Benefit Plan.

(e) With respect to any Rovi Benefit Plan, no administrative investigation,
audit or other administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the
Internal Revenue Service or other United States Governmental Entity is in
progress or, to the Knowledge of Rovi, pending or threatened.

 



42 (f) Neither Rovi, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates
has within the past six (6) years (i) contributed to a Rovi Benefit Plan or
any other employee benefit plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) been obligated to contribute to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) been
obligated to contribute to a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined
in Section 3(40) of ERISA or (iv) been the employer or connected or associated
with the employer (as those terms are used in the United Kingdom Pensions Act
2004) of any defined benefit pension arrangement. No Rovi Benefit Plan
provides retiree medical or other welfare benefits, other than coverage
mandated by applicable Law. No material liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been incurred by Rovi or any of its ERISA Affiliates which has not been
satisfied in full and no event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of Rovi, no
condition exists that could reasonably be likely to result in Rovi or any of
its ERISA Affiliates incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA.

(g) Except as set forth on  _Section 4.8(g)_ of the Rovi Disclosure
Schedule, neither Rovi nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or is obligated to
make any payment (including any transfer of property or provision of any
benefit) in connection with the Transactions which, alone or aggregated with
any other payment, would be an excess parachute payment within the meaning of
Section 280(G) of the Code. No Rovi Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up of
any Taxes payable by any individual.

 

(h) Each Rovi Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code has been operated in compliance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(i) With respect to any Rovi Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
plan, (i) each such Rovi Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as such
term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) materially complies with
the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and any applicable
similar state or local Law except as would not have a Rovi Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) no such Rovi Benefit Plan provides benefits to, or on behalf
of, any former employee after the termination of employment except (A) where
the full cost of such benefit is borne entirely by the former employee (or
such former employees eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or (B) where the
benefit is required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 

4.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. From the Reference Date through the
date of this Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated, required or
permitted by this Agreement, (a) the businesses of Rovi and its Subsidiaries
have been conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary course of
business, (b) neither Rovi nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action
which, if taken after the date hereof, would require the consent of TiVo under
_Section 5.2_ of this Agreement and (c) there has not been any Rovi Material
Adverse Effect.

 

4.10 Investigations; Litigation. (a) There are no Proceedings pending (or, to
the Knowledge of Rovi, threatened) by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Rovi or any of Rovis Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, rights
or properties or any of the officers of directors of Rovi, except, in each
case, for those that, individually or in the aggregate, are not and would not
be material to Rovi and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (b) there are
no Orders pending (or, to the Knowledge of Rovi, threatened) against or

Rovi and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

under the terms of any Rovi Specified Contract; (ii) to the Knowledge of Rovi,
no other party to any Rovi Specified Contract is in breach of or default under
the terms of any Rovi Specified Contract; and (iii) each Rovi Specified

Equity Exception and for each of provisions (i) through (iii) hereof, except
to the extent that particular Rovi Specified Contracts have expired or been
terminated in accordance with their terms, in whole or in part. Since the
Reference Date, neither Rovi nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of any actual, alleged,

 



48  possible or potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any material

any of its subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or finder
in connection with the Transactions who might be entitled to any fee or any
commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Mergers.

 

4.19 State Takeover Statutes. The approval of the Rovi Board of this Agreement
and the Transactions is the only action necessary to render inapplicable (to
the extent otherwise applicable) to this Agreement and the Transactions the
restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL
and, to the Knowledge of Rovi, similar "moratorium," "control share," "fair
price," "takeover" or "interested stockholder" laws.

each material insurance policy and all material claims made under such
policies that have been paid since January 1, 2014 (the " _Rovi Insurance
Policies_ "). Except as would not be material to Rovi and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, each Rovi Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and
all premiums due and payable under the Rovi Insurance Policies have been paid
on a timely basis and Rovi and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all other terms thereof. Complete and correct
copies of the Rovi Insurance Policies have been made available to TiVo.

invalidations, refusals or rejections as would not have a Rovi Material
Adverse Effect. All appropriate insurance carriers under each Rovi Insurance
Policy have been timely notified of all potentially insurable material losses
known to Rovi and pending litigation, and all appropriate actions have been
taken to timely file all claims in respect of such insurable matters.

4.21 Environmental Matters.

(a) Each of Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs is in material compliance with
all Environmental Laws (as defined below), which compliance includes the

material governmental authorizations required under all Environmental Laws and
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof.

 

(b) There is no Environmental Claim pending against Rovi and Rovi has not
received any written communication, whether from a Governmental Entity or
other Person, that alleges that either Rovi or any of its Subsidiaries is not
in material compliance with any Environmental Laws or any material permits
required under any applicable Environmental Law, or that it is liable under
any Environmental Law, or that it is responsible (or potentially

 



49  responsible) for the remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern
(as defined below) at, on or beneath its facilities or at, on or beneath any
land adjacent thereto or any other property, and, to the Knowledge of Rovi,
there are no conditions existing at such facilities that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or interfere with such full compliance or give rise to any
Environmental Claim in the future against Rovi or its Subsidiaries or against
any Person whose liability for any Environmental Claim Rovi has retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of law. Rovi has no Knowledge of
any condition at any of the properties leased by Rovi or any of
its Subsidiaries that would have a Rovi Material Adverse Effect.

Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

4.23 Solvency; Available Funds.

 

(a) As of the Rovi Effective Time, assuming satisfaction of the conditions to
Rovis and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Mergers as set forth
herein, or the waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to all of
the Transactions, including, without limitation, the payment of the TiVo
Merger Consideration and the Rovi Merger Consideration, and payment of
all related fees and expenses, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of
the assets of the TiVo Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, would exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of the
TiVo Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis,
including contingent and other liabilities," as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable federal Laws governing
determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of the TiVo Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) the
TiVo Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,
would not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of
the business in which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged following
the TiVo Effective Time; and (c) the TiVo Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be able to pay their liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

the TiVo Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) make all other
payments required under this Agreement and (iv) pay all costs, fees and
expenses related to this Agreement and the Transactions, in each case,
without reliance on credit arrangements or additional financing. Rovi, Parent
and the Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are
not subject to any conditions regarding Rovis, Parents or the Merger Subs,
or any other Persons, ability to obtain financing for the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



50 4.24 Capitalization of Parent and the Merger Subs. The authorized capital
stock of TiVo Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. The
authorized capital stock of Rovi Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 250,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, none of which are issued and
outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Parent is, and immediately prior to the Rovi Effective Time will be,
owned by Rovi, and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each
Merger Sub is, and at the Rovi Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Except
as set forth in this Agreement, none of Parent or the Merger Subs has
outstanding any option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to
which any Person other than Rovi may acquire any equity security of any of
Parent or the Merger Subs. None of Parent or the Merger Subs has conducted any
business prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Rovi Effective
Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other
than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
Mergers and the other Transactions. Each of Parent and the Merger Subs have
provided true and complete copies of their respective certificates of
incorporation and by-laws to TiVo.

4.25 Certain Arrangements. There are no Contracts, agreements, arrangements
or understandings between Rovi, Parent or the Merger Subs, on the one hand,
and any member of TiVos management or directors, on the other hand, as of the
date hereof that relate in any way to TiVo or the Transactions. Prior to
the TiVo Board approving this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
Transactions for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL, neither
Rovi nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other Person, was at any time,
or became, an "interested stockholder" thereunder or has taken any action
that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the DGCL to be applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers, or any Transactions.

 

4.26 Ownership of TiVo Shares. None of Rovi, Parent or the Merger Subs nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or indirectly,
any shares of capital stock of TiVo or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of TiVo Common Stock (in each
case, other than any such shares of capital stock of TiVo or other
securities held on behalf of third parties or held in trust to fund TiVo or
Rovi obligations). There are no voting trusts or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings to which any of Rovi, Parent, the Merger Subs
or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest of Rovi or any of its
Subsidiaries nor are there any agreements, arrangements or understandings to
which Rovi, Parent, the Merger Subs or any of their respective Subsidiaries
is a party with respect to the acquisition, divestiture, retention, purchase,
sale or tendering of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest of
TiVo or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

4.27 Rights Plan. Rovi has no stockholder rights plan, stockholder rights
agreements or similar agreements with any of its stockholders.

4.28 Tax Qualification. Neither Rovi nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or
agreed to take any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably likely to
prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from being treated as an
"exchange" described in Section 351(a) of the Code or the Rovi Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 



51 4.29 No Additional Representations. Each of Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs
acknowledges that neither TiVo nor any Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, of any kind, including without limitation any

information regarding TiVo furnished or made available to Rovi, Parent, the
Merger Subs and any of their respective Representatives, in each case except
as expressly set forth in _Article III_ (as modified by the TiVo Disclosure
Schedule and the TiVo SEC Documents), and none of TiVo or its
Representatives, or any other Person shall be subject to any liability to
Rovi, Parent, the Merger Subs or any other Person resulting from TiVos making
available, or Rovis, Parents, or the Merger Subs use of, such information,
including the confidential information memorandum, management presentation and
other presentation materials delivered to Rovi, as subsequently updated,
supplemented or amended, or any information, documents or material made
available to Rovi, Parent, or the Merger Subs in the due diligence materials
provided, including in the data room, other management presentations (formal
or informal) or in any other form in connection with the Transactions and each
of Rovi, Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledges that it is not relying and
has not relied on any representations or warranties or other information
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,
except for the representations and warranties of TiVo set forth in _Article
III_.

consummate the Mergers and other Transactions, or (2) materially impair the
ability of Rovi and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to conduct their
business in ordinary course consistent with past practice;

 

(g) except as required or permitted by GAAP or as advised by Rovis regular
public independent accountant, make any change in financial accounting
methods, principles or practices materially affecting the reported
consolidated assets, liabilities or results of operations of Rovi;

 



57 (h) authorize or adopt, or publicly propose, a plan or agreement of complete
or partial liquidation or dissolution of Parent, Rovi or any of Rovis

material Tax election or file any amended material Tax Return;

 

(j) subject to _Section 5.9_, take any action (or omit to take any action) if
such action (or omission), at the time of such action (or omission), would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set
forth in _Article VI_ not being satisfied; or

 

(k) agree, resolve or commit to take any of the actions prohibited by this
_Section 5.2_.

 

5.3 Preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders Meetings.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) Rovi
and TiVo shall jointly prepare and Rovi and TiVo, as applicable, shall file
with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent to the
stockholders of Rovi relating to the Rovi Stockholders Meeting and to the
stockholders of TiVo relating to the TiVo Stockholders Meeting and (ii)
Parent and Rovi shall prepare (with TiVos reasonable cooperation) and file
with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in (A) the TiVo Merger and (B) the Rovi Merger. Prior to the Registration
Statement being declared effective, (1) Rovi shall use its reasonable best
efforts to execute and deliver to Cooley and to Skadden the applicable "Tax
Representation Letter" referenced in _Section 5.19_; and (2) TiVo shall use
its reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver to Skadden and to Cooley
the applicable "Tax Representation Letter" referenced in _Section 5.19_.
Following the delivery of the Tax Representation Letters pursuant to the
preceding sentence, (x) Rovi shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Cooley to deliver to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of
Item 601 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act; and (y) TiVo shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Skadden to deliver to it a tax
opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act. In rendering such opinions, each of such counsel shall be
entitled to rely on the Tax Representation Letters referred to in this
_Section 5.3(a)_ and _Section 5.19_. Each of Rovi and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing
(including by responding to comments of the SEC), and, prior to the effective
date of the Registration Statement, Rovi and Parent shall take all action
reasonably required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction
in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service
of process in any such jurisdiction) to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock. Rovi
and TiVo shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the
other Principal Party in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. As promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective,
each of Rovi and TiVo shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its

 



58  respective stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by
Parent, Rovi or TiVo, in each case without providing the other Parties with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the TiVo Effective Time any information relating to Parent, Rovi or TiVo, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by Rovi, Parent or TiVo which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Rovi and TiVo. Each Party shall notify the others promptly of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, of the issuance
of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Filings or the Mergers.

(b) TiVo shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of
the Registration Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _TiVo Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the TiVo Stockholder Approval. If the TiVo Board has not
made a TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change, TiVo shall, through the TiVo
Board, make the TiVo Recommendation, include such TiVo Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the TiVo Merger, and (ii) take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the TiVo Stockholder Approval.
Except as expressly permitted in  _Sections 5.4(b)_ and _5.4(d)_ , neither
the TiVo Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) withhold, withdraw or
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Rovi, the approval, determination of
advisability, or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee
of this Agreement, the Mergers, and the other Transactions, (B) make any other
public statement in connection with the TiVo Stockholders Meeting by or on
behalf of the TiVo Board that would reasonably be expected to have the same
effect or (C) approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal ((A), (B) and (C), until and unless retracted or reversed,
being referred to as a " _TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if on the date the TiVo Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, TiVo has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of TiVo Common Stock to obtain the TiVo Stockholder Approval,
TiVo shall have the right to make one or more postponements or adjournments of
the TiVo Stockholders Meeting; provided that the TiVo Stockholders Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date
for which the TiVo Stockholders Meeting was, at the time of such postponement
or adjournment, scheduled to 

 



59  be held or reconvened, as applicable and (y) TiVo may postpone or adjourn
the TiVo Stockholders Meeting if TiVo has provided a written notice to Rovi
pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_ that it intends to make a TiVo Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal, until a date
that is five (5) Business Days after the deadline contemplated by _Section
5.4(b)_ with respect to such notice or subsequent notices if the Takeover
Proposal is modified during such five (5) Business Day period. Absent a TiVo
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the obligations of the Parties hereunder shall
continue in full force and effect and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
TiVo stockholders at the TiVo Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting
on adopting this Agreement.

 

(c) Rovi shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders (the " _Rovi Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
seeking the Rovi Stockholder Approval. If the Rovi Board has not made a Rovi
Adverse Recommendation Change, Rovi shall, through the Rovi Board, make the
Rovi Recommendation, include such Rovi Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and use its reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
the Transactions, including the Rovi Merger and (ii) take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the Rovi Stockholder Approval. Except as
expressly permitted in _Sections 5.4(b)_ and _5.4(d)_ , neither the Rovi Board
nor any committee thereof shall (A) withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify,
or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to TiVo, the approval, determination of advisability, or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of this
Agreement, the Mergers, and the other Transactions, (B) make any other public
statement in connection with the Rovi Stockholders Meeting by or on behalf of
the Rovi Board that would reasonably be expected to have the same effect or
(C) approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any Takeover Proposal ((A),
(B) and (C), until and unless retracted or reversed, being referred to as a "
_Rovi Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if
on the date the Rovi Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Rovi has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Rovi Common Stock to
obtain the Rovi Stockholder Approval, Rovi shall have the right to make one or
more postponements or adjournments of the Rovi Stockholders Meeting; provided
that the Rovi Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date
that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Rovi Stockholders
Meeting was, at the time of such postponement or adjournment, scheduled to be
held or reconvened, as applicable and (y) Rovi may postpone or adjourn the
Rovi Stockholders Meeting if Rovi has provided a written notice to TiVo
pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_ that it intends to make a Rovi Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal, until a date
that is five (5) Business Days after the deadline contemplated by _Section
5.4(b)_ with respect to such notice or subsequent notices if the Takeover
Proposal is modified during such five (5) Business Day period. Absent a Rovi
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the obligations of the Parties hereunder shall
continue in full force and effect and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
Rovi stockholders at the Rovi Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting
on adopting this Agreement.

 



60 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties shall
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to hold the TiVo Stockholders
Meeting and the Rovi Stockholders Meeting on the same day.

5.4 No Solicitation; No-Shop.

(a) Each of TiVo and Rovi shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal (as hereinafter defined) and shall seek to have returned to TiVo or
Rovi any confidential information that has been provided in any such
discussions or negotiations. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
TiVo Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article VII_ , each of TiVo and Rovi shall not, nor shall it permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
or Representatives retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other
action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal, (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential information or data to any
Person in relation to a Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (v) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, business combination agreement, option agreement or
other similar agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (excluding any
confidentiality agreements entered into in connection with any
Takeover Proposal) or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing
related to any Takeover Proposal; _provided, however,_ that (x) Rovi or TiVo,
as applicable, may ascertain facts from the party making such Takeover
Proposal for the sole purpose of the TiVo Board or the Rovi Board, as
applicable, informing itself about the Takeover Proposal and the party that
made it and (y) if, prior to obtaining the TiVo Stockholder Approval (in the
case of TiVo) or the Rovi Stockholder Approval (in the case of Rovi),
following the receipt of a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or a
proposal which is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal that in
either case was not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or
knowingly encouraged in violation of clause (i) above, the TiVo Board or the
Rovi Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that a failure to take action with respect to such
Takeover Proposal, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to TiVos stockholders or Rovis stockholders, as applicable, under
applicable Law, TiVo or Rovi may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, as
applicable, and subject to compliance with _Section 5.4(c)_, (A) furnish
information with respect to TiVo or Rovi, as applicable, to the party making
such Takeover Proposal and its respective Representatives pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions not less favorable to TiVo
or Rovi, as the case may be, than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (as it had been modified by the letter agreement by and between TiVo
and Rovi dated March 25, 2016) and that in any event does not prohibit or
restrain the making of a Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that (1) such
confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an
exclusive right to negotiate with TiVo or Rovi, as applicable, and (2) TiVo
advises Rovi or Rovi advises TiVo, as applicable, of all such nonpublic
information delivered to such Person substantially concurrently with its
delivery to the requesting party and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such party and its Representatives regarding such Takeover
Proposal. Each of TiVo and Rovi agrees not to waive or fail to enforce any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party relating to a potential or actual Takeover Proposal.

 



61 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including _Section
5.3_ but subject to compliance with this _Section 5.4_, prior to receipt of
the TiVo Stockholder Approval, the TiVo Board may, or, prior to receipt of the
Rovi Stockholder Approval, the Rovi Board may, in response to any Takeover
Proposal, effect a TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change or Rovi Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, and subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.4(b)_ and _Section 7.3(f)_, as applicable, terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into a binding agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal, if (i) the TiVo Board or the Rovi Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with TiVos or Rovis outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; (ii) the TiVo Board or the Rovi Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with TiVos or Rovis outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make a TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change or Rovi Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of TiVo or Rovi under applicable Laws; (iii) the board effecting
the recommendation change, or seeking to terminate the Agreement as provided
above, provides the other Principal Party five (5) Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include the
information with respect to such Superior Proposal that is specified in
_Section 5.4(c)_, as well as a copy of such Takeover Proposal; (iv) during
the five (5) Business Days following such written notice (or such shorter
period as is specified below), the board effecting the recommendation change
and, if requested by other Principal Party, its Representatives have
negotiated in good faith with the other Principal Party regarding any
revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by the other Principal
Party in response to such Superior Proposal; and (v) at the end of the five
(5) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (iv), the TiVo Board
or Rovi Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with TiVos or
Rovis outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement to which the
other Principal Party has agreed in writing), that the Takeover Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make a TiVo
Adverse Recommendation Change or Rovi Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the exercise by the TiVo Board or Rovi Board of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of TiVo or Rovi under applicable Laws.
Any material amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Takeover Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.4_; _provided,
however,_ that the notice period pursuant to clause (iii) above and the
period during which the board effecting the recommendation change and its
Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith with the other
Principal Party regarding any revisions to the terms of the
Transactions proposed by the other Principal Party in response to such new
Takeover Proposal pursuant to clause (v) above shall expire on the later to
occur of (x) three (3) Business Days after the board effecting the TiVo
Adverse Recommendation Change or Rovi Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, provides written notice of such new Takeover Proposal to the other
Principal Party and (y) the end of the original five (5) Business Day period
described in clause (v) above; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the
delivery of the notice by a Party pursuant to clause (iii) above nor any
public announcement thereof that such Party determines that it is required to
make under applicable Law shall constitute a TiVo Adverse Recommendation
Change or Rovi Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, unless and until
such Party shall have failed at or prior to the end of the period referred to
in clause (iv) above to publicly announce that it (A) was

 



62  recommending the Transactions and (B) has determined that such other
Takeover Proposal (taking into account (1) any modifications or adjustments
made to the Transactions and agreed to by the Parties and (2) any
modifications or adjustments made to such other Takeover Proposal) is not a
Superior Proposal and has publicly rejected such Takeover Proposal. Upon the
occurrence of the failure described in the immediately preceding proviso,
such notice and such public announcement shall constitute a TiVo Adverse
Recommendation Change or Rovi Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of TiVo and Rovi set forth in _Sections
5.4(a)_ and _5.4(b)_ , TiVo or Rovi shall promptly, and in any event no later
than 24-hours after it receives any Takeover Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry that such Party reasonably believes could
lead to a Takeover Proposal, advise the other Principal Party orally and
in writing of any request for confidential information in connection with a
Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person
making such request or Takeover Proposal and shall keep the other Principal
Party promptly advised of all changes to the material terms of any Takeover
Proposal. Each of TiVo and Rovi agrees that subject to applicable restrictions
under Laws applicable to TiVo or Rovi and their respective Subsidiaries, it
shall, prior to or concurrent with the time it is provided to any third
parties, provide to the other Principal Party any non-public information
concerning TiVo or Rovi and their respective Subsidiaries that TiVo or Rovi
provided to any third party in connection with any Takeover Proposal which was
not previously provided to the other Principal Party.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the TiVo Board or
Rovi Board from effecting a TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change or Rovi
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, if (and only if) it is in
response to, or as a result of, an Intervening Event and the TiVo Board or
Rovi Board, as applicable, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
concludes in good faith, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
TiVo or Rovi, as applicable, under applicable Laws.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Rovi Board or the
TiVo Board from (i) taking and disclosing to their stockholders of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to their
stockholders if the TiVo Board or Rovi Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its duties to the stockholders of TiVo
or Rovi under applicable Laws; or (iii) making accurate disclosure to their
stockholders of factual information regarding the business, financial
condition or results of operations of Rovi or TiVo or the fact that a Takeover
Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the
material terms of such proposal (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be
a Rovi Adverse Recommendation Change or a TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change,
as applicable), so long as (A) any such disclosure includes the Rovi
Recommendation or the TiVo Recommendation, as applicable, without any
modification or qualification thereof or continues the prior recommendation of
the Rovi Board or TiVo Board, as the case may be, and (B) does not contain
either an express Rovi Adverse Recommendation Change (without giving effect to
clause (B) of the definition thereof)

 



63  or an express TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change (without giving effect to
clause (B) of the definition thereof), as applicable, or any other statements
by or on behalf of the Board of Directors of such Party which would
reasonably be expected to have the same effect as a Rovi Adverse
Recommendation Change or a TiVo Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person (other than TiVo, Rovi, Parent and their Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
(A) 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including equity interests in
Subsidiaries) of TiVo or Rovi, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (B) 20% or more of any class of equity securities or voting power of
TiVo or Rovi, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities or voting power of TiVo or Rovi, or (D) any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend
or self-tender offer, liquidation, dissolution, or similar
transaction involving TiVo or Rovi or any of their Subsidiaries, other than
the Transactions.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal from
any Person (other than TiVo, Rovi and their Subsidiaries) providing for the
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the consolidated
assets (including equity interests in Subsidiaries) of TiVo or Rovi and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 50% or more of any class of equity
securities or voting power of TiVo or Rovi, any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 50%
or more of any class of equity securities or voting power of TiVo or Rovi, or
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
TiVo or Rovi or any of their Subsidiaries (other than the Transactions) for
which the third party has demonstrated that the financing for such offer is
fully committed or is reasonably likely to be obtained, in each case as
determined by the TiVo Board or the Rovi Board in its good faith judgment
(after receiving the advice of independent financial advisors and outside
counsel) and which the TiVo Board or Rovi Board, as applicable, has determined
in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms, and, if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to TiVo or Rovi, as applicable, and their
respective stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions.

 

5.5 Takeover Statute. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become
applicable to this Agreement and the Transactions after the date hereof, each
of Rovi and TiVo and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
Mergers and the other Transactions. Nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall be
construed to permit a Party to this Agreement to do any act that
would otherwise constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of
the rights of another Party under, any other provision of this Agreement.

 



64 5.6 Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the execution of
this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to Rovi
and TiVo. Thereafter, Rovi (unless the Rovi Board has made a Rovi Adverse
Recommendation Change) and TiVo (unless the TiVo Board has made a TiVo Adverse
Recommendation Change) will consult with the other Principal Party before
either Principal Party or any of their respective Representatives (a)
participates in any media interviews, (b) engages in meetings or calls with
analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons or (c) provides
any statements which are public or are reasonably likely to become public, in
any such case to the extent relating to the Transactions (a " _Public
Statement_ "), except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in
which case the Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to consult with
the other Principal Party in advance of any such media interviews, meetings
or calls or statements. In addition, unless the Rovi Board has made a Rovi
Adverse Recommendation Change or the TiVo Board has made a TiVo Adverse
Recommendation Change, Rovi and TiVo agree to cause their respective
directors and executives officers to refrain from taking any position in any
such Public Statement that is (x) contrary to the positions previously taken
by TiVo and Rovi with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Mergers, or (y) reasonably likely to have a significant,
adverse impact on the ability of the Parties to consummate the Transactions.
The executive officers of Rovi and TiVo will direct their respective
employees, Representatives and Subsidiaries to comply with this _Section
5.6_.

5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. Each Party shall give prompt notice to
the other Parties if any of the following occur after the date of this
Agreement: (i) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from
any Person alleging that the consent or approval of such third party is or may
be required in connection with the Transactions; (ii) receipt of any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Entity, NASDAQ or any other
securities market in connection with the Transactions; or (iii) such Party
becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could materially prevent or
delay the consummation of the Transactions or that would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set forth in
_Article VI_ not being satisfied; _provided, however,_  that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies of TiVo, Rovi, Parent or the Merger Subs available hereunder and
no information delivered pursuant to this  _Section 5.7_ shall update any
section of the TiVo Disclosure Schedule or the Rovi Disclosure Schedule.

5.8 Access to Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Rovi, Parent and TiVo shall cause each of its and
their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to its and their Representatives,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Times,
reasonable access (including for the purpose of coordinating transition
planning with employees, but not for purposes of conducting environmental site
assessments) to all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts,
commitments and records (including TiVos Tax records), and to its and their
Representatives and, during such period, each Principal Party shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly make available to the other Principal
Party, subject, in the case of competitively sensitive information, to
any customary "clean-room" arrangements agreed between the Principal Parties,
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other Principal Party may reasonably
request.

 



65 (b) No investigation by any of the Parties or their respective Representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any
other Party set forth herein.

(c) This _Section 5.8_ shall not require either Principal Party or any of
its Subsidiaries to permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable, good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel) of such Principal Party would reasonably be expected
to result in (i) any violation of any material Contract or Law to which such
Principal Party is a party or is subject or cause any privilege (including
attorney-client privilege) which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries would
be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information and
such undermining of such privilege could in such Principal Partys good faith
judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)
adversely affect in any material respect such Principal Partys position in
any pending or, what such Principal Party believes in good faith (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if such Principal Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and the other Principal Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, such information being
reasonably pertinent thereto;  _provided_ , that, in the cases of clause (i),
the Principal Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (1) would not (in the
good faith belief of the disclosing Principal Party (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the
violation of any such material Contract or Law or reasonably be likely to
cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (2)
could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the disclosing Principal Party
(after consultation with counsel which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-
employee Representatives of the non-disclosing Principal Party shall be
provided access to such information; _provided, further,_ that the disclosing
Principal Party shall (x) notify the other Principal Party that such
disclosures are reasonably likely to violate the disclosing Principal Partys
or its Subsidiaries obligations under any such material Contract or Law or

date of this Agreement, the Transactions, including using reasonable best
efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the Transactions
and using reasonable best efforts to defend any Proceeding seeking to enjoin,
prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions or seeking material

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each Party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof,
unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, and to supply as promptly as

efforts to (x) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes
applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action reasonable to enable
the Transactions to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the Transactions.

 



67 (d) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with (A) determining whether
any filing or submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any Proceeding relating to the
Transactions, including any Proceeding initiated by a private party, is
required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are

given by a private party in connection with any Proceeding, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Rovi or Parent shall have the right to direct all
matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ that each of the Parties shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult

contained in this Agreement, Rovi, after prior consultation with TiVo to the
extent practicable and good faith consideration of its views, shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition clearances, including in
connection with the determination of any Regulatory Actions with participation
from TiVo, and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Entity and TiVo in connection with obtaining any necessary
antitrust or competition clearances. Rovi and TiVo may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this  _Section 5.9(d)_ as "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside antitrust counsel to employees, officers,
directors or other Representatives of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (TiVo or Rovi, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 5.9(d)_, materials provided to another Party or its outside
counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation, pricing
and other competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective in the
Contracts of the Parties and their respective Subsidiaries.

 



68 (e) Notwithstanding _Sections 5.9(a)_ through _5.9(d)_ or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Rovi or Parent or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to agree to (nor shall TiVo and its
Subsidiaries, without Rovis prior written consent, propose or commit to any
third party that it or Rovi or Parent or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates)
(i) divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, encumber or allow
a third party to utilize, any portion of its or their respective businesses,
assets or Contracts or (ii) take any other action that may be required or
requested by any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining the
consents, authorizations, orders or approvals contemplated by this _Section
5.9_ that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), would have an adverse impact,
in any material respect, on (A) the business of Rovi and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or (B) the business of TiVo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (each a " _Regulatory Action_ ").

(a) From and after the Effective Times, Parent shall (and shall cause TiVo and
Rovi to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, (i) to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (without limitation to clause (ii) below), and
shall advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder, and (ii) to the same
extent that such persons are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Rovi and TiVo as in effect as of
the date hereof or in any Contract of the applicable Party or its respective
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director,
officer or employee of TiVo, Rovi and their respective Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Times, including the Transactions, in such
Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer or employee of Rovi or TiVo or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or in such Indemnitees capacity as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request or for the benefit of Rovi or TiVo, before the
Effective Times (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons
serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of Rovi or TiVo).

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Times (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or actions contemplated
hereby) now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of Rovi or TiVo or any of their respective Subsidiaries as provided
in their respective certificates of incorporation, by-laws or other
organizational documents shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance

 



69  with their terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years from the
Effective Times, Parent shall cause Rovi and TiVo to, and the Rovi Surviving
Corporation and the TiVo Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
applicable Partys certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any
Contract of the applicable Party or its respective Subsidiaries with any of
their respective directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Times were
current or former directors, officers or employees of Rovi or TiVo or their
respective Subsidiaries;  _provided, however,_ that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

(c) In the event that either Parent or the applicable Surviving Corporation or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the applicable Surviving Corporation to, cause
proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.10_.

(d) Prior to the TiVo Effective Time, TiVo may obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of no more than six (6) years from
and after the TiVo Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as TiVos current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance with benefits and levels of coverage not materially more favorable
than TiVos existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the TiVo Effective Time (including with respect to acts and
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or
actions contemplated hereby) and, if such policies have been obtained, Parent
shall, and shall cause the TiVo Surviving Corporation to maintain such
policies in full force and effect after the TiVo Effective Time; _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall Parent, TiVo or the TiVo Surviving
Corporation expend for such "tail" policies a premium amount greater than the
product of the cost of the annual premium of TiVos policy in existence as of
the date of this Agreement multiplied by the number of years covered by such
"tail" policy. Parent shall cause each of the Rovi Surviving Corporation and
if, as of the TiVo Effective Time, TiVo shall not have obtained the "tail"
policies described in the previous sentence, the TiVo Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, to provide the current and former directors and officers
of TiVo and Rovi with an insurance and indemnification policy (from an
insurance carrier or insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating
as the current insurers) that provides directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for events, acts and
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Times for an aggregate period
of no less than six (6) years from the Effective Times that is not materially
less favorable than each Partys existing policy or, if such coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall Parent or the TiVo Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies an annual premium amount greater than 300% of TiVos policy in
existence as of the date of this Agreement.

 



70 (e) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the applicable Partys certificate of
incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents in effect as of
the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the applicable Party or its
respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
obligations of Parent and TiVo under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this  _Section 5.10_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Rovi
or TiVo or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.10_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement that may be deemed to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement (a) shall, directly or indirectly, give
Rovi or TiVo or their respective Subsidiaries control over the other Partys

Effective Times, and control over all such matters shall remain in the hands

such patents, of either Rovi or its Subsidiaries or TiVo or its Subsidiaries
with respect to or under the patents of the other Party or its Subsidiaries
before or after the Effective Times. For each of clauses (a) and (b) above,
the term Subsidiary shall only include an entity for so long as such entity
is a Subsidiary.

5.12 Employee Benefit Plans. 

(a) With respect to each employee of TiVo and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Times (each such employee, a " _Covered Employee_ "), for a period
of twelve (12) months following the Effective Times, Parent shall, or shall
cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, provide to each Covered Employee (i) a base
salary or wage rate (as applicable) and annual company bonus plan opportunity
that are no less favorable to each Covered Employee than in effect for such
Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Times and (ii) health and
welfare benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to such
Covered Employee than the health and welfare benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Rovi immediately prior to the Effective Times.

 



71 (b) Following the Effective Times, Parent shall, or shall cause Rovi and its
Affiliates and any successors thereto to, assume, honor, fulfill and
discharge TiVos and its Subsidiaries obligations under the agreements listed

(c) As of the Effective Times, Parent shall waive, subject to any legal
limitation, or shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and Rovis and
TiVos third party insurance providers or third party administrators to waive,
all limitations as to any pre-existing condition or waiting periods in its
applicable welfare plans with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each Covered Employee under any welfare
plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Times, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Times under any comparable employee benefit plan. In addition,
while giving effect to _Sections 5.12(a)_ and _5.12(b)_ , as of the Effective
Times, the Covered Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Rovi
ESPP on the same terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of
Parent, Rovi and their respective Affiliates, and Parent shall, and shall
cause Rovi and TiVo to, give Covered Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (including for purposes of paid-
time off, severance and short-term disability benefits, but not for benefit
accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee
benefit and compensation plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or any of
its Affiliates for such Covered Employees service with Rovi, TiVo or any of
their respective Affiliates to the same extent that such service was credited
for purposes of any comparable employee benefit plan immediately prior to the
Effective Times and in no event shall service prior to the Effective Times be
required to be taken into account if such service credit would result in the
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period.

(d) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date that TiVo and Rovi
become part of the same controlled group pursuant to Sections 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code (the " _Controlled Group Date_ "), TiVo shall,

(e) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control", "change of
control" or term of similar import within the meaning of each TiVo Benefit
Plan will occur upon the TiVo Effective Time.

 

(f) At Rovis reasonable request, TiVo shall provide periodic updates with
respect to the negotiation, execution, adoption, amendment or termination of
any collective bargaining Contract to which TiVo is a party.

(g) No provision of this _Section 5.12_ shall be construed as a limitation
on the right of Parent, or to cause Rovi, TiVo and their respective Affiliates
to, amend or terminate any specific TiVo Benefit Plan or Rovi Benefit Plan
that TiVo or Rovi would otherwise have under the terms of such TiVo Benefit
Plan or Rovi Benefit Plan, or shall any provision of this _Section 5.12_ be
construed to require the continuation of the employment of any particular
Covered Employee. The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are solely for the
benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor or any other person shall be a
third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.12_ of this Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any TiVo Benefit Plan or
Rovi Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any
purpose.

that the date of such determination is the Closing Date) and (ii) is
incapable of being cured by Rovi by the Outside Date (as the same may be

breach of this Agreement by the other Principal Party or of any rights of
such Principal Party in respect thereof. The Termination Fee, if paid, shall
not be credited against any damages recovered by the payee arising from a
breach of this Agreement by the payor. Notwithstanding anything to the

Termination Fee be paid more than once by each Principal Party or (ii) shall
anyone be paid an aggregate amount pursuant to _Sections 7.3(a)-(f)_ in

Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement or

such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that it will
