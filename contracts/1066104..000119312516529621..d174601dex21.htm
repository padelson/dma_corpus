\- iii - STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of
April 4, 2016, by and among (i) CEB Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Purchaser_ "), (ii) CXO Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Seller_ "), (iii), CXO Acquisition Co., a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller (" _CXO Midco_ "), and (iv)
Sports Leadership Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Seller (" _SL Midco_ ", together with CXO Midco, the " _Company
Entities_ " and each, a " _Company Entity_ "). The Purchaser, the Seller, CXO
Midco and SL Midco are each referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined have the meanings set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto and the
contents of such Schedule I are deemed incorporated herein by reference in
their entirety and shall constitute part of this Agreement for all purposes.

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding Company Entity
Shares; and

 

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser
desires to acquire from the Seller, all of the issued and outstanding Company
Entity Shares, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

AGREEMENTS

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants,
representations and warranties contained herein and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES

 

1.1 _Sale and Purchase of Company Entity Shares_. On the terms and subject to
the conditions contained herein, on the Closing Date, the Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall
purchase, acquire and accept from the Seller, the Company Entity Shares free
and clear of all Liens (other than (i) those Liens created or caused by
Purchaser and (ii) restrictions on transfer pursuant to federal, state or
local securities Laws).

1.2 _Purchase Price_. As consideration for the purchase of the Company Entity
Shares, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the Aggregate Purchase Price,
payable as set forth in _Section 2.3_ , and subject to adjustments as set
forth in _Section 1.3_ and _Section 1.4_ (which such adjustments, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be settled solely in accordance with the terms of
_Section 1.3_ and _Section 1.4_ and shall not be subject to the limitations
set forth in _Article VIII_ ). For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the
Purchaser is obligated to make payments under this Agreement to the Seller,
including with respect to the Aggregate Purchase Price, payable as set forth
in _Section 2.3_ , and any adjustments as set forth in _Section 1.3_ and
_Section 1.4_ , the  Purchaser shall satisfy its obligations under this Agreement by making
payments to the Seller (or as otherwise directed by the Seller) and shall have
no responsibility or liability whatsoever in respect of any distribution by
the Seller (or at the Sellers direction) to the Sellers stakeholders of any
amounts received by the Seller (or receivable by the Seller but directed by
the Seller to be paid to any other Person), whether pursuant to the terms of
the Sellers Governing Documents or otherwise, it being agreed that the amount
and timing of all such distributions shall be the sole responsibility of the
Seller.

 

1.3 _Estimated_ _Aggregate Purchase Price_. No later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "), prepared in good faith,
setting forth (a) an estimate of (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount (and related Net Working Capital Adjustment), (ii) the Closing Cash,
(iii) the Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ") and
(iv) the Selling Expenses (the " _Estimated Selling Expenses_ ") and (b) on
the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Aggregate Purchase Price
(such amount, the " _Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price_ "), together with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The Estimated Closing Statement
and all of the calculations set forth therein shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with past practices and the Agreed
Accounting Principles.

 

1.4 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Seller, as
soon as practicable, but in no event more than forty-five (45) days after the
Closing Date, a preliminary statement prepared in good faith and in the same
form as the Estimated Closing Statement (the " _Preliminary Statement_ ")
setting forth (i) the calculation of (A) the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount, (B) the Closing Cash, (C) the Closing Indebtedness and (D) the Selling
Expenses, along with reasonable supporting detail to evidence the calculations
of such amounts and (ii) on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the
Aggregate Purchase Price. The Preliminary Statement and all of the
calculations set forth therein shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with past practices and the Agreed Accounting
Principles.

 

(b) The Seller shall have forty-five (45) days to review the Preliminary
Statement from the date of its receipt thereof (the " _Review Period_ ").
During the Review Period, the Seller shall have reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books and records, personnel and advisors of each
Company Entity and its Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably required in
connection with such review. If the Seller objects to any aspect of the
Preliminary Statement, the Seller must deliver a written notice of such
objection (the " _Objection Notice_ ") to the Purchaser on or prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail those items or amounts in the Preliminary Statement as to which the
Seller disagrees (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If the Seller delivers an
Objection Notice to the Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Review Period
as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _1.4(b)_ , the Purchaser and the Seller
shall, for a period of thirty (30) days thereafter (the " _Resolution Period_
"), attempt in good faith to resolve the matters contained therein, and any
written resolution, signed by each of the Purchaser and the Seller, as to any
such matter shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all
purposes hereunder. In the event the Seller does not deliver an Objection
Notice to the Purchaser as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _1.4(b)_ prior to
the expiration of the Review 

 



\- 2 -  Period, the Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to the Preliminary
Statement in its entirety, which Preliminary Statement (and the calculations
and amounts therein) or undisputed portions thereof (as the case may be) (and
the corresponding Final Statement and Final Aggregate Purchase Price
calculated on the basis thereof) shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-
appealable for all purposes hereunder.

 

(c) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, the Purchaser and the
Seller have not reached an agreement with respect to all disputed matters
contained in the Objection Notice, then within ten (10) Business Days
thereafter, the Purchaser and the Seller shall submit for resolution those of
such matters remaining in dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or if such
firm is unavailable or unwilling to so serve, to a mutually acceptable
nationally recognized independent accounting firm (as the case may be, the "
_Neutral Arbitrator_ "). The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to
resolve (based solely on the written presentations of the Purchaser and the
Seller and not by independent review) only those matters submitted to it in
accordance with the first sentence of this _Section_ _ _ _1.4(c)_. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall direct the Neutral Arbitrator to render a
resolution of all such disputed matters within thirty (30) days after its
engagement or such other period agreed upon in writing by the Purchaser and
the Seller. The resolution of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to each of the Purchaser and the Seller and shall
be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder,
absent fraud or manifest error. The Preliminary Statement, once modified
and/or agreed to in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _1.4(b)_ and/or this
_Section_ _ _ _1.4(c)_ , shall become the " _Final Statement_ ," and the
calculation of Aggregate Purchase Price on the basis of the calculations and
amounts set forth in the Final Statement is referred to as the " _Final
Aggregate Purchase Price_."

 

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work performed by the Neutral
Arbitrator shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller,
on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by such Party, as determined by the Neutral Arbitrator. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by
the Parties in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the
Neutral Arbitrator shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and
expense.

 

(e) If the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds the Final Aggregate
Purchase Price (the amount of such excess, the " _Downward Adjustment Amount_
"), then the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly execute and deliver a
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to (i) make a disbursement of the
Downward Adjustment Amount to the Purchaser, first, from the Working Capital
Escrow Amount, and, to the extent the Downward Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Working Capital Escrow Amount, thereafter from the Indemnity Escrow Amount,
and (ii) make a the disbursement of the remaining amount of the Working
Capital Escrow Amount, if any, to the Seller (or one or more accounts
designated by the Seller).

(f) If the Final Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price (the amount of such excess, the " _Upward Adjustment Amount_
"), then (i) the Purchaser shall pay, within three (3) Business Days after the
date on which the Preliminary Statement becomes the Final Statement, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to the Seller (or one or more
accounts designated by the Seller) an amount equal to the Upward

 



\- 3 -  Adjustment Amount, and (ii) the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly
execute and deliver a written instruction to the Escrow Agent to make a
disbursement of the Working Capital Escrow Amount to the Seller (or one or
more accounts designated by the Seller).

1.5 _Escrow Accounts_. The Escrow Amounts to be deposited with the Escrow
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ shall each be held in an escrow account
(the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ " and the " _Working Capital Escrow Account_
," respectively, and, collectively, the " _Escrow Accounts_ ") in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnity
Escrow Amount shall be released and paid on the twelve (12) month anniversary
of Closing (the " _Escrow Termination Date_ ") in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each Party agrees that for all Tax
purposes: (i) the right of the Seller to the Escrow Amounts shall be treated
as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for installment treatment
under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign,
state or local Law, as appropriate, (ii) the Purchaser shall be treated as the
owner of the Escrow Accounts, and all interest and earnings earned from the
investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amounts, if any, or any portion
thereof, shall be allocable to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 468B(g) of
the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8, (iii) if and to
the extent any amount of the Escrow Amounts is actually distributed to the
Seller, interest may be imputed on such amount payable to the Seller, as
required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code, and (iv) in the event that the
total amount of any interest and earnings on the portion of the Escrow Amounts
that is paid to the Seller exceeds the imputed interest, such interest shall
be treated as interest or other income and not as purchase price. Clause (iv)
of the preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the right of the Seller
to the Escrow Amounts and any interest and earnings earned thereon is not
treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price under
Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
No Party shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with the
foregoing.

 

1.6 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Purchaser, the Company Entities, and the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts required to be deducted
and withheld from such Person with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of state, local or foreign law relating to Taxes; provided,
that the Purchaser, the Company Entities or the Escrow Agent, as applicable,
shall use reasonable efforts to give reasonable advance notice to the Seller
prior to any such withholding other than with respect to the Sales Bonus or
Taxes imposed as a result of a failure to deliver applicable Tax forms. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Purchaser or, if applicable, the
Company Entities or the Escrow Agent, and are remitted to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(c) _Selling Expenses_. At the Closing, the Purchaser will pay (or cause to be

(d) _Indebtedness_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be

to be repaid at the Closing and as set forth on _Schedule 2.3(d)_ , in cash an
amount equal to such Estimated Closing Indebtedness owed to such Person, as
specified in a payoff letter received from such Person or Persons in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser (such payoff letter to specify the
amount that, if paid on the Closing Date, would be sufficient to discharge all
liabilities thereunder and, where applicable, to include customary

seeking to terminate pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall have used
reasonable best efforts pursuant to _Section 6.1_ to have any such Order
vacated or lifted); or

 



\- 6 - (d) by the Purchaser, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

the Purchaser to the Seller and each Company Entity and attached hereto as
_Schedule III_ (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ") the Purchaser hereby
represents and warrants to the Seller and each Company Entity as follows:

 

5.1 _Organization_. The Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business
as now conducted and to own or lease and operate its properties and assets,
and is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing (as
applicable), as a foreign entity under the laws of each jurisdiction where
such qualification is necessary, except for where such failures to be so
qualified would not reasonably be expected to impair or delay the Purchasers
ability to consummate the Transaction.

 



\- 24 - 5.2 _Authority and Validity_. The Purchaser has the requisite power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each Transaction
Document to which the Purchaser is a party and to consummate the Transaction.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Transaction Document to
which the Purchaser is a party and the consummation of the Transaction have
been duly and validly authorized by the Purchaser, and no other proceedings on
the part of the Purchaser are necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the Transaction. This Agreement and each Transaction Document to
which Purchaser is a party has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Purchaser and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other Parties hereto) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by the General Enforceability Exceptions.

 

5.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. No notices to, filings with, or
authorizations, consents or approvals of, any Governmental Entity are
necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by the Purchaser of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents to which the Purchaser is a party or
the consummation by the Purchaser of the Transaction, except for
(i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and (ii) those the failure
of which to obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the performance by Purchaser of its obligations
under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents to which Purchaser is a
party or the consummation of the Transaction. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement does not, and the consummation
of the Transaction by the Purchaser, will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination or cancellation under, any
provision of (a) the Governing Documents of the Purchaser, (b) any applicable
Laws or applicable Orders; or (c) any Contract to which the Purchaser is a
party or by which the Purchaser is bound or to which any of the Purchasers
properties or assets is subject, other than, in the case of clauses (b) and

ability to consummate the Transactions.

executed commitments in respect of additional borrowings under its existing
credit facilities, which borrowings are subject to customary funding
conditions. The Purchaser will have on the Closing Date, sufficient funds to
be able to pay in full the amounts payable by the Purchaser pursuant to 
_Section 2.3_ and any expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with
the Transaction, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligation of the
Purchaser to consummate the Transaction is not contingent on the Purchasers
ability to complete any debt or equity financing transaction prior to the
Closing.

 



\- 25 - 5.5 _Brokers_. Except as set forth in the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule,
all negotiations relating to this Agreement and the Transaction have been
carried on without the intervention of any Person acting on behalf of the
Purchaser in such manner as to give rise to any valid claim against the
Seller, the Company Entities and/or their respective Subsidiaries for any
brokerage or finders commission, fee, or similar compensation.

5.6  _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending that relate to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, threatened, against or affecting the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates that challenges the validity or enforceability of this Agreement

equitable relief with respect to, the Transaction or that would reasonably be
expected to impair or delay the Purchasers ability to consummate the
Transaction.

sophisticated Person, and has engaged expert advisors experienced in the
evaluation and acquisition of companies such as the Company Entities and their
Subsidiaries as contemplated hereunder. The Purchaser has undertaken
such investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated such
documents and information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an

in _Article III_ or _Article_ _ _ _IV,_ any certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.2(a)(i)_ or Section 2 of the Indemnity Support Agreement and (b)
the Purchaser has not relied, nor will it rely, upon any of the information

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

6.1 _Further Assurances_ _; HSR_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, during the period from the date of this
Agreement until the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement
(the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), the Parties shall each use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Transaction as promptly as practicable; (b) obtain from any
Governmental Entity or any other third party any Consents or Orders required
to be obtained or made by the Parties in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and
the consummation of the Transaction, including those set forth on  _Schedule_
_ _ _4.1(c)(i)_ ; (c) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings,
and thereafter make and cooperate with the other Parties with respect to any
other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transaction required under (i) any applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign
securities Laws, (ii) the HSR Act and any related governmental request
thereunder (it being agreed that the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts
to make the necessary filing with the appropriate Governmental Entity in
accordance with the HSR Act within ten (10) Business Days after the execution
of this Agreement and shall seek early termination with respect thereto) and
any similar non-U.S. competition notifications that the Parties mutually
agree are reasonably necessary, and (iii) any other applicable Law; and (d)
execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the Transaction in accordance with the terms hereof. The Parties
shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such
filings. For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent it results in a
failure to satisfy a closing condition set forth in  _Article VII_ , the
failure to obtain any Consent or Order (including those set forth on
_Schedule_ _ _ _4.1(c)_ ) shall not serve as the basis for the Purchaser to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _2.4_ provided that the
Company Entities have used reasonable best efforts to obtain such Consent or
Order pursuant to this _Section 6.1_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
agree to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain consent of all
Governmental Entities, including the United States Federal Trade Commission ("
_FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("
_DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity acting under the HSR Act, and of
any other Person (other than a Governmental Entity) necessary to consummate

 



\- 27 -  the Transaction; provided that in connection with obtaining the consent of
any Person or a Governmental Entity (and including in opposing any Order,
Legal Proceeding or Law, as contemplated by  _Section 2.4(c)_ and _Section
6.1(c)_ ), no Party will be required to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of, or
agree to hold separate, any business, assets or properties, (ii) terminate or
create any relationships, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangement, or (iii) effect any other restructuring of such Party or any of
its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Purchaser shall not be required to undertake any action that
would constitute a violation of the Law of any relevant jurisdiction.

(c) In the event any Legal Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or
other Person is commenced which questions the validity or legality of the
Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such Legal
Proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such Legal
Proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other
order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to
the consummation of the Transactions, in each case subject to the terms of
_Section 6.1(b)_.

6.2 _Supplement to Disclosure Schedules_. From time to time prior to
the Closing, the Seller and the Company Entities shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules hereto
solely for informational purposes and solely with respect to any matter
arising after the date hereof (each a " _Schedule_ _ _ _Supplement_ "). Any
such Schedule Supplement shall not amend or modify, in any respect, the
Disclosure Schedules for any purpose under this Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the event such event, development or occurrence which is
the subject of the Schedule Supplement, individually or taken together with
the events, developments or occurrences which are the subject of additional
Schedule Supplements, constitutes or relates to something that has had a
Material Adverse Effect and the Seller or Companies Entities notify the
Purchaser that such Schedule Supplement or Schedule Supplements constitute or
relate, individually or in the aggregate, to something that has had a
Material Adverse Effect, the Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement for failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in _Section
7.2_ , and solely in this case, where the Purchaser has the right (pursuant
to this _Section 6.2)_ to, but does not elect to terminate this Agreement
within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule Supplement, then
the Purchaser shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to the matter or matters set forth on
such Schedule Supplements under any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ _
_ _7.2_ and, further, shall have irrevocably waived its right to
indemnification under _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ with respect to such matter or
matters.

6.3  _Confidentiality_. The Purchaser acknowledges that the information
provided to it in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction is
subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement by and between Leeds
Equity Partners V, L.P. and Purchaser dated January 5, 2016 (the " _Non-
Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. In the
event that this Agreement terminates pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.4_ ,
however, the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



\- 28 - 6.4 _Publicity_. The Parties will, and will cause each of their
respective Affiliates and representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of
this Agreement and will not, and will cause each of their respective
Affiliates not to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Seller and the
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) upon the execution of this Agreement and upon the
Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser shall release a mutually agreed upon
joint (or separate) press release, and (b) any Party may, without the prior
consent of the Seller and the Purchaser, issue or cause publication of
any such press release or public announcement to the extent that such Party
reasonably determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, such
action to be required by Law or by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory
organization, in which event such Party will use its reasonable best efforts
to consult with the Seller and the Purchaser and allow reasonable time to
comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of its
issuance.

 

6.5 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, shall each pay 50% of any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of
the Transaction (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The Seller shall, at the Sellers
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to such Taxes, fees and charges and, if required by applicable Law or to
the extent reasonably requested, the Purchaser shall cooperate in the
preparation and filing, and join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

 

(b) The Seller shall have the right to elect to cause to be prepared and
filed, all income, franchise or other similar Tax Returns of the Company
Entities and/or their Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are due
after the Closing Date (all such Tax Returns, the " _Seller Prepared Returns_
"); provided that Seller provides notice to the Purchaser within 60 days
following the Closing that it elects to prepare any such Tax Return. In the
event that any such Tax Return is due in the 60-day period following the
Closing, such Tax Return shall be a Purchaser Prepared Return unless the
Seller provides written notice to the Purchaser on or before the Closing Date
indicating that Seller shall prepare and file such Tax Return. All Seller
Prepared Returns shall be prepared at the sole expense of the Seller.
Regardless of which Party prepares such Tax Returns, such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) all items
accruing on the Closing Date shall be allocated to the taxable period ending
on the Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (ii) no
election to waive a carryback of net operating losses under Section 172(b)(3)
of the Code shall be made and (iii) all Selling Expenses (regardless of when
paid), all capitalized costs that become deductible due to the repayment of
Indebtedness at the Closing or as contemplated by this Agreement, and all
payments in respect of any compensatory payments made in connection with the
Transaction (collectively, the " _Transaction Expenses_ ") shall, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law at a "more likely than not" comfort level (but
without the requirement of a formal tax opinion) as determined in good faith
by the Party preparing such Tax Return, be deducted on such Company Entitys
or one of its Subsidiaries

 



\- 29 -  income Tax Returns, as applicable, for the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date. The Seller shall provide drafts of any Seller Prepared Returns
to Purchaser, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Seller Prepared Returns, and the Purchaser shall have fifteen (15) days to
review and approve such draft Seller Prepared Returns. The Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared any (x) Tax Returns of the Company Entities
and their Subsidiaries for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date that are not Seller Prepared Returns and (y) Tax Returns of the Company
Entities and/or any of their Subsidiaries for all Straddle Periods (all
such Tax Returns, the " _Purchaser Prepared_ _Returns_ "). Within ten (10)
Business Days of Purchasers written request for reimbursement, Seller shall
reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable third party expenses incurred in
connection with preparing all income, franchise or similar Purchaser Prepared
Returns for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Such
Purchaser Prepared Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Purchaser
shall provide drafts of (i) any income Purchaser Prepared Returns to the
Seller at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Purchaser Prepared Returns and (ii) non-income Purchaser Prepared Returns as
soon as is reasonably practicable, to the Seller, and the Seller shall have
fifteen (15) days to review and approve such draft Purchaser Prepared Returns.
The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disputes over such Seller Prepared Returns or Purchaser Prepared Returns, as
applicable, for the following fifteen (15) days after receipt by the other
Party. Any disputes that cannot be resolved through negotiations between the
Purchaser and the Seller shall be taken to the Neutral Arbitrator. If a draft
Tax Return is subject to an ongoing dispute under this _Section 6.5(b)_ at the
time it is required to be filed, then such Tax Return shall be filed in a
manner as proposed by the party that prepared such Tax Return, with an amended
Tax Return reflecting the resolution by the Neutral Arbitrator to be filed
following such Neutral Arbitrators resolution of the dispute.
The determination of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be binding on the Parties.
The costs of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party, as determined by such accounting
firm. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and
expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any such
dispute shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense.

(c) The Seller shall have the right to control at its election and sole
expense, and the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in (at its own
expense), any audit, litigation or other proceeding (a " _Tax Contest_ ") for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns of the Company
Entities or any of their Subsidiaries for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party
would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or that could reduce
a Tax refund or credit to which the Seller is entitled under _Section 6.5(i)_
or any Actual Tax Savings payment under _Section 6.5(j)_ and is not reasonably
expected to impact Taxes or Tax positions in taxable periods or portions
thereof after the Closing (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Contest_ "). If the Seller
elects to control a Pre-Closing Tax Contest, (i) the Seller shall not settle,
compromise, resolve or abandon any such Pre-Closing Tax Contest without the
Purchasers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (ii) the Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser
of its intent to control such Pre-Closing Tax Contest in writing, (iii) the
Seller shall promptly take all actions reasonably necessary to allow
the Purchaser, the Company Entities, and their Subsidiaries and their counsel
to fully participate in such Pre-Closing Tax Contest, and (iv) the Seller
shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed of the 

 



\- 30 -  details and status of such matter (including providing the Purchaser with
copies of all written correspondence regarding such matter). The Purchaser
shall provide the Seller with prompt written notice of any written inquiries
by a Taxing Authority relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Contest within fifteen
(15) days of the receipt of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give notice as provided in this  _Section 6.5(c)_ shall not affect
the Purchasers right to indemnification under this Agreement so long as the
Seller was not materially prejudiced by the Purchasers failure to timely
provide such notice. If the Seller elects not to control such Pre-Closing Tax
Contest, then the Purchaser shall control such matter at the Sellers sole
cost and expense; provided, that in such case or in the case of any other Tax
Contest that relates to Taxes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (I) the Seller
shall have the right to participate in any such matter (at its own expense)
and (II) the Purchaser shall keep the Seller reasonably informed of the
details and status of such matter (including providing the Seller with copies
of all written correspondence regarding such matter). The Purchaser shall not
settle any such proceedings without the written consent of the Seller (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement or
compromise would have the effect of increasing a Tax liability for which any
Purchaser Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, or could reduce a Tax refund or credit to which the Seller is
entitled under _Section 6.5(i)_ or any Actual Tax Savings payment under
_Section 6.5(j)_.

(d) The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns for the Company Entities and/or and their
Subsidiaries, the filing and prosecution of any Tax claims, and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company Entities
or any of their Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include providing records
and information that are reasonably relevant to such matters and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide assistance in
the preparation of the Purchaser Prepared Returns and additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 

(e) Except as required by applicable Law or _Section 6.5(i)_ , without the
prior written consent of the Seller, neither the Purchaser, the Company
Entities nor any of their respective Affiliates shall, with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, make or change any Tax election, adopt or change any
accounting method, file or amend any Tax Return, surrender any right to claim
a refund of Taxes or take any other action if such election, adoption,
change, amendment, surrender or action could have the effect of increasing the
Tax liability for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement or reduce the amount of any refund or
credit or any Actual Tax Savings payment to which the Seller would otherwise
be entitled pursuant to _Section 6.5(i)_ or _Section 6.5(j)_ of this
Agreement.

 

(f) For the portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, other than
transactions expressly contemplated hereby, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company Entities and their Subsidiaries to carry on their business only in the
Ordinary Course of Business.

(g) The Purchaser, the Seller and their respective Affiliates shall cause the
Tax year of the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries to end at the end of
the day on the Closing Date for federal and applicable state, local and
foreign income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted under applicable Law. If
applicable Law does not permit the Company Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries to close its taxable year on the Closing Date or in any case in
which a 

 



\- 31 -  Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable period which includes the Closing
Date (but does not end on that day) (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the Taxes, if
any, attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that is a Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be allocated (including for purposes of _Section 6.5(i)_ ) as
follows: (i) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or
receipts, sales or use taxes, employment taxes, or withholding taxes of such
Company Entity and/or its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and, for such purpose, the taxable period of
any partnership, other pass-through entity or any "controlled foreign
corporation" within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code or a "passive
foreign investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code in
which the Company Entities or any of their Subsidiaries holds a beneficial
interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and (ii) the amount of
any other Taxes of such Company Entity and/or its Subsidiaries for a
Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period. The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, including the
Company Entities and their Subsidiaries, will file consolidated U.S. federal
income Tax Returns for all taxable periods after the Closing Date.

(h) Neither the Purchaser, the Company Entities nor any of their Affiliates
shall make an election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code (or any
comparable provision of foreign, state or local Law) in respect of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

 

(i) Except with respect to any income Tax refunds arising from the carryback
of any item of loss or deduction from a taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date (with respect to which the Purchaser shall be entitled), any
refunds for Taxes (including any interest in respect thereof) received by the
Purchaser, the Company Entities or any of their respective Affiliates, and any
amounts credited against Taxes otherwise payable to which the Purchaser, the
Company Entities or any of their respective Affiliates become entitled
(including by way of any amended Tax Return), related to, or resulting or
arising, directly from any Taxes of the Company Entities or their
Subsidiaries for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be property of the Seller. The Purchaser, the Company
Entities and their respective Affiliates shall, if the Seller so requests,
cause the Company Entities or any of their Subsidiaries, at the sole expense
of the Seller, to file for and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any
Tax refund or credit to which the Seller would be entitled under this 
_Section_ _ _ _6.5(i)_. The Purchaser shall, upon request, permit the Seller
to participate in the prosecution of any such refund or credit claim at the
expense of the Seller. All refunds paid to the Seller under this  _Section
6.5(i)_ shall be net of (i) Taxes imposed on the Purchaser, the Company
Entities or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates arising as a result of
receiving such refund, (ii) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with
obtaining such refund (including filing documents and amended Tax Returns),
and (iii) any Tax required to be withheld on such payment. Notwithstanding
_Section 4.14(b)_, if there is a subsequent reduction by the applicable
Governmental Entity (or by virtue of a change in applicable Tax Law) of any
amounts with respect to which a payment has been made to the Seller pursuant
to this _Section 6.5(i)_, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an
amount equal to such reduction plus any interest or penalties imposed by the
Governmental Entity with respect to such reduction.

 



\- 32 - (j) To the extent actually realized by the Purchaser, the Company Entities or
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the Purchaser shall pay to the
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount, in cash,
equal to the Actual Tax Savings within thirty (30) days of receiving or
realizing such amount; _provided_ ,  _however,_ that the Seller shall have no
rights to amounts hereunder five (5) years after the Closing Date. For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, Actual Tax Savings shall be deemed
realized at the time of the due date of the Tax Returns (subject to permitted
extensions) with respect to which such Actual Tax Savings relate. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Actual Tax Savings_ " shall mean the excess, if any, of
(i) the Taxes that would have been incurred by the Purchaser, the Company
Entities and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates in any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, calculated without taking
into account Transaction Expenses (and, for the avoidance of doubt, any
net operating losses attributable thereto), as compared to (ii) the actual
Taxes incurred by the Purchaser, the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries
and Affiliates in such taxable period as determined by finally filed Tax
Returns for such period (calculated by taking into account Transaction
Expenses). For each taxable period ending on or after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser will certify to the Seller, within thirty (30) days of filing a Tax
Return for such period, the amount of the Actual Tax Savings, if any. In
connection with such certification, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller
with such supporting documentation and other information with respect to the
Transaction Expenses (and any net operating losses attributable thereto) as
the Seller shall request. Any amounts paid to the Seller pursuant to this
_Section 6.5(j)_ shall be treated as additional Purchase Price for federal,
state and local Tax purposes. Notwithstanding _Section 4.14(b)_ , if there is
a subsequent reduction by the applicable Governmental Entity (or by virtue of
a change in applicable Tax Law) of any amounts with respect to which a payment
has been made to the Seller pursuant to this _Section 6.5(j)_ , then the
Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such reduction plus any
interest or penalties imposed by the Governmental Entity with respect to such
reduction.

 

(k) The Seller shall provide the Purchaser on the Closing Date with a
certificate of non-foreign status from the Seller, sworn under penalties of
perjury and duly executed in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2).

(l) All tax allocation and tax sharing agreements, arrangements, policies and
guidelines, formal or informal, express or implied, that may exist between a
Company Entity or any of their Subsidiaries, on one hand, and the Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities and their
Subsidiaries) or any third party, on the other hand, and all obligations and
rights thereunder, shall terminate as of the Closing Date, and will have no
further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year
or a past year), and the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries shall cease
to have any liability to make or rights to receive any payment thereunder for
any amounts due in respect of periods ending prior to or on or after the
Closing Date.

 

6.6 _Conduct of the Business Prior to the Closing_. Except as (i) expressly
required by the terms of this Agreement, (ii) to the extent required by
applicable Law, (iii) as set forth in _Schedule 6.6_ or (iv) as consented to
in writing by the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), during the Pre-Closing Period, each Company Entity
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (A) (i) conduct their respective
businesses in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as required by Law or as
otherwise expressly contemplated

 



\- 33 -  by this Agreement, and use reasonable best efforts to preserve substantially
intact such Company Entitys and its Subsidiaries business and all of their
material assets and properties and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
maintain in all material respects their current relations and goodwill with
vendors, customer base and other Persons having material business
relationships with such Company Entity and/or its Subsidiaries, and (B) each
Company Entity shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

(a) modify or amend any of the Governing Documents of any Company Entity or
Subsidiary of a Company Entity;

(b) issue, deliver, sell, pledge, encumber or grant (A) any shares of its
capital stock, (B) any Voting Debt or other voting securities, (C) any

rights to acquire, any such shares, Voting Debt, voting securities or
convertible or exchangeable securities, or conversion rights, preemptive
rights, rights of first refusal, redemption rights, repurchase rights, "tag
along" or "drag along" rights, commitments, agreements, Contracts,
arrangements or undertakings in respect of, security convertible into,
exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or acquire any
shares of such capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in any
Company Entity or Subsidiary of a Company Entity or (D) any "phantom" stock,
"phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units or other rights that are linked in any way to the price or value of the
Company Entity Shares, other than the Sale Bonuses;

 

(c) adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution,
merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other material
reorganization of any Company Entity or Subsidiary of a Company Entity;

consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial equity interest in or
substantial portion of the assets of, any Person, corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, association or other
business organization or division thereof or (B) any assets that are
material, individually or in the aggregate, to any Company Entity or
Subsidiary of a Company Entity, except in the case of this clause (B) for
purchases in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past practice;

(e) enter into any other Material Contract, other than in the Ordinary Course
of Business consistent with past practice, or materially amend or modify,
renew, terminate or grant any release or relinquishment of any material right

of any Benefit Plans, (A) grant or announce any equity awards or increase in
the salaries, bonuses, severance or termination pay or other compensation and

Subsidiary of a Company Entity, in each case, except in the Ordinary Course of
Business consistent with past practice or with respect to the Sales Bonus;
(B) enter into any severance or termination agreement with any director,

make any material determinations, under any Benefit Plan; (D) hire any new

 



\- 34 -  employees or terminate the employment of any employee of any Company Entity

Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the firing of any employee of any Company Entity
or Subsidiary of a Company Entity with an annual salary in excess of $200,000
shall in no instance be considered to be in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with past practice); (E) establish, adopt, enter into, amend in any

Returns), file any amended Tax Return, waive or extend the statute of

one hand, and the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a pending litigation and such information pertains to the
subject matter of such pending litigation (except as required by a valid
subpoena or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction) or constitutes
attorney-client privileged information (other than Privileged Deal

 



\- 36 -  Communications), _provided further_ , that the Purchaser shall not be
required to disclose to the Seller any information if such disclosure would
constitute a violation of applicable Law or breach of any Contract intended
to protect the confidential information of a third party to which the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company Entities and their
Subsidiaries) is a party.

 

6.9 _No Solicitation_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller and the

respective directors, officers, partners, members, managers, trustees,
employees, agents and advisors (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to,
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person other than the Purchaser with respect to, and to deal exclusively with
the Purchaser and its designated Affiliates and representatives regarding, any
and all acquisitions of, and investments in, the Company Entities and their
Subsidiaries, whether by way of merger, consolidation or other business
combination with any other Person, purchase or exchange of equity interests,
purchase of assets or otherwise (an " _Alternative Transaction_ ") and,
without the prior consent of the Purchaser, the Company Entities shall not,
and shall cause their Subsidiaries and the Representatives not to:

 

(a) solicit, initiate or otherwise engage in any negotiations, discussions or
other communications with any other Person relating to any Alternative
Transaction;

(b) provide information or documentation to any other Person with respect to

6.10 _Director and Officer Indemnification_ _and Insurance_.

(a) The Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries now
existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer,
director, or manager, as applicable, of the Company Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries, as provided in the Governing Documents of the Company Entities
or the Subsidiaries of the Company Entities, in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contract in effect on the
date hereof, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms for at least six (6)
years after the Closing Date.

 

(b) The Company Entities shall or cause one or more of their Subsidiaries, at
the Purchasers sole expense, to obtain and pay for in full as of the Closing
Date, "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policies (the " _D
andO Tail Policies_") with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing
Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors, officers and
managers of the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or
prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with

 



\- 37 -  the Transaction); _provided, however,_ that neither the Company Entities nor
their Subsidiaries shall pay or covenant to pay more than 300% of the
insurance premium of the existing directors and officers liability policies
of the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries. After the Closing, neither
Purchaser, the Company Entities nor any of their Affiliates will take any
action to negate, cancel or otherwise modify or terminate such "tail"
insurance policies.

(c) The obligations of the Purchaser under this  _Section_ _ _ _6.10_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
director, officer or manager to whom this _Section_ _ _ _6.10_ applies without
the consent of such affected director, officer or manager (it being expressly
agreed that the directors, officers and managers to whom this _Section_ _ _
_6.10_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ _ _ _6.10_
, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _6.10)_.

(d) In the event the Purchaser, the Company Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Purchaser, the Company Entities or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ _ _ _6.10_.

6.11 _Employment and Benefit Matters_. For the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date
("Benefit Period"), the Purchaser agrees to maintain, or cause to be
maintained, the compensation and benefit levels, including base salary,
annual cash incentive opportunities, retirement benefits, and health and
welfare benefits (but not including any defined benefit pension, nonqualified
deferred compensation, retiree or post-employment health or welfare benefits,
equity or equity-based compensation or benefits) for the Company Employees
during their period of employment with Purchaser or the Company Entities in
the Benefit Period, at levels which are, in the aggregate, no less favorable
than those in effect for the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Closing. The Purchaser or its subsidiaries shall treat, and cause the
applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Company Employees with
such Company Entity or any Subsidiary of such Company Entity attributable to
any period before the Closing Date as service rendered to the Purchaser or any
subsidiary of the Purchaser for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the
Purchasers or such Subsidiarys vacation program, health or welfare plan(s)
maintained by the Purchaser or such subsidiary of the Purchaser, and the
Purchasers or such subsidiarys defined contribution plans to the same extent
that such service was credited to such employee for the same purpose under
the analogous Benefit Plan, except where credit would result in duplication of
benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that any Company
Employee participates in any health or other group welfare benefit plan
of the Purchaser or a subsidiary of the Purchaser during the Benefit Period,
(a) the Purchaser or such subsidiary of the Purchaser shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility
waiting periods or required physical examinations under any health or similar
welfare plan of the Purchaser or such subsidiary of the Purchaser to be waived
with respect to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the
extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (b) use reasonable
best efforts to credit any deductibles and co-pays paid by any such Company

 



\- 38 -  Employee under any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries health plans in the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards deductibles and co-pays for
such employee under the health plans of the Purchaser or any subsidiary of
the Purchaser. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ or any other provision
of this Agreement, shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or create
any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any
Company Employee), including with respect to (x) any right to employment or
continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with
Purchaser, the Company Entities or their respective Affiliates and (y) the
ability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing Date, the Company Entities) to amend, modify, or terminate
any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any
time established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

6.12  _Affiliate Agreements_. On and as of the Closing Date, the Company
Entities and the Seller shall take all actions necessary to cause all
Contracts set forth on _Schedule 4.18_ , other than the Contracts listed on
_Schedule 6.12_ , to be terminated without any further force and effect. The
parties agree, on behalf of themselves and each of their current and future
Affiliates, that all Related Party Liabilities (other than those arising under
the Contracts listed on  _Schedule 6.12_ ) that have not been fully repaid or
discharged as of the Closing Date shall terminate and be extinguished as of
the Closing Date without the payment of any consideration or other action by
any of the Parties, their Affiliates, or any other Person and the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, take all actions
necessary or desirable to evidence such termination and extinguishment.

 

6.13 _Resignation Letters_. On and as of the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver written resignations of (a) each of the directors of each Company
Entity and each Subsidiary of a Company Entity, and (b) those officers of the
Company Entities and their respective Subsidiaries designated by the Purchaser
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

6.14 _401(k) Plan_. At least one (1) day prior to the Closing Date and subject
to the Closing, Seller shall terminate the Evanta Ventures, Inc. 401(k) Plan,
and on and as of the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver evidence of the
adoption of a resolution terminating the Evanta Ventures, Inc. 401(k) Plan and
confirming that no further contributions shall be made to such plan (other
than with respect to compensation for periods prior to Closing).

6.15 _Privacy Policy_. The Company Entities have amended the Privacy Policy
of the Company Entities, effective as of April 27, 2016, in the form set forth
in _Schedule 6.15_ hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.15_
does not require the receipt of any acknowledgment or consent of any end
users to the amendment to the Privacy Policy of the Company Entities.

6.16 _Domain Name Assignment_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
Entities will assign to Leeds Equity Advisors, Inc. or a Person designated by
Leeds Equity Advisors, Inc. the domain name LEEDSEQ.COM.

\- 42 - 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ , no Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses under
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ unless and until the aggregate
amount of all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to Two Million Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($2,750,000) (the " _Deductible Amount_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that from and after such time as the total amount of Losses
actually incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ exceeds the Deductible Amount, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only for
the amount that exceeds the Deductible Amount, and _provided, further_ , that
the Deductible Amount shall not apply to any Losses resulting from breaches
or inaccuracies of the Company Fundamental Representations or Seller
Fundamental Representations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article_
_ _ _VIII_ , no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for any individual Loss or series of related Losses under
_Section_ _8.2(a)(i)_ which do not exceed $25,000 (" _Basket Amount_ ") (which
Losses shall not count toward the Deductible Amount) unless and until such
Losses in the aggregate exceed the Deductible Amount; _provided, however_ ,
that the Basket Amount shall not apply to any Losses resulting from breaches
or inaccuracies of the Company Fundamental Representations or Seller
Fundamental Representations.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ , (i) in no

no event shall the aggregate indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ through
_Section 8.2(a)(iii))_ exceed the proceeds actually received by the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Neither a Purchaser Indemnified Party nor a Seller Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _8.2_ or _Section_
_ _ _8.3_ for any Loss to the extent the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party seeking indemnification had actual knowledge prior to
Closing of the facts, circumstances, or events that gave rise to the Loss for
which indemnification is being sought such that the applicable Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party would reasonably have been
expected to understand the potential scope and magnitude of the Loss for
which indemnification is being sought. The Party alleging that the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, seeking
indemnification should not be entitled to such indemnification because of the
prior sentence shall have the burden of proof that the Purchaser Indemnified
Party or Seller Indemnified Party seeking such indemnification had the actual
knowledge contemplated by the prior sentence. For purposes of this Section
8.4(c), (i) the actual knowledge of each of the Seller, the Purchaser, a
Subsidiary of the Purchaser, and each other Purchaser Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party that is an

 



\- 43 -  entity shall be limited to the actual knowledge prior to the Closing of the
respective directors, officers, managers and employees of the applicable
entity who were directly and materially involved in the negotiation,
evaluation or effectuation of this Agreement and the Transaction; and (ii) in
no event shall the actual knowledge of any Person who was a director, officer,
manager or employee of any Company Entity or any Subsidiary of a Company
Entity as of or prior to the Closing be imputed to the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this _Section 8.4(c)_
shall not apply to the matters described in the letters referenced on 
_Schedule 4.7(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

no Purchaser Indemnified Party may make a claim against the Indemnity Escrow
Account for any Losses other than Losses that are subject to indemnification
pursuant to  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ through _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ and (ii) the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall make any claim for Losses pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ first against the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 

(e) Any Loss for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under this  _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ shall
be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(f) For the purposes of this _Article VIII_ , the determination of (i) whether
there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation and warranty
of the Parties set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the calculation of any
Losses resulting from any such breach or inaccuracy, shall be determined
without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications
regarding materiality, the use of the word "material," "material respects,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term, qualification or limitation
based on materiality contained herein (including any reference to the
Company Entities and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole); _provided_ ,
_however_ , any reference to materiality shall be given effect for (x) the
definition of "Material Contracts" and (y) solely for purposes of clause (i)
of this Section 8.4(f), the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.4(a)_ , _Section 4.4(c)_ and _Section 4.5_.

8.5  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) In the event that indemnification may be sought under this  _Article_ _ _
_VIII_ (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") in connection with (i) any action,
suit or proceeding that may be instituted or (ii) any claim that may be
asserted, in any such case, by any Person not a party to this Agreement, the
Party seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall
promptly cause written notice of the assertion of such Indemnification Claim
to be delivered to (A) the Seller, in the case of an Indemnification Claim by
or on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or (B) the Purchaser, in the
case of an Indemnification Claim by or on behalf of the Seller Indemnified
Parties (the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth
in _Section_ _ _ _8.1_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of
the Indemnified Party in giving any such notice shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder unless (and
then solely to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to be represented by counsel of its

 



\- 44 -  choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim and, if the Indemnifying Party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim,
it shall within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature of the
Indemnification Claim so requires) (the " _Dispute Period_ ") notify the
Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party during the
Dispute Period elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the
Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such
Indemnification Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (1) so requested by the Indemnifying
Party to participate or (2) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable; _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any single Indemnification
Claim. The Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.5(a)_ to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other Party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and
such Party provide to such other Party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Partys willingness to
accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of
_Section 8.4_ , pay the amount called for by such offer, and the Indemnified
Party declines to accept such offer, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the
Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to
such Indemnification Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to
pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (x) the amount of the
settlement offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept; or (y) the
aggregate Losses of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnification
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim (and shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the
Indemnified Party in defending such Indemnification Claim) if (x) the
Indemnification Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or
relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with its
outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages
or (y) in the event the Indemnification Claim were to be unfavorably decided,
the Indemnified Party would be reasonably likely to be liable for Losses in
excess of the amounts (other than by immaterial amounts) reasonably expected
to be received from the Indemnifying Party. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Indemnification Claim can be so separated from that for
money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense
of the portion relating to money damages.

(b) In the event that an Indemnified Party has any claim against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder, but which such claim does not involve an action,
suit, proceeding

 



\- 45 -  or claim by a third party not party to this Agreement, which such
Indemnified Party determines to assert, then such Indemnified Party shall
assert such Indemnification Claim by sending written notice to the
Indemnifying Party describing in reasonable detail the nature of such claim
and the Indemnified Partys estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to
such claim.

 

(c) After any final and non-appealable decision, judgment or award shall have
been rendered by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, or a
settlement or arbitration shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to any Indemnification Claim hereunder, then
the Indemnifying Party shall pay any amount so determined to such Indemnified
Party.

(d) To the extent there is a conflict between the provisions of this _Section
8.5_ , on the one hand, and the provisions of _Section 6.5_ , on the other,
the provisions of _Section 6.5_ shall control.

 

8.6 _Calculation of Losses_.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article_ _ _ _VIII_ shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such
Losses, (ii) be net of any indemnification paid by any third party and (iii)
be reduced by any Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party to
the extent the claim for which indemnification is sought gives rise to a
deductible loss, credit or expense in the taxable period when incurred or in
the three (3) subsequent annual taxable periods, as calculated on a with
and without basis. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any
Loss and from other parties. In the event that an insurance or other recovery
is made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which
any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then such Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Seller (or one or more accounts
designated by the Seller) an amount equal to such recovery.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for consequential
damages that were not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the relevant
breach or for any special or punitive damages except in the case of a Partys
obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party for amounts actually paid to a
third party where consequential, special or punitive damages are awarded
pursuant to a third party claim (or settlement thereof) that is subject to
indemnification hereunder.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, (i)
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ to the extent that any matter, amount,
item or other fact for which they are seeking indemnification hereunder was
included as a Current Liability in determining the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Amount or is or relates to an Excluded Item, and (ii) the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ _ _
_VIII_ on account of any Losses will be reduced by the amount of any reserve
reflected on the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company Entities
and their Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 included in the Financial
Statements which were established for the general category of items or
matters similar in nature to the specific items or matters giving rise to
such Loss.

 



\- 46 - 8.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree to treat
any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ as an
adjustment to the purchase price for federal, state, local and foreign income
Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

8.8 _Exclusive Remedy; Release_. Other than with respect to claims of
intentional fraud with respect to the matters addressed by the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ hereof and any claims
seeking an injunction or specific performance with respect to a continuing
obligation of a Party (as contemplated by this Agreement), the Parties agree
that after the Closing, the exclusive remedies of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties for any Losses based upon, arising
out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this Agreement are
the indemnification obligations of the Parties set forth in this _Article_ _ _
_VIII_ and the rights, liabilities and obligations of the parties to the
Indemnity Support Agreement with respect to the subject matter thereof. To
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, and other than with respect to
intentional fraud with respect to the matters addressed by the representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ hereof, any claims seeking an injunction or
specific performance with respect to a continuing obligation of a Party (as
contemplated by this Agreement) and the rights, liabilities and obligations
of the parties to the Indemnity Support Agreement with respect to the subject
matter thereof, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser, on behalf of itself
and each Purchaser Indemnified Party, and the Seller, on behalf of itself and
the Seller Indemnified Parties, each hereby waives all other rights and
remedies either may have against the other with respect to any matter arising
out of this Agreement or the Transaction, whether under Law or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.8_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, but subject to _Section 5.7_ , the existence of
this _Article_ _ _ _VIII_ and of the restrictions set forth herein shall not
be applicable to, and shall not limit any legal remedy against any Person
with respect to, any claim of intentional fraud with respect to the matters
addressed by the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ hereof or any
claims seeking an injunction or specific performance with respect to a
continuing obligation of a Party (as contemplated by this Agreement). None of
the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to any Seller
Indemnified Parties for any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in
respect of the matters set forth in this Agreement.

9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
"Sections," or "Exhibits," such reference shall be to a section of, or an
exhibit of, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to "Schedule," such reference shall be to a section of
the Disclosure Schedules unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when
used in the plural, and vice versa, and references herein to any gender
includes each other gender. Unless expressly provided otherwise, the measure
of a period of one month or one year for purposes of this Agreement shall be
that date of the following month or year corresponding to the starting date;
provided, that, if no corresponding date exists, the measure shall be that
date of the following month or year corresponding to the next day following
the starting date. For example, one month following May 18th is June 18th,
one month following May 31st is July 1st, and one year following (or the first
anniversary of) May 18th, 2016 is May 18th, 2017. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, references to "dollars," "Dollars" and "$" will be
references to United States Dollars. The Company Entities and the Seller may,
at their option, include in the Disclosure Schedule items that are not
material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any
references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. Information disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule and the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall constitute a disclosure for all sections
of this Agreement, in each case to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such
section.

 

9.4 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, including by electronic transmission, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties. A facsimile, electronic or other reproduction of this
Agreement may be executed by one or more Parties to this Agreement, and an
executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more Parties to
this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission pursuant to which
the signature of or on behalf of such Party can be seen, and such execution
and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all
purposes. At the request of any Party to this Agreement, all Parties to this
Agreement agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any
facsimile, electronic or other reproduction of this Agreement.

 



\- 49 - 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Construction_. This Agreement (including the
definitions in Schedule I, the Disclosure Schedules, the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, the annexes and exhibits hereto and the other agreements and
instruments referred to herein), the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality
Agreement and the Indemnity Support Agreement constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The
Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

9.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, this _Section 9.6_ , _Section 9.8(b)_ , _Section 9.11(ii)_ ,
_Section 9.13_ and the last sentence of _Section 8.8_ may not be amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a manner materially adverse to
the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

 

9.7 _Waiver_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser may, with respect to the Seller
and/or the Company Entities, and the Seller may, with respect to the
Purchaser, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of its obligations
or other acts; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in its representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or
(iii) waive compliance with any of its agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an
instrument in writing and shall survive the Closing.

(b) Following the Closing, the Purchaser may, with respect to the
Seller and/or the Company Entities, and the Seller may, with respect to the
Purchaser, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of its obligations
or other acts; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in its representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or
(iii) waive compliance with any of its agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an
instrument in writing.

 

9.8 _Governing Law_ _._

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware. All legal proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court sitting in Delaware). Consistent with the
preceding sentence, the Parties hereby (a) submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware
for the purpose of any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto; (b) agree that service of process will
be validly effected by sending notice in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _9.2_ ;
and (c) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense,
or otherwise, in any such legal proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property
is 

 



\- 50 -  exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the legal proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the legal proceeding is
improper, or that this Agreement or the Transaction may not be enforced in or
by any of the above-named courts.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or the Transaction, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or, if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts of
the State of New York, the courts of the Southern District of New York
(Borough of Manhattan) (and appellate courts thereof). Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding will be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

9.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise), other than for collateral purposes, without
the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided, however_ , that
the Purchaser may, without the consent of the Seller, assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, but no
such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective, heirs, successors and permitted assigns.

9.11 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. (i) Except as otherwise specifically set
forth in _Section 6.10_ and  _Article VIII_ (including, without limitation,
_Section_ _ _ _8.3_ ) and (ii) except for the Financing Sources and their
respective successors and permitted assigns (solely with respect to their
respective rights under  _Section 9.6_ , _Section 9.8(b)_ , this _Section
9.11_ , _Section 9.13_ and the last sentence of _Section 8.8_), this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns,
and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give
any Person, other than the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder. All references herein to the enforceability of
agreements with third parties, the existence or non-existence of third party
rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third parties, or similar
matters or statements, are intended only to allocate rights and risks among
the Parties and are not intended to be admissions against interests, give
rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any Party by
any third party or give rise to any claim or benefit to any third party.

 



\- 51 - 9.12 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to (a) any other
remedy to which they are entitled hereunder, at law or in equity, prior to the
Closing Date, or (b) any other remedy to which they are entitled hereunder
after the Closing Date.

9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVERS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING THE FINANCING THEREOF.
EACH PARTY (a) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (b) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ _ _ _9.13_.

9.14 _Conflicts and Privilege_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that Goodwin Procter LLP (" _Goodwin_ ") has acted as counsel to the
Company Entities, their Subsidiaries and the Seller in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Purchaser hereby consents and agrees to, and
irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any conflict of interest arising
from or in connection with, and agrees to cause the Company Entities and
their Subsidiaries to consent and agree to and irrevocably waive and not
assert any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with, Goodwin
representing the Seller after the Closing, including with respect to disputes
in which the interests of the Seller may be directly adverse to the Purchaser
and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries).
The Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company Entities and their Subsidiaries, that all
communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among any of
Goodwin, the Seller, the Company Entities and/or any of their Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
other representatives that relate in any way to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Transaction (collectively, the " _Deal
Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained and owned by Seller, shall
be controlled by Seller, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Company Entities or any of their Subsidiaries. All Deal
Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged Deal
Communications_ ") shall remain privileged after the Closing and the
privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to Seller, shall be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to
or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Purchaser, any Company Entity or a Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and a third party other than the Seller, on the other hand, the
Purchaser, the Company Entities or the Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal
Communications to such

 



\- 52 -  third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Purchaser, the
Company Entities or any Subsidiary may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of Seller. In the event that the Purchaser, any Company
Entity or any of their Subsidiaries is legally required by Order or otherwise
to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Deal Communications, the
Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days)
notify Seller in writing (including by making specific reference to this
Section) so that Seller can seek a protective order and the Purchaser agrees
to use all commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole expense of Seller) to
assist therewith. To the extent that files or other materials maintained by
Goodwin constitute property of its clients, only Seller shall hold such
property rights and Goodwin shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such
files or other materials or any Privileged Deal Communications by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Goodwin, on the one hand, and any
Company Entity or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. The Purchaser agrees
that it will not, and that it will cause the Company Entities and their
Subsidiaries not to, (i) intentionally access or use the Privileged Deal
Communications, including by way of review of any electronic data,
communications or other information, or by seeking to have Seller waive the
attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that the
Purchaser, any Company Entity or any of the Company Entities Subsidiaries has
the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to
obtain the Privileged Deal Communications from Goodwin. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall not be in breach of this Agreement solely as a
result of inadvertent access to any Privileged Deal Communications. Seller
acknowledges and agree that, except as otherwise set forth above relating to
the Privileged Deal Communications, all other confidential and privileged
information relating to the Company Entities and its Subsidiaries belong to
the Company Entities and the Subsidiaries and, following the Closing,
Purchaser shall have full rights with respect thereto.
