Subject to the provisions of Section 5.2, Parent may conduct, at its sole cost, such title and environmental examinations or investigations, and other examinations and investigations, as it may in its sole discretion choose to conduct with respect to the Company\'s Oil and Gas Interests in order to determine whether any Title Defects or Environmental Defects (as hereinafter defined) exist. Parent may deliver to the Company in writing on or before July 6, 2001, a written notice including: (i) a specific description of each defect associated with the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company that it asserts constitutes a violation of the representations set forth in Section 3.4 (determined without considering the effect of Section 3.4(a)) or 3.15 (in either case a " _Title Defect_ ") or 3.18 (determined without considering any qualification of such representations based upon the Knowledge of the Company or whether there is a " _Material Adverse Effect_ ") (an " _Environmental Defect_ "); (ii) a description of each such Title Defect or Environmental Defect; (iii) the amount of the adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration that it asserts based on such defects; and (iv) its method of calculating such adjustment in the manner provided in subsections 5.11(c), (d) and (e).

 

On or before July 9, 2001 Company shall notify Parent whether Company agrees
with such adjustment. If Company does not agree with such adjustment, then the
parties shall enter into good faith negotiations and shall attempt to agree on
such matters.

 

If the parties cannot reach agreement concerning the amount of such
adjustment, upon either party\'s written request made by no later than July
11, 2001, the parties shall immediately submit the matter to T.S. Dudley Land
Company (in the case of a Title Defect) or to Carter-Burgess, Inc. (in the
case of an Environmental Defect) to determine the cost of curing the Title
Defect or remediating the Environmental Defect. The cost of any such
consultants shall be borne 50% by Parent and 50% by Company.

 

Each party shall present a written statement of its position on the defect in
question to the consultant by July 13, 2001. By July 18, 2001, the consultant
shall make a determination of all points of disagreement, including
consultant\'s best estimate of the cost to remediate or cure, in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination by the
consultants shall be conclusive and binding on the parties, and shall be
enforceable against any party in any court of competent jurisdiction.

  _

 2. Limits on Adjustments_. The adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 5.11 are subject to the following general limitations:

   

 1. No single Title Defect shall be taken into account as an adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration unless the value of such defect is determined to be more than $100,000 (the " _Individual Title Defect Threshold_ "); No single Environmental Defect shall be taken into account as an adjustment to Base Merger Consideration unless the cost of remediating such defect is determined to be more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) (the " _Individual Environmental Defect Threshold_ "); and

 

 2. No adjustment will be made to the Base Merger Consideration under this Section 5.11 except to the extent that the total of (x) all individual adjustments for Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold plus (y) all individual adjustments for Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Aggregate Defect Threshold_ "); by way of example, if the total of all individual adjustments for Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold equals $900,000 and the total of all adjustments for Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold is less than $100,000, then no adjustment would be made to the Base Merger Consideration; and, if the total of all individual adjustments that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold equals $1,100,000, and the total of all adjustments that exceed the Individual Environmental Defects Threshold is $500,000, then an adjustment of $1,600,000 shall be made to the Base Merger Consideration.

   _

 3. Title Defects_.

    _

 1. Adjustments_. Upon timely delivery of a notice of a Title Defect under Section 5.11(a), Parent and Company will in good faith negotiate the validity of the claim and the amount of any adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration using the following criteria:

   

 1. If the requested adjustment is based on the Company owning an NRI for a well, units rights or leasehold rights less than that shown in Schedule 1.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, and the Aggregate Defect Threshold has been met (after including the requested adjustment), then a downward adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value set forth for such well, unit rights or leasehold rights on Schedule 1.1 of the Disclosure Schedule by a fraction (1) the numerator of which is an amount equal to the NRI shown on Schedule 1.1 of the Disclosure Schedule for such well, unit rights or leasehold rights less the decimal share to which the Company would be entitled as a result of its ownership interest in such well, unit rights or leasehold rights which is unaffected by such Title Defect; and (2) the denominator of which is the NRI shown for such well, unit rights or leasehold rights on Schedule 1.1 of the Disclosure Schedule. Any downward adjustments requested by Parent may be offset by upward adjustments if it is determined that the Company\'s NRI for any other well, unit rights or leasehold rights shown on Schedule 1.1 of the Disclosure Schedule is greater than that shown on Schedule 1.1; of the Disclosure Schedule provided, however, such upward adjustments will only be made if the value of the upward adjustment from any single well, unit rights or leasehold rights exceeds $100,000. The value of an upward adjustment will be determined based on the Allocated Value for such well, unit rights or leasehold rights;

 

 2. If the requested adjustment is based on the Company owning a WI that is larger than the WI shown on Schedule 1.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, but without a proportionate increase in the Company\'s NRI and the Aggregate Defect Threshold has been met (after including the requested adjustment), then the adjustment is calculated by determining the effective NRI that results from such larger WI, determining what the NRI would be using such effective NRI and the WI shown on Schedule 1.1 of the Disclosure Schedule and then calculating the adjustment in the manner set forth in clause (A) preceding;

    

        

 1. If the requested adjustment is based on a Lien or other monetary charge upon an Oil and Gas Interest or a liability to otherwise cure a Title Defect related to an Oil and Gas Interest that the parties agree is liquidated in amount and the Aggregate Defect Threshold has been met (after including the requested adjustment), then the adjustment is the lesser of (A) the amount necessary to remove such Lien or other monetary charge from, or otherwise cure a Title Defect relating to, the affected Oil and Gas Interest; or (B) the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Interest;

 

 2. If the Title Defect potentially eliminates all or substantially all of the Company\'s title to the Oil and Gas Interest, the cost of curing or remediating will be deemed to be the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Interest;

 

 3. If the requested adjustment is based on an obligation, burden or other liability upon the affected Oil and Gas Interest not addressed by (A) through (D) above, and the parties cannot agree on the amount of such adjustment, then the adjustment, if any, shall be determined in accordance with subsection 5.11(a).

    

        _

 1. Actions to Address Title Defects_. If the Base Merger Consideration would be decreased by adjustments made pursuant to this Section 5.11(c), then, subject to the provisions of Sections 5.11(e), (f) and (g), the Company may, at its sole option and upon written notice from the Company to Parent, do any of the following or a combination thereof:

   

 1. Transfer to a third-party entity (the " _Transfer Entity_ ") any or all of the Oil and Gas Interests affected by such defects (in which case such Oil and Gas Interests shall become Excluded Assets) in which case the provisions of Section 5.11(e)(i)-(ii) shall apply except that the Base Merger Consideration shall also be reduced by any Tax payable by the Company as a result of such transfer;

 

 2. Cure some or all of the Title Defects, in which case this transaction will close as provided in this Agreement. No Base Merger Consideration adjustment will be made for the Title Defects cured prior to Closing; however, if a cure of any Title Defect cannot be completed prior to Closing, the provisions of Section 5(g) shall apply; and

 

 3. Elect not to transfer any affected Oil and Gas Interest or cure any Title Defect and reduce the Base Merger Consideration in accordance with the criteria in this Section 5.11(c), and the Company will include such adjustment in the Closing Date Merger Consideration calculation delivered pursuant to Section 5.12.

    

       _

 1. Environmental Defects_.

    _

 1. Adjustments_. Upon timely delivery of a notice of an Environmental Defect under this Section 5.11, Parent and the Company will in good faith negotiate the validity of the claim and the amount of any adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration using the following criteria:

   

 1. If the requested adjustment is based on an Environmental Defect related to an Oil and Gas Interest and the parties agree on the cost to remediate the Environmental Defect and the Aggregate Defect Threshold has been met (after including the requested adjustment), then the adjustment is the lesser of (A) the amount necessary to remediate the Environmental Defect relating to the affected Oil and Gas Interest, or (B) the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Interest;

 

 2. If the requested adjustment is based on an Environmental Defect and the parties cannot agree on the amount of such adjustment, then the adjustment, if any, shall be determined in accordance with subsection 5.11(a).

   _

 2. Actions to Address Environmental Defects_. If the Base Merger Consideration would be decreased by adjustments made pursuant to this Section 5.11(d), then, subject to the provisions of Sections 5.11(e), (f) and (g), Company may, at its sole option and upon written notice from Company to Parent, do any of the following or a combination thereof:

   

 1. Transfer to the Transfer Entity any or all of the Oil and Gas Interests affected by such defects (in which case such Oil and Gas Interests shall become Excluded Assets) in which case the provisions of Section 5(e)(i)-(ii) shall apply except that the Base Merger Consideration shall also be reduced by any Tax payable by the Company as a result of such transfer;

 

 2. Elect to cure some or all of the Environmental Defects, in which case this transaction will close as provided in this Agreement. No Base Merger Consideration adjustment will be made for Environmental Defects cured prior to Closing; however, if a cure of any Environmental Defect cannot be completed prior to Closing, the provisions of Section 5(g) shall apply; and

 

 3. Elect not to transfer any affected Oil and Gas Interest or cure any Environmental Defect and reduce the Base Merger Consideration in accordance with the criteria in this Section 5.11(d), and the Company will include such adjustment in the Closing Date Merger Consideration calculation delivered pursuant to Section 5.12.

    _

 2. Title or Environmental Defects Equal to or Exceeding Allocated Value_. Notwithstanding anything set forth to the contrary in Sections 5.11(c) or (d) hereof, if the cost to cure or remediate a Title Defect or Environmental Defect equals or exceeds the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Interest, and the Aggregate Defect Threshold has been met (after including the requested adjustment), the Parent may, at its sole option upon written notice to the Company, require the Company to transfer such affected Oil and Gas Interest (the " _Transferred Interest_ ") to the Transfer Entity in which case the following shall occur:

   

 1. The Base Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Transferred Interest; provided that if such adjustment is made with respect to a Unit or a well or Lease within a Unit, the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.11(e)(i) shall extend to all wells, Leases and Units associated with such Unit, and in such case the Base Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the amount equal to the Allocated Value of all such wells, Leases and Units;

 

 2. If the Transferred Interest was transferred on account of an Environmental Defect and Parent thereafter incurs any Damages on account thereof, Parent shall be entitled to make a claim against the Escrow Account for such Damages without regard to any limitations set forth herein.

   _

 3. Minor Title or Environmental Defects_. If the cost to cure or remediate a Title Defect or Environmental Defect equals fifty percent (50%) or less of the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Interest, Company shall not have the right to remove such Oil and Gas Interest from the Agreement as provided in Sections 5.11(c)(ii)(A) or 5.11(d)(ii)(A), and in such event Company may, at its sole option and upon written notice to Parent, take any of the other actions or any combination thereof as provided in Sections 5.11(c)(ii)(B) and (C) and 5.11(d)(ii)(B) and (C).

  _

 4. Cure of Title Defect or Environmental Defects_.

   

 1. If a Title Defect or Environmental Defect to be cured or remediated is not cured or remediated prior to the originally scheduled Closing Date, then Company may elect to either: (A) extend the Closing Date up to ninety (90) days and complete the cure or remediation; or (B) close and adjust the Base Merger Consideration by deducting the cost of the remediation or cure as determined at of the time of Closing. If the parties cannot agree on the amount of such adjustment, then the amount of the adjustment will be determined as provided in Section 5.11(a). If Company elects to extend the Closing Date, it shall give Parent written notice of its election at least three (3) days prior to the then scheduled Closing Date and provide a new date for the Closing Date.

 

 2. If the Company elects to close and deduct from the Base Merger Consideration the cost of remediation or cure as provided in subsection (i):

   

 1. if the actual cost of cure or remediation (determined in good faith) exceeds the adjustment made in respect of such Title Defect or Environmental Defect, then Parent may claim for such excess amount against the Escrow Funds, or

 

 2. if the actual cost of cure or remediation (determined in good faith) is less than the adjustment made in respect of such Title Defect or Environmental Defect, then Parent shall promptly reimburse such excess amount of the adjustment at the direction of the Shareholder Representatives.

    _

 5. Company\'s Right to Terminate_. Company may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Parent if at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing Date Parent identifies (i) Title Defects and/or Environmental Defects which, without regard to the Individual Title Defect Threshold, the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold, or the Aggregate Defect Threshold, would result in adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration in excess of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000); (ii) Environmental Defects, without regard to the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold or the Aggregate Defect Threshold, with aggregate remediation costs in excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000); or (iii) a Groundwater Violation.

  _

 6. Parent\'s Right to Terminate_. Parent may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Company if at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing Date Parent identifies (i) Title Defects and/or Environmental Defects which without regard to the Individual Title Defect Threshold, the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold, or the Aggregate Defect Threshold would result in adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration in excess of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) or (ii) Environmental Defects, without regard to the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold or the Aggregate Defect Threshold with aggregate remediation costs in excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000); or (iii) a " _Groundwater Violation_."

Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed to limit or prevent Parent or Merger Sub from making a claim against the Escrow Funds for a violation of any of the representations set forth herein, including in Section 3.4, 3,15, or 3.18; provided that if any such claim is made as a result of a Title Defect or Environmental Defect for which the Base Merger Consideration was adjusted, such claim may only be made to the extent the cost to cure or remediate such defect exceeds the adjustment.

  

     

 1. _Additional Adjustments_.

   

 1. The Base Merger Consideration will be adjusted (i) upward or downward, as applicable, by the Company\'s positive or negative Working Capital Balance as of the Effective Time; (ii) downward, by the amount by which the total principal, interest, fees and expenses outstanding on all loans outstanding under the Bank Credit Agreement as of the Effective Time exceeds zero; (iii) downward by the amount by which the total principal, interest, fees and expenses outstanding on all other Bank Debt outstanding as of the Effective Time exceeds zero; (iv) downward by the amount of all fees and expenses incurred by the Company, but not paid or recorded as a current liability prior to the Effective Time, in connection with the sale of the Company including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, investment banking and other professional fees, and title reviews, environmental surveys and similar costs; (v) downward for any costs to cure a Title or Environmental Defect incurred or paid on or after the Effective Time; (vi) upward by an amount equal to the expenditures paid or accrued by the Company from March 1, 2001 to the Effective Time in connection with the Newfield Kiev Prospect (the " _Newfield Well_ ") and the EOG Caney Creek well (the " _EOG Well_") (each as more particularly described in Schedule 3.27 of the Disclosure Schedule); and (vii) upward for the amount due pursuant to Section 5.14.

 

For purposes hereof, the " _Working Capital Balance_ " as of the Effective
Time shall be equal to the Company\'s current assets less the Company\'s
current liabilities, each as defined by GAAP consistently applied and as of
such date. For purposes of determining the current liabilities for Taxes of
the Company as of the Effective Time in calculating the Working Capital, (i)
the amount of any compensation, which may be deducted from gross income by the
Company, that is attributable to the exercise (or cancellation) or deemed
exercise of Company Stock Options upon conversion pursuant to Section 2.4(b)
at the Closing Date, shall be treated as paid to such employees prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) any Taxes payable by the Company with respect to
compensation described in subparagraph (i), including, without limitation,
FICA and Medicare Taxes, shall be treated as attributable to the period prior
to the Effective Time.

 

 2. Not later than five days before the Closing, the Company will deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") which sets forth: (i) its estimate of the Working Capital Balance as at the Effective Time as determined, pursuant to GAAP consistently applied, using good faith estimates based on the best available information at such time; (ii) its determination of the other adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration required under Sections 5.11 and 5.12(a); and (iii) the resulting adjusted Base Merger Consideration which will be due from Parent at Closing (the " _Closing Date Merger Consideration_ "). Not later than two days after receiving the Closing Date Statement, Parent will notify Company of any adjustments to the Closing Date Statement that Parent believes are appropriate. The parties will negotiate in good faith the resolution of any differences with regard to the adjustments. Company will give Parent access to all information related to the determination of the Closing Date Statement. At the Closing, the Parent shall be entitled to retain Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000) from the Closing Date Merger Consideration (the " _Working Capital Holdback_ ") to cover any potential post-closing downward adjustment resulting from actual Working Capital Balance being less than the estimated Working Capital Balance.

 

 3. If information becomes available during the 120-day period following the Closing that causes either Parent or the Shareholders\' Representatives to determine that the actual Working Capital Balance according to GAAP consistently applied varied from the estimated Working Capital Balance set forth in the Closing Date Statement, the Parties shall in good faith work together to reconcile any discrepancy in the actual adjustments and the estimated adjustments. If the Parties have not agreed within 150 days following the Closing Date, the final Working Capital Balance will be determined by Ernst and Young L.L.P. The Parties agree that Ernst and Young\'s final Working Capital Balance shall be conclusive, and Ernst and Young\'s fees associated with the determination of such final Working Capital Balance shall be paid by Parent out of the Working Capital Holdback. 

 

No later than 15 days after the Parties agree on, or Ernest and Young\'s
determines, the actual Working Capital Balance:

   

 1. if it is determined that the actual Working Capital Balance at the Effective Time was less than the estimated Working Capital Balance set forth in the Closing Date Statement (the amount thereof being referred to as the " _Working Capital Deficiency_ "), then Parent shall retain for its own account such part of the Working Capital Holdback as is equal to the Working Capital Deficiency (or all of the Working Capital Holdback if the Working Capital Deficiency exceeds the Working Capital Holdback) and, if the Working Capital Deficiency is less than the Working Capital Holdback, pay the balance of the Working Capital Holdback to the Shareholders\' Representatives for distribution to the former holders of the Company Certificates, Company Stock Options and Company Convertible Debentures in accordance with Sections 2.5(a), 2.4(b)(iii) and 2.4(b)(iv); if the Working Capital Deficiency exceeds the Working Capital Holdback, Parent shall be paid an amount equal to such excess from the Escrow Fund; and

 

 2. if it is determined that the actual Working Capital Balance at the Effective Time was greater than the estimated Working Capital Balance set forth in the Closing Date Statement (the amount thereof being referred to as the " _Working Capital Surplus_ ") Parent shall pay to the Shareholders\' Representatives for distribution to former holders of Company Certificates, Company Stock Options and the Company Convertible Debentures in accordance with Sections 2.5(a), 2.4(b)(iii) and 2.4(b)(iv) an amount equal to the sum of the Working Capital Holdback and the Working Capital Surplus.

   

 2. _Company Employees_.
