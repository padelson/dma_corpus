W I T N E S S E T H : 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company, and the Company desires to be acquired by Parent; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") as soon as practicable after the date hereof upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, each person listed on Exhibit A-1 hereto is entering into a voting agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter contained and intending to be bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

   

 Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI hereof. Following the Merger the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. 

  

 Section 1.02 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall be consummated, as and when provided in Section 1.11 hereof, by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger in such form as is required by, and executed in 

   ##### 

  

 

accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing
being the "Effective Time"). 

   

 Section 1.03 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub. As of the Effective Time, the Company shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 Section 1.04 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. Subject to Section 5.06(a), the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of Merger Sub shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by law. 

  

 Section 1.05 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall constitute the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

  

 Section 1.06 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

  

 Section 1.07 _Conversion of Securities._  

  

 At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof: 

   

 (a) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.02) or owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 

  

 (b) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and 

  

 (c) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.01)) shall, except as provided in Section 1.07(a), be converted into the right to receive $12.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), and all such shares shall no longer 

   ##### 

  

 

be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 Section 1.08 _Employee Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each holder of then outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted by the Company (whether or not then presently exercisable) (the "Options") will be entitled to receive, and shall receive, in settlement of each Option where the amount set forth in clause (i) below is positive, a cash payment from the Company in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration minus the exercise price per share of the Option and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Option, and each holder of Options that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth above, if any. The Company agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, it will take all actions necessary to provide that all Options outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and will timely deliver to the holders of Options any notices or other communications required to be provided by the terms of the applicable Option plan. 

  

 Section 1.09 _Warrants_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each holder of then outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted by the Company (whether or not then presently exercisable) (the "Warrants") will be entitled to receive, and shall receive, in settlement of each Warrant where the amount set forth in clause (i) below is positive, a cash payment from the Company in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration minus the exercise price per share of the Warrant and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Warrant, and each holder of Warrants that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth above. 

  

 Section 1.10 _Stockholders  Meeting_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, in order to consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors (the "Board"), shall: 

  

 (a) take all action under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), DGCL, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting (the "Special Meeting") of its stockholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 3.07) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or its representatives on the one hand and the SEC or its staff on the other hand with respect to the Proxy Statement; after consultation with Parent, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect thereto; and have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement and other proxy materials to be mailed to its stockholders, subject in each case to a reasonable opportunity for Parent to review and comment on any document to be filed with or furnished or provided to the SEC; and 

  

 (c) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the necessary approval of this Agreement by its stockholders. Parent agrees that, at the Special Meeting, it shall cause all of the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.11 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, as soon as practicable after the vote of the stockholders of the Company in favor of the approval of this Agreement has been obtained, the Company shall execute in the manner required by the DGCL and deliver to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a duly executed and verified certificate of merger as required by the DGCL and the parties shall take such other and further actions as may be required by law to make the Merger effective. Prior to the filings referred to in this Section 1.11, a closing (the "Closing") will be held at the offices of Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, 1650 Arch Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (or such other place as the parties may agree) for the purpose of confirming all of the foregoing. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

DISSENTING SHARES; EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

   

 Section 2.01 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who object to the Merger and comply with all of the relevant provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the consideration provided in Section 1.07(c) of this Agreement but shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the relevant provisions of such Section 262, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders 

   ##### 

  

 

shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,
the right to receive the consideration provided in Section 1.07(c),
without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

   

 Section 2.02 _Exchange of Shares._  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company or similar entity reasonably acceptable to the Company that is authorized to exercise corporate trust or stock powers to act as Exchange Agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). At the Effective Time, Parent will provide the Exchange Agent the funds necessary to make the cash payments contemplated by Section 1.07. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, one or more forms of a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate or payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to promptly so pay, cash in an amount equal to the number of (i) shares represented by such Certificate, _multiplied_ by (ii) the amount of the Merger Consideration with respect to such shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Any funds remaining with the Exchange Agent one year following the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent after which time former stockholders of the Company, subject to applicable law, shall look only to Parent for payment of amounts due hereunder, without interest thereon. 

  

 (c) All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all 

   ##### 

  

 

rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate. On the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation or the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer or any other reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II. 

   

 (d) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.08)), any Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (f) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Options, Warrants or shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, in respect of such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.02 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand; _provided, however,_ that if the holder of any such shares shall have effectively withdrawn or lost 

    ##### 

 

    

such right to appraisal, Parent shall immediately thereafter provide the
Exchange Agent with the funds necessary to make the cash payments
contemplated by Section 1.07(c) in respect of such shares. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule (the "Disclosure Schedule") delivered to Parent by the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 Section 3.01 _Organization_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and each such corporation has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority to own, operate and lease its respective properties and to carry on its businesses as they are being conducted on the date of this Agreement. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it requires such qualification except for such failures to be so qualified or in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.11(b)). The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company and the governing documents of each of its Material Subsidiaries (as defined in Regulations S-X) as currently in effect. 

  

 Section 3.02 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_. 

  

 (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 10,000 shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, 10 shares are designated as Series B Preferred Stock and 588,229 shares are designated as Series C Preferred stock. As of August 2, 2006, 5,500,206 shares of Company Common Stock, no shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock and no shares of Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding and 48,822 shares of Company Common Stock were held in the Companys treasury. Except for the obligation of the Company to issue (i) 979,678 shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Options currently outstanding (including the currently non-exercisable portions thereof), (ii) 437,029 shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Warrants currently outstanding, (iii) shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and shares of Company Common Stock under certain circumstances upon exercise of the rights ("Rights") issued pursuant to that certain 

   ##### 

  

 

Rights Agreement, dated September 13, 1996, between the Company
and StockTrans, Inc., as amended (the "Rights Agreement") and (iv) rights
pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan, non-tax qualified stock
purchase plan and United Kingdom employee stock ownership plan of the Company
(each a "Stock Purchase Plan," and collectively, the "Stock Purchase Plans"),
there are no outstanding options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other
rights or other agreements or commitments obligating the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in paragraph (d) below).

The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal controls.

Oversight Board, or (iii) investigations by the audit committee of the Board
regarding any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or

practices or maintains improper or inadequate internal accounting controls.
The Company will promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub information as to
any such matters that arise after the date hereof.

   #####

 Section 8.11 _Certain Definitions._  

  

 (a) "subsidiary" shall mean, when used with reference to an entity, any corporation or other entity, a majority of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned directly or indirectly by such entity. 

  

 (b) "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any adverse change in the financial condition, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries which is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or which will have a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or prohibit the Company from consummating the Merger, excluding any changes relating to (i) public or industry knowledge relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, actions or inactions of employees, customers or vendors) or (ii) changes in general economic or regulatory conditions affecting at any time the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or economic conditions in the industry or industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, which changes do not affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, disproportionately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at its option, include in the Disclosure Schedule items that would not have a Material Adverse Effect within the meaning of the previous sentence, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment by the Company that such items would have a Material Adverse Effect or further define the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) "person" shall include individuals, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, other entities and groups. 

  

 (d) "knowledge of the Company" shall be deemed to include only the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of the directors and those executive officers of the Company listed on  _Exhibit B_.

Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably designate, appoint and empower Parents counsel and the Company hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, in each case as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact in its name, place and stead to receive and accept on its behalf service of process in any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters as to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.13 _Construction; Interpretation._  

   

 (a) The parties hereby agree that any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the party that drafted it has no application and is expressly waived. 

  

 (b) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, Subsection, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section or Subsection of, or a Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The phrase "the date hereof" means the date of this Agreement. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement or instrument defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Words used in the singular form in this Agreement shall be deemed to import the plural, and _vice versa_ , as the sense may require and words importing one gender shall include the other two. 

  

 Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
