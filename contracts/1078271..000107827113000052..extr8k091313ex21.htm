Net Accounts, Estimated Inventory, the Estimated Indebtedness and the
Estimated Cash, and calculating the Closing Consideration.

Section 2.07 Post Closing Adjustment.

(a) Promptly, but in any event within sixty (60) calendar days after the
Closing Date, Buyer and its auditors shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement, duly certified by Buyer as accurately setting forth Buyer's good
faith determination in accordance with the Accounting Principles of (i) the
Indebtedness of the Company, (ii) the cash of the Company and (iii) the
Accounts Payable, (iv) the Accounts Receivable, (v) the Net Accounts and (vi)
the Inventory of the Company (in each case as of the close of business) on the
Closing Date and determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and the Company Accounts Schedule), together with (x)
the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated trial balance of the
Company from which such determinations were derived, and (y) such other
relevant information on which the calculations reflected thereon are based, in
such detail as shall be reasonably acceptable to Seller (such statement,
together with such accompanying balance sheet and other information, the
"Closing Statement"). The Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the
Closing Statement and determining Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts, Inventory, cash and Indebtedness is to measure changes in the
components taken into consideration in determining the Closing Consideration.
Such process is not intended to permit the introduction of different
components, judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
preparing the Closing Statement or determining the cash, Indebtedness,
Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Net Accounts and Inventory from the
Accounting Principles and the Company Accounts Schedule, as applicable.

(b) If Seller disagrees with Buyer's determination of the Indebtedness, cash
Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Net Accounts and/or Inventory, in each
case as reflected on the Closing Statement, Seller may, within sixty (60)
calendar days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a signed written
notice (the "Dispute Notice") to Buyer setting forth Seller's objection(s) to
the Closing Statement (each an "Item of Dispute"). Buyer will cooperate with
Seller to provide it with such other information used in preparing or related
to the Closing Statement reasonably requested by Seller including, upon
reasonable advance notice, access during normal business hours to relevant
records of Buyer. If Buyer does not receive a Dispute Notice within sixty (60)
calendar days after delivery by Buyer of the Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties. If Buyer
receives a Dispute Notice from Seller within sixty (60) calendar days after
delivery by Buyer of the Closing Statement, Buyer and Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to resolve each Item of Dispute, and, if any Item of
Dispute is so resolved, the Closing Statement shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect
such resolution. If any Item of Dispute remains unresolved as of the 20th
calendar day after delivery by Seller of the Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller
shall jointly retain the New York, New York office of Grant Thornton LLP to
resolve such remaining disagreement; provided that, if the New York, New York
office of Grant Thornton LLP is then unavailable for such purposes, Buyer and
Seller shall jointly retain an independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing, excluding for such purpose each Big Four Accounting Firm,
to resolve such remaining disagreement; provided, further, that in such case,
if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the choice of such firm, then such
firm will be a nationally recognized independent accounting firm (other than a
Big Four Accounting Firm) selected by lot, after excluding one firm designated
by Buyer and one firm designated by Seller (the firm actually retained
pursuant to this sentence, the "Accounting Firm"). Buyer and Seller shall
request that the Accounting Firm render a determination as to each unresolved
Item of Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days after its retention, and
Buyer and Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company and each of their
respective agents and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the
Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such determination as quickly and
accurately as reasonably practicable, including the provision by Buyer and the
Company of all books and records and work papers (including those of their
accountants and auditors) relating to the Closing Statement and all other
items reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm (in each case in such a
manner so as not to waive or eliminate any privilege applicable to any such
information). The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts
that were set forth on the Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice and that
remain unresolved and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value
claimed by Buyer or Seller for such item or smaller than the smallest value
claimed by Buyer or Seller for such item in the Written reports submitted to
the Accounting Firm. Buyer and Seller agree that any market or business
developments after the Closing shall not be taken into consideration and that
the status of the Target Companies' affairs and market circumstances at the
time of the Closing shall prevail. The Accounting Firm's determinations shall
be based upon the definitions of Indebtedness Accounts Payable, Accounts
Receivable, Net Accounts and Inventory included herein. The Accounting Firm's
determination of each Item of Dispute submitted to it shall be in Writing,
shall conform with this Section 2.07, and shall be conclusive and binding upon
each of the Parties, and the Closing Statement shall be modified to the extent
necessary to reflect such determination(s) and the Accounting Firm's final
determinations of such matters shall be non-appealable and incontestable by
the Parties and each of their respective Affiliates and successors and assigns
and not subject to collateral attack for any reason other than manifest error
or fraud. The Accounting Firm shall allocate its fees, costs and expenses
between Buyer on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand, in proportion to
the difference between the Accounting Firm's determination of the Items of
Dispute and the value of the adjustment to the Closing Consideration claimed
by each of Buyer and Seller. For example, if it is Buyer's position that the
adjustment owed is $300, Seller's position that the adjustment owed is $100
and the Independent Accounting Firm's finding that the adjustment owed is
$250, then Buyer shall pay 25% (300-250 / 300-100) of the Accounting Firm's
fees and expenses and Seller shall pay 75% (250-100 / 300-100) of the
Accounting Firm's fees and expenses. The Indebtedness, cash, Accounts Payable,
Accounts Receivable and Inventory, in each case as finally agreed upon or
determined pursuant to this Section 2.07, are referred to herein as the
"Actual Indebtedness the "Actual Cash," the "Actual Accounts Payable," the
"Actual Accounts Receivable" and the "Actual Inventory" respectively. (c) Payments to Buyer. If (i) the Actual Indebtedness is greater than the
Estimated Indebtedness, (ii) the Estimated Cash is greater than the Actual
Cash, (iii) the sum of Actual Net Accounts Receivable plus the Actual Accounts
Payable (where the Actual Accounts Payable is treated as a negative number)
(the "Actual Net Accounts") is (A) less than the Estimated Net Accounts and
(B) less than the Minimum Net Accounts, or (iv) the Actual Inventory is less
than (A) the Estimated Inventory and (B) less than the Minimum Inventory,
Seller shall, within ten (10) Business Days after determination of the Actual
Indebtedness, Actual Cash, Actual Accounts Payable, Actual Accounts
Receivable, Actual Net Accounts and Actual Inventory, pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in
Writing by Buyer, an amount (the "Closing Deficiency") equal to (w) the excess
of the Actual Indebtedness over the Estimated Indebtedness, (x) the excess of
the Estimated Cash over the Actual Cash, (y) (i) if the Estimated Net Accounts
were less than the Minimum Net Accounts, then the excess of Estimated Net
Accounts over the Actual Net Accounts or (ii) if the Estimated Net Accounts
were greater than or equal to the Minimum Net Accounts, then the excess of
Minimum Net Accounts over the Actual Net Accounts, (z) (i) if the Estimated
Inventory was less than the Minimum Inventory, then the excess of Estimated
Inventory over the Actual Inventory or (ii) if Estimated Inventory was greater
than the Minimum Inventory, then the excess of Minimum Inventory over the
Actual Inventory, as applicable. If Seller fails to timely make such payment
that is finally determined to be owed to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.07,
then (i) Buyer may, at its sole election, direct the Escrow Agent in signed
writing (with a copy of such direction delivered concurrently to Seller) to
promptly disburse an amount equal to the Closing Deficiency to Buyer and (ii)
Seller shall promptly (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days) pay to
the Escrow Agent, for the benefit of the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the
Closing Deficiency.

(d) Payments by Buyer. If (i) the Estimated Indebtedness is greater than the
Actual Indebtedness, (ii) the Actual Cash is greater than the Estimated Cash,
(iii) the Actual Net Accounts is greater than the Estimated Net Accounts or
(iv) the Actual Inventory is greater than the Estimated Inventory, Buyer shall
pay to Seller, within ten (10) Business Days after determination of the Actual
Indebtedness, Actual Cash, Actual Accounts Payable, Actual Accounts
Receivable, Actual Net Accounts and Actual Inventory, an amount (the "Upward
Adjustment Amount") equal to (w) the excess, if any, of the Estimated
Indebtedness over the Actual Indebtedness, (x) the excess, if any, of Actual
Cash over Estimated Cash, as applicable, (y) the excess of the Actual Net
Accounts over the Estimated Net Accounts, such amount not to exceed the excess
of the Minimum Net Accounts over the Estimated Net Accounts (for the avoidance
of doubt, if the Minimum Net Accounts does not exceed the Estimated Net
Accounts, then no amounts shall be payable by Buyer pursuant to this clause
(y)) and (z) the excess, if any, of the Actual Inventory over the Estimated
Inventory, such amount not to exceed the excess of the Minimum Inventory over
the Estimated Inventory (for the avoidance of doubt, if the Minimum Inventory
does not exceed the Estimated Inventory, then no amounts shall be payable by

(ii) any opposition or cancellation proceedings or actions before any court or

equivalent authority anywhere in the world) to which any Target Company is a
party and in which claims are raised relating to the validity, enforceability,
scope, or ownership of any of the Registered Intellectual Property, but not
including proceedings or actions issued in the ordinary course of prosecution
of any applications or maintenance of any Registered Intellectual Property;
and (iii) each material unregistered trademark owned by any Target Company.
The Target Companies own the Company Owned Intellectual Property, free and
clear of any Liens, except Permitted Liens. No Registered Intellectual
Property is jointly owned by any Target Company and any Person not
constituting a Target Company, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no
Registered Intellectual Property has a defect or irregularity in title that
would reasonably be expected to materially impair the value of or continued
use of such Registered Intellectual Property. No Target Company has
transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to,
any material Company Owned Intellectual Property. (b) The Target Companies have taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain
and protect all of the Company Owned Intellectual Property material to the
conduct of the Target Companies' respective businesses. With respect to each
item of material Registered Intellectual Property: (A) all necessary
registration, maintenance and renewal fees have been paid, and all necessary
documents and certificates have been filed with the relevant patent,
copyright, trademark or other authorities in the United States or foreign
jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of protecting and/or
maintaining such Intellectual Property Rights; (B) each such item is currently
in compliance with formal legal requirements (including payment of filing,
examination and maintenance fees and proofs of use); (C) each such item is
sustaining, and except with respect to applications, to the Knowledge of the
Company, valid and enforceable; and (D) each such item is not subject to any
late unpaid maintenance fees or Taxes. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
Person has Threatened, in the two (2) year period prior to the Closing Date,
that any of the Registered Intellectual Property is invalid or unenforceable.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no Target Company has misrepresented, or
failed to disclose, any facts or circumstances in any application for any
Registered Intellectual Property that would constitute fraud or a
misrepresentation with respect to such application or that would otherwise
affect the enforceability of any Registered Intellectual Property, in either
case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially impair the
value of or continued use of such Registered Intellectual Property or
application, as applicable.

(c) Schedule 3.12(c) identifies each signed written (i) license, agreement or
other permission pursuant to which any Target Company licenses or otherwise
obtains permission to use Intellectual Property or Technology from a third
party, in each case that is material to the Company (and other than licenses
for unmodified commercially available, "off the shelf software" with a
replacement cost and/or annual license fee of less than $50,000 and licenses
for Open Source Software listed in Schedule 3.12(j)) ("Company Licensed
Intellectual Property") and (ii) license, agreement or other permission which
any Target Company has granted to any third party with respect to any material
Intellectual Property Rights or material Technology (other than end user
agreements entered into in the Ordinary Course in the form of the end user
agreement Made Available to Buyer without any material modifications). Except
for the Open Source Software listed in Schedule 3.12(j), no third party that
has licensed or provided Intellectual Property Rights or any Technology to any
Target Company has retained ownership of or license rights under any
Intellectual Property Rights in any material improvements or derivative works
made solely or jointly by any Target Company under such license.

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, and assuming, solely for the purposes of
this Section 3.12(d), that the Company did not, does not and will not have the
benefit of any rights granted to it under that certain agreement set forth on
Schedule 3.12(d), the operation of the businesses of the Target Companies as
conducted on or prior to the Closing Date does not infringe, violate,
misappropriate or otherwise conflict with any Intellectual Property Rights of
any Person.

(e) Within the past twelve (12) months, no Target Company has received any
bona fide Written notice (including any formal Written offers to take a
license), alleging that any Target Company has infringed, misappropriated,
violated, or otherwise conflicted with any of the Intellectual Property Rights
owned by any Person or that any Company Owned Intellectual Property is invalid or unenforceable (but not including proceedings or actions issued
in the ordinary course of prosecution of any applications or maintenance of
any Registered Intellectual Property). No Company Owned Intellectual Property,
Company Product or Company Planned Product or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Company Licensed Intellectual Property, is subject to any pending
proceeding, outstanding judgment, order, or stipulation that restricts in any
manner the use, provision, transfer, assignment or licensing thereof by any
Target Company or may affect the validity, use or enforceability thereof.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no third party is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any Company Owned Intellectual
Property in a material manner.

(g) Each current and former employee, independent contractor and consultant of
any Target Company involved in the creation of any material Company Owned
Intellectual Property (a "Contributor") has executed and delivered to the
applicable Target Company a signed written agreement sufficient to ensure that
the Target Companies are the sole owner or assignee of any Intellectual
Property Rights such Person creates within the scope of such Person's
employment or in the case of a non-employee, from the services such Person
performs for the Target Companies, unless or except to the extent that the
Target Companies are entitled to become or elect to become the owner or
assignee of such Intellectual Property Rights by operation of Law, and that
provides for the confidentiality of any trade secrets or other confidential
information learned by such Person in the scope of such Person's employment or
services. Without limiting the foregoing, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
Contributor has Threatened any Target Company with respect to any alleged
ownership or rights of Contributor. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of
the Target Companies' employees' and consultants' work for the Target Company
has been in any way done in breach of such employees' or consultants'
obligations to any third parties, including any confidentiality or
Intellectual Property Rights and Technology transfer obligations.

(h) With respect to Software owned by any Target Company: (a) to the Knowledge
of the Company, such Software has not been disclosed, including for purposes
of escrow, to any third party except in binary code format; (b) the Target
Companies have used commercially reasonable efforts to protect the
confidentiality of the Software; and (c) to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a requirement that any
such Software be released, disclosed or delivered to any Person by any Target
Company, any escrow agent, or any Person acting on their behalf and to the
Knowledge of the Target Company, no third party would be likely to prevail in
asserting any rights to Company Intellectually Property as work for hire or
otherwise in connection with any work done by an employee or consultant of the
Target Company for such third party at any time.

(i) No Target Company has experienced within the past twelve (12) months any

SVB has agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, to lend
the amount set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing").

(b) Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Debt Financing that are payable on or prior to the date
hereof, and as of the date hereof the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of
Buyer, and, to the knowledge of Buyer, SVB, the Debt Commitment Letter has not
been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement and no such
amendment or modification is contemplated. No commitment contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and the Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect. There are no side letters,
agreements, contracts or other arrangements related to the Debt Financing that
could increase the conditionality or reduce the amount of the Debt Financing.
The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of SVB thereunder to make the full amount of the Debt Financing
available to Buyer on the terms in the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
obligations of SVB to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the performance of Seller under
this Agreement and subject to the accuracy of Seller's representations and warranties contained herein, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer (or to Buyer's Knowledge,
any other party thereto) under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the
Debt Commitment Letter or would otherwise be reasonably likely to result in
any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable.
Assuming the performance of Seller under this Agreement and subject to the
accuracy of Seller's representations and warranties contained herein, as of
the date of this Agreement, Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Debt
Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it.

(d) The Debt Financing, together with Buyer's unrestricted cash on hand and
other current available credit facilities, are sufficient to enable Buyer to
consummate on a timely basis the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including to pay the Closing Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02 and all
other amounts payable by Buyer hereunder (and under the Debt Commitment Letter
and any fee arrangements related thereto), in each case in accordance with the
terms hereof. In no event shall the receipt by, or the availability of any
funds or financing to, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any other financing
be a condition to Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder.

Section 4.06 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no outstanding
material injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling against Buyer, which
could adversely affect Buyer's performance under this Agreement, the other
agreements contemplated hereby or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Buyer is not a party to any material Action,
nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer, is any material Action Threatened, before any
court or judicial or administrative agency of any Governmental Authority which
could adversely affect Buyer's performance under this Agreement, the other
agreements contemplated hereby or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 4.07 Solvency. As of the Closing, and immediately after giving effect
to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and assuming that
the representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this Agreement
are true and correct in all material respects (and, solely for purposes of
this Section 4.07, without giving effect to any limitation or qualification as
to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or other terms of similar import or
effect) and the Target Companies are Solvent immediately prior to the Closing,
then each of Buyer and the Target Companies, on a consolidated basis, will be
Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.07, "Solvent" means that, with respect
to any Person and as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
"present fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person, will, as of such
date, exceed the amount of all "liabilities of such Person, contingent or
otherwise," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in
accordance with applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct its business, and
(c) such Person will be able to pay its indebtedness as it matures.

Section 4.08 Investment Intent; Restricted Securities. Buyer is purchasing the
Stock solely for its own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a
view to, or any present intention of, reselling or otherwise distributing the
Stock or dividing its participation herein with others. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act. Buyer
acknowledges that it is informed as to the risks of the transactions
contemplated hereby and of ownership of the Stock. Buyer understands and
acknowledges that (i) none of the Stock has been registered under the
Securities Act or any state or foreign securities Laws, in reliance upon
specific exemptions thereunder for transactions not involving any public
offering, (ii) none of the Stock is traded or tradable on any securities
exchange or over-the-counter, and (iii) the Stock may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer,
sale or other disposition is pursuant to the terms of an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act and are registered under any
applicable state or foreign securities Laws or pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state or foreign
securities Laws. Buyer will not transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the
Stock acquired hereunder or any interest therein in any manner that may cause
Buyer to be in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities Laws.

Section 4.09 Arrangements with Management. Except for any agreements,
documents or other instruments contemplated to be entered into pursuant to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement with, or agreed to enter
into, or caused any of its Affiliates to enter into, any agreement or
understanding with, or otherwise provided remuneration, fees or other economic
benefits to, any current director, officer, manager of any of the Target
Companies.

hereby, without the consent of the other Party, provided however, that Buyer
shall file this Agreement as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose this transaction

contractual or fiduciary obligation. If Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives are compelled to disclose any such information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller will promptly
notify Buyer in Writing and will disclose only that portion of such
information that Seller is advised by its counsel in good faith is legally
required to be disclosed; provided, however, that Seller will, with reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses to be borne by Buyer, exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information. During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause its

not to: (a) initiate, solicit or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries
or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer (including any
proposal or offer to its stockholders or any of them) with respect to a
merger, acquisition, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, equity investment or similar transaction involving, or any
purchase of all or any substantial portion of the assets or any equity
securities of, any Target Company (any such proposal or offer being
hereinafter referred to as a "Proposal"); (b) engage in any negotiations

confidential information or data is requested from, or any negotiations or

with, Seller, any Target Company or any of their respective directors,

(a) Buyer agrees to, or cause the Target Companies to, provide to employees of

upon any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement; (ii) is intended to confer upon any employee of any Target
Company any right to continued employment for any period or continued receipt

any time after the Closing and for any reason, including without cause.

following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland and
Ellis LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to Seller or any director,
officer, employee, Affiliate or direct or indirect member, partner or
stockholder of Seller in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation of any Target Company,
and each of the Parties hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom, and each of such Parties shall cause any Affiliate
thereof to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation;

respects to all applicable professional ethical obligations.

Section 6.08 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Target Companies) not to, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify the indemnification provisions of any Target
Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar governing
documents as in effect at the Closing in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at the Closing were directors,
officers, managers, employees or holders of equity interests of such Target
Company (to the extent such person is entitled to receive indemnification from
a Target Company, an "Indemnified Person"). From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall assume, be liable for and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and
shall cause the Target Companies to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 6.08, without limit as
to time. Buyer shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by an Indemnified Person in enforcing
the covenants set forth in this Section 6.08. In the event Buyer, any Target
Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, Buyer shall make proper provision so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or the applicable Target Company, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.08. The provisions of this Section 6.08 shall survive the consummation of
the Closing. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary
(including, without limitation, the provisions of Article IX), any liability
to The Gores Group, LLC, Siemens AG of their affiliated direct or indirect
shareholders of the Guarantor to be incurred by Buyer or any Target Company
for any Indemnified Person for acts, omissions or failures to act as of or
prior to Closing with respect to fiduciary duties relating to the
authorization and performance of Seller under this Agreement, shall be the
sole and exclusive liability of Seller and any liability of Seller under this
sentence shall be uncapped, without limitation, and subject to the applicable
statute of limitations.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller will obtain, or will cause the Company to
obtain, and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies to satisfy any liability
for the indemnification referred to in Section 6.08(a) hereof with a claims
period of at least six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Target Companies' current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
with coverage amounts terms and conditions not less favorable than those
policies currently in place for Buyer, including a coverage amount of not less
than $15,000,000 (with no denigration of Side B or Side C coverage). Such tail
policies will be endorsed to name Buyer as an insured entity with unrestricted
access to make claims under Side B and C coverage (but will not in any way
make Buyer an insured for purposes of any insurer vs insured or entity vs
insured exclusion). Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts so that
such policies do not exclude coverage for actions brought by one insured
against another insured or insureds.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.08 shall survive the consummation of the
Closing.

Section 6.09 Post-Closing Record Retention and Access. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller and its authorized representatives with
reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal
business hours and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of the Target Companies, to any books and records
and other materials in the possession of the Target Companies relating to
periods prior to the Closing Date reasonably requested for the preparation of
Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns or claims for refund relating to Pre-Closing
Periods (and any materials necessary for the preparation of any of the
foregoing), the preparation of financial statements including for periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and the management and handling of any
Action, whether or not such Action is a matter with respect to which
indemnification may be sought hereunder), compliance with the rules and
regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange
Commission or any other Governmental Authority; provided that such access
shall not obligate the Target Companies to take any action that would
unreasonably disrupt the normal course of their businesses or violate any
applicable Law. Buyer's obligations with respect to such books and records
shall include maintaining, for at least the retention period specified in this
Section 6.09, computer systems permitting access to any such books and records
which are stored in electronic form in a fashion which is not less efficient
than current access methods. Unless otherwise consented to in Writing by
Seller, Buyer shall not and shall cause each of the Target Companies not to,
for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any books and records and other materials of the Target
Companies, or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering to surrender to Seller such books and
records and materials or such portions thereof.

Section 6.10 Other Tax Provisions.

(a) Tax Indemnity. Seller shall be liable for, shall pay (or cause to be paid)
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all Indemnified Taxes; provided that, Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify Buyer with respect to Indemnified Taxes described in
clause (ii) of the definition thereof to the extent Seller was not accorded
the right to control any applicable Tax Proceeding relating to such
Indemnified Taxes in accordance with Section 6.10(f)(iii). The Seller's
obligations to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Section
6.10(a) shall survive until thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations relating to liability for any such
Taxes, and notwithstanding, any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shall not be subject to the limitations of Section 9.04(a).

(b) Tax Refunds.

(i) Entitlement. Without duplication of items actually taken into account to
reduce any Damages under Section 9.04(e), Tax Refunds shall be for the account
of Seller, and, if applicable, the Target Companies or Buyer shall pay over to
Seller any Tax Refund, within five (5) Business Days after receipt thereof;
provided, however, that Buyer may offset any Tax Refund against the amount of
any Tax indemnification obligation due and payable by Seller under Section
6.10(a) which has not been timely paid.

(ii) Covenant to Pursue. After the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to continue to work in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to diligently prosecute any Tax Refund claims.

(iii) Application of Foreign Income Tax Benefit Items.

(1) Pre-Closing Period Application Priority. In connection with any Tax
Proceeding related to Foreign Income Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period, the
preparation and filing of any Target Company Sale Period Tax Returns, any
amendment of Income Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods and any applicable Tax
Refund claim, Foreign Income Tax Benefit Items shall, to the maximum extent
allowed by Law, be applied first (whether as a deduction, carryover or
carryback) to a Pre-Closing Period prior to being applied to any Post-Closing
Period (and prior to any carryback, if any, of net operating losses, capital
losses, other excess of deductions and losses over taxable income and gains,
Tax overpayment, and any other Tax credits or other Tax assets arising in a
Post-Closing Period).

(2) Covenant to Pursue. To the extent a Tax Refund claim arises after Closing
that is attributable to Foreign Income Tax Benefit Items, Buyer shall prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any forms required by Law
(including, but not limited to, amended Income Tax Returns) to claim such Tax
Refund to the fullest extent permitted by Law. (c) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar
agreements between Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than any Target
Company), on the one hand, and any Target Company, on the other hand, shall be
terminated and all payables and receivables arising thereunder shall be
settled, distributed or eliminated in a manner determined by Seller, in each
case prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, none of the Target
Companies shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder or under any
payables or receivables arising thereunder.

(d) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return and any Tax Proceeding, to the extent
that Seller may have any liability hereunder with respect to such Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding or any tax planning and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder or
otherwise provide services to Buyer, Seller or any of their affiliates
relating to the preparation of any Tax Returns. Each of Buyer and Seller
further agrees upon request of the other to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including any Transfer Taxes). Seller
agrees (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Target Companies in Seller's possession, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority
having or purporting to have jurisdiction with respect to any Tax and (ii) to
give Buyer reasonable Written notice prior to destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, Seller shall allow
Buyer to take possession of such books and records.

(e) Preparation of Tax Returns. In the event of any dispute between Buyer and
Seller relating to the preparation of any Tax Return pursuant to this Section
6.10(e), the dispute shall be settled by the Accounting Firm (or such other
Person reasonably acceptable to each Party) pursuant to procedures similar to
those described in Section 2.07(b).

(i) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Target Company Sale Period Tax Returns. At least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date (taking into account any extensions) for any Target Company Sale
Period Tax Return that is an Income Tax Return or a material Non-Income Tax
Return, Buyer shall provide to Seller drafts of such Target Company Sale
Period Tax Return and shall, prior to filing thereof, make any changes
requested by Seller. In the event of any dispute regarding any such requested
changes, the dispute shall be settled by the Accounting Firm (or such other
Person reasonably acceptable to each Party) pursuant to procedures similar to
those described in Section 2.07(b). Without the prior Written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, Buyer will not (A) file or amend, or permit any Target Company to
file or amend, any Tax Return of any Target Company relating to any Pre-
Closing Period, unless such amendment is required by applicable Law, as agreed
by Seller in Writing or determined by the Accounting Firm (or other applicable
Person) in resolution of a dispute under this Section 6.10(e), or such
amendment reasonably could not increase Indemnified Company Taxes or (B) make
any Tax election having retroactive effect, unless such election is required by applicable Law, as agreed by Seller in Writing or
determined by the Accounting Firm (or other applicable Person) in resolution
of a dispute under this Section 6.10(e), or such election reasonably could not
increase Indemnified Company Taxes. If Buyer does not seek the Seller's
Written consent under this Section 6.10(e)(i) to file or amend a Tax Return or
make an election having retroactive effect, then the Seller shall not be
liable for and Buyer shall hold the Sellers harmless from any Damages
resulting therefrom or any Damages with respect to such Tax Return that was
restated, amended or modified.

(ii) The Foreign Income Tax Benefit Items shall be reported on applicable
Income Tax Returns solely as income Tax deductions of the applicable Target
Companies for a Pre-Closing Period and shall not be treated or reported as
income Tax deductions for any Post-Closing Period unless (A) otherwise
required by applicable Law or (B) otherwise available as a carryover to a
Post-Closing Period after first being applied (whether as a deduction,
carryover or carryback) to the Pre-Closing Period.

(f) Tax Proceedings. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the
contrary, Section 9.07 and Section 9.08 shall not apply to Tax matters, which
shall be governed exclusively by this Section 6.10.

(i) Target Company Tax Returns. Buyer will have the right to control, at
Buyer's expense, any Tax Proceedings relating to any Tax Return or Taxes of
the Target Companies with respect to a Straddle Period (excluding Seller
Affiliated Group Tax Returns), including any disposition of such Tax
Proceeding; provided, however, that Seller will have the right, directly or
through its designated representatives, to review in advance and comment upon
all submissions made in the course of Tax Proceedings relating to a Straddle
Period and to participate in all meetings or other communications relating to
such Tax Proceedings, and Seller's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) shall be required for any settlement, concession or
other material action with respect to such Tax Proceeding by Buyer that could
require any indemnification payment by Seller pursuant to this Agreement,
reduce any amount payable to Seller pursuant to Section 6.10(b) or otherwise
adversely affect Seller or its affiliates.

(ii) Audits of Seller Affiliated Group Tax Returns. Seller will have the right
to control, at the Seller's expense, any Tax Proceedings relating to any
Seller Affiliated Group Tax Return and any other Tax Proceeding of or relating
to the Target Companies relating solely to a Pre-Closing Period.

(iii) Tax Proceedings relating to Certain Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding
any provision of this agreement to the contrary, Seller shall have the
exclusive right to control any Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes described in
clause (ii) of the definition of Indemnified Taxes, and, to the extent any
such Taxes are asserted or imposed but Seller was not accorded the right to
control, Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer, any Target
Company or any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such Taxes.

(g) Allocation of Tax Liability for Straddle Periods. To the extent permitted
by Law, the Tax year of each Target Company shall close on the Closing Date.
For all purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are payable for a taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
related to the Pre-Closing Period shall:

(i) in the case of ad valorem, property or similar Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire taxable period, and

(ii) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on and included the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity, or any non-U.S. entity, in which the Company directly or
indirectly holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time); provided, however, that any Tax attributable to any action taken by
Buyer, or at Buyer's direction, outside of the Ordinary Course on the Closing
Date after the Closing and not contemplated by the terms of this Agreement,
shall be treated as a Tax related to the Post-Closing Period beginning on the
day after the Closing Date.

(h) Tax Shelter. Buyer shall not take any action after the Closing that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be part of an
intermediary transaction tax shelter as described in IRS Notices 2001-16 and
2008-111.

(i) Section 338(h)(10) Election. Each of Buyer and Seller agree to file (or
cause to be filed) joint elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any similar or related provision of state, local or non-U.S. law) to treat the
purchase and sale of the Target Companies as a purchase and sale of assets for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and, to the greatest extent permitted by Law,
for state, local and non-U.S. income tax purposes. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with respect to any such elections and any Tax forms or Tax Returns
required to be filed in connection therewith (including any amendments or
revisions of any such Tax forms or Tax Returns). The Parties agree that the
Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement) and the liabilities of
the Target Companies treated as assumed for Tax purposes (plus other relevant
items, including Transaction Expenses) shall be allocated among the assets of
the Company for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting)
determined as follows:

(i) Proposed Tax Allocation. Seller shall prepare a proposed allocation (the
"Proposed Tax Allocation") and shall deliver the Proposed Allocation to Buyer
within thirty (30) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing
Consideration.

(ii) Final Tax Allocation. Buyer shall have the right to review and raise any
objections in Writing to the Proposed Tax Allocation within fifteen (15)
Business Days after Buyer's receipt thereof. If Buyer does not timely raise
any objections, the Initial Allocation shall become the "Final Tax
Allocation." If Buyer disagrees with respect to any item in the Proposed Tax
Allocation, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
dispute. If Buyer and Seller are unable, within fifteen (15) Business Days
after receipt by the Seller of such notice of objections, to resolve the
disputed items, such disputed items will be referred to the Accounting Firm
and, except as set forth specifically in this Section 6.10, the procedures set
forth in Section 2.07 shall be followed and apply with respect to such
dispute. The Accounting Firm shall, within thirty (30) Business Days, deliver to Buyer and Seller a Written report
setting forth its determination as to such disputed items (and only such
disputed items), and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon
the parties thereto for purposes of the Final Tax Allocation. The Accounting
Firm's fees, costs and expenses shall be borne equally by each of Buyer and
Seller.

(iii) Consistent Reporting. Buyer and Seller agree for all Tax reporting
purposes to report the transactions contemplated herein in accordance with the
Final Tax Allocation and to not take any position during the course of any
audit or other proceeding inconsistent with the Final Tax Allocation unless
required by a determination of the applicable Governmental Authority. Buyer
and Seller shall each provide to the other for review a copy of its IRS Form
8883 at least ten (10) Business Days prior to its submission to the Internal
Revenue Service.

(j) Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes, together with any interest, penalties
or additions to such Transfer Taxes, shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-
half by Seller. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the
provisions of all applicable Laws in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Taxes, and shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest
extent possible under such Laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable
in connection therewith. Each Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other Party from and against any Transfer Taxes for which it is responsible
pursuant to this Section 6.10(j).

Section 6.11 Additional Agreements of Buyer. Buyer agrees and acknowledges
that, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller and
its Affiliates and representatives do not make any representation or warranty,
express or implied, at law or in equity, in respect of any of the assets,
liabilities, operations, cash flows or future financial condition of any
Target Company or in respect of the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Target Companies furnished or made available to
Buyer and its representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer makes no
waiver of any claim or right with respect to fraud. In connection with Buyer's
investigation of the Target Companies, Buyer has received certain projections,
including projected statements of operating revenues and income from
operations of the Target Companies and certain business plan information.
Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is
familiar with such uncertainties. Accordingly, Buyer hereby acknowledges that
no Target Company or Seller is making any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
including, without limitation, the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts.

Section 6.12 Restrictive Covenant Agreements.

(a) From the Closing until the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the
Closing Date or such earlier date that Seller is directly or indirectly
acquired by an unaffiliated third party, neither the Seller, nor any of its
Subsidiaries will (a) manufacture enterprise network products or components,
including modular or fixed switches or routers or wireless access points,
other than products or components manufactured by Seller or its subsidiaries
as of the date hereof (other than the Target Companies) (the "Restricted
Business") for sale or distribution to any geographical area in which the
Target Companies or Buyer engage in the Restricted Business, or have
definitive plans to engage in the Restricted Business, in each case as of the Closing Date, or
(b) acquire, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in any Person that is
primarily engaged in the Restricted Business in any geographical area in which
the Target Companies or Buyer engage in the Restricted Business, or have
definitive plans to engage in such Restricted Business, in each case as of the
Closing Date. Nothing herein shall prohibit any Person from (i) being a
passive owner of not more than two percent (2%) of any class of stock of a
corporation, which class of stock is publicly traded, so long as such Person
has no active participation in the business of such corporation or (ii) the
acquisition of any Person engaged in the Restricted Business so long as the
portion of the revenues of such Person primarily related to the Restricted
Business does not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total revenues of such
Person during the preceding twelve (12) months.

(b) From the Closing until the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the
Closing Date, neither Seller, Guarantor nor any of their respective Controlled
Affiliates (the "Seller Restricted Parties"), shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit, induce or hire, or attempt to solicit, hire or induce any employee of
the Target Companies to terminate his or her employment, or solicit, induce or
hire or attempt to solicit, induce or hire any consultant or independent
contractor of the Target Companies to discontinue work with the Target
Companies, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any Target
Company and any employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Target
Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations on solicitation set
forth herein shall not prohibit the use of any general solicitations not
specifically directed at the employees, consultants or independent contractors
of Buyer or the Target Companies, or the hiring of any Person that (i) was
terminated by the Buyer or Target Company, as applicable, other than as a
result of circumstances intended to circumvent the restrictions of this
Section 6.12(b) or (ii) has not been employed by Buyer or any Target Company
for a period of at least twelve (12) months.

(c) The Parties agree that the foregoing covenants impose reasonable
restraints on Seller and its Controlled Affiliates in light of the activities
and business of Buyer on the date of the execution of this Agreement and the
current plans of Buyer for the Target Companies from and after the Closing.
Additionally, because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to Buyer
as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenants, and because of the
immediate and irreparable damage that could be caused to Buyer for which it
would have no other adequate remedy, Seller agrees that the foregoing
covenants may be enforced by Buyer by injunctions, restraining orders, and
other equitable actions.

Section 6.13 Debt. At any time prior to or at Closing, Seller may, (a) elect
to settle, cancel or repay, or cause the Target Companies, to settle, cancel
or repay, any Intercompany Accounts or indebtedness of any Target Company for
borrowed money by any Target Company, trade payables owing to any Target
Company and/or accrued expenses owed by any Target Company arising in the
Ordinary Course or (b) if agreed to by Buyer in writing to have any of the
foregoing obligations remain in place following the Closing. Immediately
following the Closing there will be no further Intercompany Accounts other
than trade payables owing to any Target Company and/or accrued expenses owed
by any Target Company arising in the Ordinary Course.

Section 6.14 Notification of Certain Matters. Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, will, upon obtaining Knowledge (or in the case of
Buyer, actual knowledge), give prompt notice to the other party of the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non- occurrence of which is likely to cause the condition set forth in Section
7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as applicable, to not be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.14 will
not (i) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party
receiving such notice or (ii) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a
breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by Seller pursuant to this Section
6.14 will be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent
or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

Section 6.15 Employees.

(a) Offers. The Company and the other Target Companies will cooperate and work
with Buyer to help Buyer identify, and give Buyer access to, employees of the
Target Companies to whom Buyer may elect to offer continued "at-will"
employment (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) following the Closing
with the Company, Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries. With respect to any
employee of the Target Companies who receives an offer of continued employment
from the Target Companies, Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries, the Target
Companies will assist Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries with their efforts to
enter into offer letters with such employee as soon as practicable after the
date hereof, which offer letters will become effective upon the Closing.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will be
construed to create a right in any employee of the Target Companies to
employment with Buyer, any Target Company, or any other Subsidiary of Buyer
and, subject to any agreement between a Continuing Employee and Buyer, an
Target Company or any other Subsidiary of Buyer, the employment of each
Continuing Employee will be "at will" employment.

Section 6.16 280G Approval. Seller as the sole stockholder of the Company will
request applicable employees to waive their payments and/or benefits, in each
case, in a manner and form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, in accordance
with the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, and to hold a shareholder
vote in accordance with such terms, so as to render (if such vote approves the
payments and/or benefits) the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of
the Code inapplicable to any and all payments and/or benefits provided
pursuant to contracts or arrangements with employees that have agreed to waive
their payments and/or benefits that would otherwise result, separately or in
the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the provision of any
benefit that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code,
with such approval (if the vote approves the payments and/or benefits) to
satisfy all applicable requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of
such Treasury Regulations. Buyer shall provide any information reasonably
requested by Seller with respect to agreements entered into by Buyer in order
to permit Seller to obtain appropriate waivers and to make any disclosures
required pursuant to Section 280G(b)(5)(B).

Section 6.17 Releases. Prior to or concurrent with execution of this
Agreement, each of the Persons set forth in Schedule 6.17 will have executed
and delivered to Buyer a Release of Claims in the form attached hereto as
EXHIBIT D.

Section 6.18 Adoption of 2013 Equity Incentive Plan; Company Retention Grants.
Seller will cause the Company to take all necessary action to (a) adopt the
2013 Equity Incentive Plan, including, without limitation, approving the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan as the
sole stockholder of the Company and (b) grant to each individual designated by
Buyer an award of that number of stock options or restricted stock units under
the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan covering shares of Company common stock as may
be directed by Buyer (the "Company Retention Grants"), to be evidenced by
stock option or restricted stock unit agreements in forms prescribed by Buyer
and to be subject to such other terms ascribed to such individual as directed
by Buyer, in each case of clause (a) and clause (b), not later than
immediately prior to the Closing. Upon the Closing, the 2013 Equity Incentive
Plan and the Company Retention Grants shall be formally assumed by Buyer using
an exchange ratio based upon the fair market value of Seller' and Buyer's
common stock.

Section 6.19 Financing; Cooperation.

(a) Buyer shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to consummate and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants
applicable to Buyer in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate and enter
into all definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) satisfy all
conditions to such definitive agreements that are applicable to Buyer and
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its
(or causing its Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts to cause SVB to
fund the Debt Financing, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter in the event of a material breach thereof by the debt financing
provider(s) thereunder (provided that Buyer shall not be required to commence
any Action against such debt financing provider) and (vi) comply with its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter.

(b) Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide
to Seller copies of all executed definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give
Seller prompt (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days) Written notice:
(i) of any default or breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or
breach) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive document
related to the Debt Financing of which Buyer or its Affiliates becomes aware,
(ii) of the receipt of any Written notice or other communication from any
Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential default, breach,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing or (B) dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing, and (iii) if for any reason Buyer has determined in good faith that
it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event, within three (3)
days following delivery by Seller to Buyer of Written request therefor, Buyer
shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence. (c) Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
consent to any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment
Letter, if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter to an
aggregate amount less than $30,000,000, (ii) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner adverse to Buyer or the Target
Companies, (iii) amends or modifies any other term of the Financing Letters in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or
(iv) adversely impacts the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter. Any reference in this Agreement
to (x) "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Financing Letters as amended or modified in compliance with this Section
6.19(c), and (y) "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such document as
amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.19(c).

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its
reasonable efforts to arrange promptly to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources such that Buyer can fulfill its obligations hereunder
without breaching Section 4.05 as if such representation was made as of the
Closing Date (the "Alternate Debt Financing"), and to obtain a new financing
commitment letter with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (together with
any related fee letter, the "New Debt Commitment Letter") which shall replace
the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a true, complete and correct copy of
which shall be provided by Buyer to Seller promptly and in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is
obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall
mean, with respect to the Debt Financing, the debt financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be
deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by
the New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and the New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein are not
conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the Debt Financing, the
availability of any Alternative Debt Financing or receipt of the proceeds
therefrom.

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause each of the Target Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the officers, directors, employees,

required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any liability or
obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing and (C)
neither Seller nor any of the Target Companies shall be required to issue any

breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) there has been a
material breach or failure to perform on the part of the other Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 7.02, or Section 7.03, as applicable, to not be satisfied at the
Closing and which breach or failure, if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured within fifteen (15) calendar days following receipt by the other

(it being understood and hereby agreed that neither Party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) if such breach or failure is cured
within such fifteen (15) calendar day period; provided, however, that no cure
period will be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured);
provided that the failure by Buyer to deliver the Closing Consideration as and
when required hereunder shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless
otherwise agreed to in Writing by Seller;

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if a court of competent jurisdiction or
Governmental Authority shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree

restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transaction contemplated

pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) shall have complied with its obligations
under Section 6.05 by using its commercially reasonable efforts to have any
such order, decree ruling or other action vacated or lifted) or (ii) there
will be any Law enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the
Closing by any Governmental Authority that would make consummation of the
Closing illegal;

(d) by Buyer, by giving Written notice of such termination to Seller, if any
statute, rule, regulation or order is enacted applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby by any Governmental Authority, which requires any action that, pursuant to Section
6.05(c) cannot be undertaken without Buyer's Written consent; or

(e) by either Seller or Buyer if the transactions contemplated hereby have not
been consummated prior to the date that is 180 days following the date hereof,
or, in the event that a Governmental Authority has (i) issued a request or
notified the Parties that it intends to issue a request for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or (ii) instituted
or Threatened to institute any suit or action challenging the validity or
legality of, or seeking to restrain the consummation of the transactions

Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this

(Confidentiality), Article X (Miscellaneous) hereof and this Section 8.02,

breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement; provided further that any
party seeking relief will not be entitled to such relief if it is in breach of

terminate the Agreement under Section 8.01.

ARTICLE IX 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.01 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements.

(a) All of the representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in
this Agreement, any Related Agreement, or in any certificate or other
instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement and all covenants and
agreements of Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement that are to be
performed in their entirety prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing
until, and shall terminate on, the date that is fifteen (15) months after the
Closing Date (the expiration of such period, the "Survival Date"); provided,
however, that the representation and warranties of Seller contained in (i)
Section 3.01(a) (Organization of the Target Companies), Section 3.02
(Authorization of Transaction; Binding Effect) and Section 3.04
(Capitalization; Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations") shall survive the Closing until, and shall terminate on the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the "Fundamental Rep
Survival Date") and (ii) Section 3.11 (Tax Matters) and Section 3.17 (Employee
Benefits) will survive the Closing until, and shall terminate on, the date that is thirty (30) calendar days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the "Extended Rep
Survival Date").

(b) All covenants and agreements of Seller and Buyer contained in this
Agreement that are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing Date
shall survive in accordance with their respective terms and unless an earlier
date is specified herein, shall terminate on the date the is the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that all covenants and agreements
contained in Sections 6.09 and 6.10 shall terminate on the date that is the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date.

(c) The representations and warranties, covenants and obligations of Seller,
and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties,
will not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any information
furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of the
Indemnified Parties or any of their Affiliates. Such representations and
warranties, covenants and obligations will not be affected or deemed waived by
reason of the fact that the Indemnified Parties knew or should have known that
any representation or warranty might be inaccurate or that the Indemnifying
Party failed to comply with any agreement or covenant. Any investigation by
such party will be for its own protection only and will not affect or impair
any right or remedy hereunder.

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that if any Target Company suffers,
incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damage as a result of or in
connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of any Target
Company as an Indemnified Party) Buyer will also be deemed, by virtue of its
ownership of the stock of the Target Companies, to have incurred such Damage
as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach.

Section 9.02 Special Definitions. Any Person providing indemnification
pursuant to the provisions of this Article IX is hereinafter referred to as an
"Indemnifying Party" and any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IX is hereinafter referred to as an "Indemnified
Party."

Section 9.03 Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article IX, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and Buyer's
Affiliates, officers, directors and Representatives (the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties") against and in respect of any and all claims, costs, losses, damages
(including lost profits), liabilities, deficiencies, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses,
including attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses and including any such
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or
settling any of the foregoing, and diminution in value, excluding in each case
any such damages measured by multiple of earnings or profits ("Damages") to
the extent resulting or incurred from (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty of Seller or any other Person contained in this
Agreement, the Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instruments
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any failure by Seller or any other
Person to perform or comply with any covenant applicable to any of them
contained in this Agreement, the Related Agreements or in any certificate or
other instruments delivered or to be delivered to Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the amount of any Closing Deficiency, if any, (iv) any Transaction Expenses or
Indebtedness of Seller or the Target Companies as of the Closing that are not
paid at or prior to the Closing or included in the final determination of any
Closing Deficiency, or (v) any Fraud as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. Seller will not have any right of contribution, indemnification
or advancement of expenses from the Target Companies or Buyer with respect to
any Damage claimed by an Indemnified Party.

Section 9.04 Limitations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

(a) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person pursuant to, and
shall not have any liability under, this Agreement until the aggregate amount
of all Damages for which Seller would be liable under this Agreement exceeds
on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,200,000 (the "Deductible");
provided that, once such Damages exceed the Deductible, Seller shall become
liable for only the Damages that exceed the Deductible. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer will be entitled to recover for, and the Deductible will not
apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to
Damages resulting from: (i) any breach of a representation or warranty
contained in the Fundamental Representations, (ii) any Closing Deficiency not
paid to Buyer or offset in accordance with Sections 2.07(c) or (e), as
applicable and (iii) fraud (Losses in clauses (i) through and including (iii),
collectively, "Exempted Losses").

(b) Except for Exempted Losses and Damages resulting from any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty contained in the Tax
Representations ("Tax Losses"), the amount of Damages that may be recovered by
Buyer pursuant to Section 9.03 will not exceed an amount equal to the Escrow
Fund. For the sake of clarity, (i) the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and
exclusive recourse for all Damages for breaches of representations and
warranties that are not Exempted Losses, Tax Losses or breaches or
inaccuracies of a representation or warranty contained in the Employee
Benefits Representations (the "Employee Benefits Losses"), and (ii) Employee
Benefits Losses, while limited to Damages recoverable under Section 9.03, and
to an amount in the aggregate, together with all other Damages recoverable
under Section 9.03, equal to the Escrow Fund, may be recovered from an
Indemnifying Party following the distribution of the Escrow Fund for claims
submitted prior to the Extended Rep Survival Date and finally determined to be
owed to a Buyer Indemnified pursuant to this Article IX. Except with respect
to Damages from fraud, the aggregate amount of Damages that may be recovered
by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.03 will not exceed the Final Closing
Consideration.

(c) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer to the extent that (i)
provision or reserve in respect of the matters giving rise to such Damage has
been made in the Current Balance Sheet, or (ii) the matter giving rise to such
indemnification claim was taken into account in connection with, or disputed
and resolved in connection with, the determination of the final Closing
Statement pursuant to Section 2.07.

(d) Any claim for Damages made by the Buyer prior to the date that is twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been withdrawn
unless a formal Action has been commenced within twelve (12) months of the
notification of Seller of such Damages pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. (e) For purposes of determining Seller's liability under this Article IX for
any Damages or under Section 6.10(a) for any Indemnified Taxes, appropriate
reductions or offsets shall be made to reflect (i) any net Tax benefits
actually realized by any Indemnified Party in connection with the accrual,
incurrence, or payment of such Damages or Indemnified Taxes, (ii) the recovery
pursuant to any insurance policy received by any Indemnified Party in respect
of such Damages. For purposes of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to have realized a net Tax benefit to the extent that the amount of
Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party, Buyer, the Target Companies or any of
their Affiliates, as would be shown on the applicable Person's Tax Return for
the year in which the Damages or Indemnified Taxes are incurred or
indemnification payment is made, or any year to which a deduction or loss
attributable to such Loss or payment is carried back, is reduced below the
amount of Taxes that the Indemnified Person would have been required to pay
but for the deduction attributable to the indemnifiable Damages or Indemnified
Taxes or payment (taking into account any increase in net Taxes as a result of
the Indemnified Party's receipt or accrual of such indemnity payment or
indemnification, contribution or similar payment from a third party). For the
avoidance of doubt, a mere increase in Tax attributes shall not be deemed to
result in a net Tax benefit for purposes of this Section 9.04(e). If the
amount of any net Tax benefit determined pursuant to this Section 9.04(e) is
subsequently increased or decreased as a result of a final "determination"
under Section 1313 of the Code (or similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), then the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the
case may be, shall pay to the other an amount such that the aggregate amount
paid to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.04 equals the amount that
would have been paid to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.04 had the
result of the final "determination" been taken into account in the initial
calculation of the amount of the net Tax benefit.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Seller's liability
under Section 6.10(a) or this Article IX, to the extent such liability relates
to any Tax matters (the "Seller Tax Indemnity") shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of net Tax benefit with respect to any Foreign Income Tax
Benefit Items that Buyer, the Target Companies or any of their Affiliates
realizes in any Post-Closing Period ending on or before the seventh taxable
year of the Target Companies ending after the taxable year including the
Closing Date with respect to any Foreign Income Tax Benefit Items. The amount
of such reduction applicable to any indemnity payment under this Agreement
shall be the aggregate amount of all such Tax benefits realized (as determined
in the manner described in Section 9.04(e)) in Post-Closing Periods ending on
or prior to the taxable year in which such payment is made, less any such
amounts previously applied against Seller's indemnity obligation under this
Section 9.04(f). If the aggregate amount of Tax benefits with respect to any
Foreign Income Tax Benefit Items realized by Buyer, the Target Companies or
any of their Affiliates in Post-Closing Periods determined as of the end of
the seventh taxable year of the Target Companies ending after the taxable year
including the Closing Date exceeds the amount of such Tax benefits previously
applied to reduce Seller's indemnification liability hereunder, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall pay to Seller an amount of cash equal to the lesser of (i)
the amount of such excess and (ii) the aggregate amount of Seller Tax
Indemnity payments made by Seller that were not reduced under this Section
9.04(f).

(g) Except for Exempted Losses, Tax Losses and, following the distribution of
the Escrow Fund until the Extended Rep Survival Date, Employee Benefits
Losses, claims under Section 9.03 will be satisfied solely from the Escrow Fund and recourse
against the Escrow Fund will provide the sole and exclusive remedy following
the Closing (it being understood that nothing in this Article IX or elsewhere
in this Agreement will affect the Parties' rights to specific performance or
other equitable remedies with respect to the covenants referred to in this
Agreement or to be performed after the Closing). Claims by an Indemnified
Party for Exempted Losses or Tax Losses, will be satisfied: (i) first, from
the Escrow Fund, but only after (A) satisfying all other pending claims not
related to Exempted Losses or Tax Losses, and (B) making appropriate reserve
as provided herein for any unresolved pending claims not related to Exempted
Losses or Tax Losses, and (ii) second, if the Escrow Fund is insufficient
after such satisfaction or reserve, the amount of such deficiency, (A) in the
case of fraud, directly from Seller without limit, (B) in the case of Exempted
Losses or Tax Losses, directly from Seller until an amount equal to the Final
Closing Consideration has been recovered by Buyer pursuant to such claim and
all other claims made by any Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be
required to indemnify any Person (i) with respect to any inaccuracy in any
representation, directly or indirectly, by implication or otherwise, relating
to the amount or sufficiency of any net operating losses, Tax basis or any
other Tax attribute, except, to the extent not compensable under Section
6.10(a), to the extent relating solely to an increase in Taxes actually
payable with respect to a Pre-Closing Period and (ii) for any Taxes for any
taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date (calculated
in accordance with Section 6.10(h).

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and subject to the
provisions of Section 9.04(f) (treating the Specific Indemnity Losses as a
Seller Tax Indemnity thereunder), Seller shall indemnify Buyer for all Damages
to the extent resulting from or incurred in connection with the matters set
forth on Schedule 9.04(i) (the "Specific Indemnity Losses"). Such Specific
Indemnity Losses shall not be subject to any limitations set forth in this
Section 9.04 (other than the limitations set forth in Section 9.04(f)),
including, without limitation, the Deductible or the Escrow Amount. Claims by
a Buyer Indemnified Party for Specific Indemnity Losses will be satisfied
directly from Seller, payable in cash or by wire of immediately available
funds.

Section 9.05 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
each of Seller and Seller's Affiliates, officers, directors and
representatives (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against any Damages to the
extent resulting from (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or the breach
of any warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or in any certificate required
to be delivered pursuant hereto, (ii) the breach by Buyer of any covenant or
agreement to be performed by it hereunder and (iii) in respect of any Taxes,
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses or other Damages incurred by any
Seller Indemnified Party in connection with adoption of the 2013 Equity
Incentive Plan and/or any Company Retention Grants.

Section 9.06 Exclusive Remedy. Except as provided in Section 10.02, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that, except with respect to fraud, its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby (including any
relating to environmental, health or safety matters, including any relating to
Hazardous Materials or arising under Environmental Laws) shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX, Section 6.08 or
Section 6.10, as applicable. In furtherance of the foregoing, but without limiting the rights of
indemnification expressly provided for under this Article IX or Section 6.10,
except with respect to fraud, each Indemnified Party hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
except as provided in Section 10.02, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (including any right, whether arising at Law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or
remedy, including the remedy of rescission and remedies that may arise under
common law) it may have against any Indemnifying Party whether arising under
or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign Law (including any relating
to environmental matters, including any arising under Environmental
Requirements) or otherwise.

Section 9.07 Procedures for Third Party Claims.

(a) To be entitled under this Agreement to indemnification in respect of a
claim or demand by another Person (a "Third Party Claim"), an Indemnified
Party must deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after determining in
good faith that it has a bona fide claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX, notice of such Third Party Claim (a "Claim Notice"), specifying,
to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, a non-binding estimate of
the amount of such claim, the nature and basis of such claim and the material
facts and circumstances known by the Indemnified Party relating thereto,
including copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. No delay
or failure in providing such Claim Notice prior to the Survival Date,
Fundamental Rep Survival Date or the Extended Rep Survival Date, as
applicable, will affect an Indemnified Party's rights hereunder, unless the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual prejudice caused by such delay or
failure, and then only to the extent thereof. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed on a current basis as to any
changes or developments with respect to the foregoing, including providing
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) from time to time
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) Subject to the further provisions of this Section 9.07, the Indemnifying
Party will have thirty (30) calendar days (or less if the nature of the Third
Party Claim requires) from the date on which the Indemnifying Party received
the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any
litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice (reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) and at its sole cost and expense (a
"Third Party Defense"). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the Third Party
Defense in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party will
be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is
within the scope of its indemnity obligation hereunder and will hold the
Indemnified Party harmless from and against the full amount of any Losses
resulting therefrom (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement).
Any Indemnified Party will have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such Third Party Defense and to participate therein, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel will not be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party unless
(A) the Indemnifying Party will have failed, within the time after having been
notified by the Indemnified Party of the existence of the Third Party Claim as
provided in the first sentence of this Section 9.07(b), to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, or (B) the employment of such counsel has been
specifically authorized in Writing by the Indemnifying Party, which authorization will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) The Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume the Third Party
Defense if:

(i) the Third Party Claim primarily seeks any injunctive or other equitable
relief;

(ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;

(iii) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party in respect of the Third Party Claim;

(iv) Buyer would be reasonably likely to be liable for the majority of the
Damages reasonably expected to result from such Third Party Claim by virtue of
the limitations set forth in Section 9.04(b);

(v) the Indemnifying Party has failed to prosecute or defend such Third Party
Claim within fifteen (15) days (or less, if the nature of the Third Party
Claim requires) following receipt of Written notice from the Indemnified Party
of such failure; or

(vi) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to prosecute the Third Party
Defense or the maximum foreseeable damages or amount that may be claimed
exceeds the Escrow Fund.

(d) If by reason of the Third Party Claim a Lien, attachment, garnishment or
execution is placed upon any of the property or assets of Buyer or any Target
Company, the Indemnifying Party, if it desires to exercise its right to assume
such Third Party Defense, must furnish a satisfactory indemnity bond to obtain
the prompt release of such Lien, attachment, garnishment or execution.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party assumes a Third Party Defense, it will act in
good faith in the defense, prosecution, or settlement of such Third Party
Claim or litigation and will hold all Indemnified Parties harmless from and
against all Losses caused by or arising out of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party will conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently, and the Indemnified Party will provide reasonable cooperation
in the defense of the Third Party Claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party is
reasonably conducting the Third Party Defense, the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior Written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party will have the right to
pay or settle any such Third Party Claim, provided, however, that in such
event it will waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party
for such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party will have consented to such payment or settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement except with the Written consent
of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the consent of the
Indemnified Party will not be required if all of the following conditions are
met:

(i) the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving to the Indemnified Parties by the third
party of a release of the Indemnified Parties from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim;

(ii) there is (A) no finding or admission of any violation of Law by the
Indemnified Parties (or any Affiliate thereof) or (B) no adverse effect on any
other Action or claims of a similar nature that may be made against the
Indemnified Parties (or any Affiliate thereof); and

(iii) the sole form of relief is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party.

(f) In the event that (i) an Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party fails or elects not to assume a
Third Party Defense that the Indemnifying Party had the right to assume under
this Section 9.07 or (B) the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the
Third Party Defense pursuant to this Section 9.07, the Indemnified Party will
have the right, with counsel of its choice, to defend, conduct and control the
Third Party Defense, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.
In each case, the Indemnified Party will conduct the Third Party Defense
actively and diligently, and the Indemnifying Party will provide reasonable
cooperation in the Third Party Defense. The Indemnified Party will have the
right to consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim on such terms as it may deem
appropriate; provided, however, that the amount of any settlement made or
entry of any judgment consented to by the Indemnified Party without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party will not be determinative of the validity of
the Third Party Claim, except with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnifying
Party does not elect to assume a Third Party Defense that it has the right to
assume hereunder, the Indemnified Party will have no obligation to do so.

Section 9.08 Procedures for Inter-Party Claims.

(a) In the event that an Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for
Damages against an Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a
Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall promptly give Written notice
(a "Claim Notice") thereof to the Indemnifying Party, specifying a non-binding
estimate of the amount of such claim (to the extent possible), the nature and
basis of the alleged breach giving rise to such claim and material facts and
circumstances known by the Indemnified Party relating thereto. The Indemnified
Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to its books
and records (and, if Seller is the Indemnifying Party, the Target Companies'
books and records) during normal business hours, and in a manner so as not to
interfere with the normal operation of the Business for the purpose of
allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any such
claim for Damages. (b) If the Indemnifying Party in good faith objects to any claim made by the
Indemnified Party in any Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party will
deliver a Written notice (a "Claim Dispute Notice") to the Indemnified Party
during the thirty (30) calendar day period commencing upon receipt by
Indemnifying Party of the Claim Notice. The Claim Dispute Notice will set
forth in reasonable detail the principal basis for the dispute of any claim in
the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver a Claim Dispute
Notice to the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)
calendar day period, then (i) each claim for indemnification set forth in such
Claim Notice will be deemed to have been conclusively determined in the
Indemnified Party's favor for purposes of this Article IX on the terms set
forth in the Claim Notice and (ii) if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer
Indemnified Party and cash remains in the Escrow Fund, then Buyer and Seller
shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to deliver cash from the Escrow Fund to
Buyer in accordance with herewith.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, then the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will attempt in good faith to
resolve any such objections raised by the Indemnifying Party in such Claim
Dispute Notice. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to a
resolution of such objection, then a memorandum setting forth the matters
conclusively determined by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
will be prepared and signed by both parties and, if the Indemnified Party is a
Buyer Indemnified Party and cash remains in the Escrow Fund, promptly deliver
joint Written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such
memorandum.

(d) If no such resolution can be reached during the forty-five (45) calendar
day period following the Indemnified Party's receipt of a given Claim Dispute
Notice, then upon the expiration of such forty-five (45) calendar day period,
either the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party may bring suit to
resolve the objection in accordance with Section 10.09 and Section 10.10.
Judgment upon any award rendered in accordance herewith may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction.

Section 9.09 Duty to Mitigate. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or otherwise reduce the amount of any Damages
that it incurs in connection with any matter with respect to which it is
entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant
to this Article IX, including taking commercially reasonable measures to
attempt to recover any insurance proceeds available to offset such Damages
under insurance policies maintained by the Indemnified Party (that is, the
Indemnified Party shall respond to such Damages in the same manner as it would
respond to such Damages in the absence of the indemnification provided for in
this Article IX). Upon payment of any Damages or the payment of any judgment
or settlement with respect to a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to the rights of the
Indemnified Party against any Person with respect to the subject matter of
such Damages or Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall assign or
otherwise cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the cost and expense of
such Indemnifying Party, to pursue any claims against, or otherwise recover
amounts from, any Person liable or responsible for any Damages for which
indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement. Section 9.10 Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Person shall be liable to or otherwise responsible for
consequential, special, indirect, incidental, punitive or exemplary damages,
or any damages measured by a multiple of earnings (except to the extent such
damages result from third party claims).

Section 9.11 Payment of Damages. No later than ten (10) Business Days
following the final determination of the amount of any Damages payable to an
Indemnified Party in accordance with this Article IX, Escrow Agent or the
applicable Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall pay to the
Indemnified Party, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in Writing by the Indemnified Party, the amount of such
Damages.

Section 9.12 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Following the Closing, any
payment made pursuant to this Article IX shall be treated by the Parties, for
U.S. federal income Tax and other applicable Tax purposes, as an adjustment to
the cash proceeds received by Seller in the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 9.13 Parent Guaranty.

(a) To the extent that Seller breaches its obligation to make payment of any
Damages owed to any Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with this Article
IX, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Buyer,
until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, the payment of Seller's
obligation to make such payment (the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Parties
and, solely for purposes of this Section 9.13, Guarantor acknowledge and agree
that Guarantor's obligations hereunder are subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9.04. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to
the Guaranteed Obligations, it does not have any right of recovery against,
and no personal liability shall attach to, any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member or affiliate (except for the sake of clarity, for (i) Seller or, (ii)
solely pursuant to a violation of this Section 9.13 by such Person, any holder
of stock, units or other equity interests in Guarantor (such holder in (ii)
being a "Guarantor Equity Holder")) of the Guarantor or any former, current or
future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner,
manager, member, affiliate (except for the sake of clarity, for Seller or,
solely pursuant to a violation of this Section 9.13 by such Person, such
Guarantor Equity Holder) of any of the foregoing (each of the foregoing, a
"Guarantor Affiliate"), through Seller or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate (or limited liability company or
partnership) veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Seller against any
other Guarantor Affiliate by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable
Law, or otherwise. Recourse against Guarantor under this Section 9.13 shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer and all of its Affiliates against
Guarantor or any Guarantor Affiliate in respect of any Damages arising under,
or in connection with, this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated
hereunder and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Nothing
set forth in this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereunder and
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall confer or give or
shall be construed to confer or give to any Person any rights or remedies
against any Person other than the Guarantor as expressly set forth herein. (b) A "Guarantor Transfer" shall be any sale of all or substantially all of
Guarantor's assets to an acquiring third party prior to the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date unless (a) Guarantor has validly assigned the
obligations under this Agreement to another third party which is creditworthy,
or (b) Buyer and Seller have mutually agreed upon a reasonable amount to be
deposited into escrow until the seventh anniversary of the Closing for
purposes of satisfying Guarantor's remaining obligations under this Agreement
and such deposit into escrow has been made by or on behalf Guarantor.
Guarantor shall not either effect a Guarantor Transfer or enter into any
agreement to do so. Guarantor shall give Buyer fourteen (14) calendar days'
notice of any proposed Guarantor Transfer and, if applicable, reasonable
information for Buyer to assess the creditworthiness of such proposed third
party acquirer or assignee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Guarantor agrees that Seller may seek injunctive relief against
Guarantor for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of this Section 9.13.

(c) The guaranty provided pursuant to this Section 9.13 shall terminate (and
the Guarantor shall have no further obligation hereunder) as of the earliest
of (i) such time as mutually agreed by the Guarantor, Seller and Buyer or (ii)
upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII hereof.

ARTICLE X 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.01 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section
6.08 (Directors' and Officers' Indemnification), Section 6.10(a) (Tax
Indemnification), Section 9.03 (Indemnification by Seller) and Section 9.05
(Indemnification by Buyer), this Agreement is not intended to, and shall not,
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.02 Remedies. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller and Buyer hereby agree that in the event either of Seller or Buyer
violates any provision of this Agreement, the remedies at Law available to
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, may be inadequate. In
such event, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall have
the right, in addition to all other rights and remedies it may have, to a
decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the
provisions of this Agreement by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, without posting any bond or other undertaking. It is explicitly
agreed that Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the
obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing and cause sufficient funds to be
provided and paid as contemplated by this Agreement in the event that all
conditions in Article 7 have been satisfied (or, with respect to certificates
to be delivered at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied upon the
Closing) at the time of the Closing. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges
that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of
this Agreement by any Party, money damages would be inadequate and the non-
breaching Party would have no adequate remedy at Law.

 Section 10.03 Waiver.

(a) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) no waiver that may
be given by a Party shall be applicable except in the specific instance for
which it is given; and (ii) no notice to or demand on one Party shall be
deemed to be a waiver of any right of the Party giving such notice or demand
to take further action without notice or demand. Except with respect to fraud,
all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract
or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or
relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made
only against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly
identified as Parties in the preamble to this Agreement or successors-in-
interest thereto (the "Contracting Parties") and the Guarantor with respect to
its obligations as set forth in Section 9.13.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.13, no Person who is not a
Contracting Party, including any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any
Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of
the foregoing (collectively, "Non-Recourse Persons"), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Non-Recourse
Persons.

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.13, without limiting the foregoing,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, (i) each Contracting Party hereby
waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action
that may otherwise be available at Law or in equity, or granted by statute, to
avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose
liability of a Contracting Party on any Non-Recourse Person, whether granted
by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality,
alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil,
unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (ii) each Contracting Party
disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Recourse Person with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement. Except for claims
against Seller arising under this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof,
Buyer shall not assert and shall cause the Target Companies and Buyer's
Affiliates not to assert any claim against any present or former director,
officer, employee or agent of Seller, for or with respect to any matter
relating to the Target Companies arising prior to Closing.

Section 10.04 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Disclosure
Schedule, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, Related Agreements and the
documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties, Written or oral, that may have
related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

Section 10.05 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations hereunder
without the prior Written approval of the other Party; provided that Buyer may
(i) assign any or all of its respective rights and interests hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates or to any lender providing financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) designate one or more of its
Affiliates to perform its respective obligations hereunder; provided, however,

each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any amendments
hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of digital imaging and
electronic mail or a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person.

inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.09 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 10.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.10.

Section 10.11 Dispute Resolution; Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) The Parties hereby agree that, in order to obtain prompt and expeditious
resolution of any disputes under this Agreement, each claim, dispute or
controversy solely seeking money damages in an amount not exceeding
$3,500,000, arising out of a claim for indemnification under Article IX or
arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to, the interpretation,
performance or breach of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any claim based on contract, tort or statute, or the
arbitrability of any claim hereunder (an "Arbitrable Claim"), will be settled
by final and binding arbitration conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). All such Arbitrable
Claims will be settled by three (3) arbitrators with at least fifteen (15)
years of experience with respect to complex commercial disputes. Such
arbitrators will be provided through AAA by mutual agreement of the Parties;
provided, that, if the Parties are not able to agree in good faith on the
identity of such arbitrators, the Parties agree that the arbitrators will be
appointed by AAA. No such arbitrator may have any preexisting, direct or
indirect relationship with any party to the dispute. Each Party expressly
consents to, and waives any future objection to, such forum and arbitration
rules. Judgment upon any award may be entered by any state or federal court in
the United States having jurisdiction thereof. Except as required by
applicable Laws (including, without limitation, the Laws, rules and
regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the
NASDAQ Stock Market), neither Party nor the arbitrators will disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
Written consent of all Parties. Adherence to this dispute resolution process
will not limit the right of the Parties to obtain any provisional remedy,
including injunctive or similar relief, from any court of competent
jurisdiction as may be necessary to protect their respective rights and
interests pending arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this
dispute resolution procedure is intended to be the exclusive method of
resolving any Arbitrable Claims. The arbitration procedures will follow the
substantive law of the State of Delaware, including the provisions of
statutory law dealing with arbitration, as it may exist at the time of the
demand for arbitration, insofar as said provisions are not in conflict with
this Agreement and specifically excepting therefrom sections of any such
statute dealing with discovery and sections requiring notice of the hearing
date by registered or certified mail. The arbitrators will determine the
prevailing party and will include in their award that party's reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs.

(b) Except as expressly stated in Section 10.11(a), each Party irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if
such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal or state court located in
the State of Delaware, for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each Party agrees to commence any such action, suit or proceeding either in
the Delaware Chancery Court or any federal or state court of the State of
Delaware. Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Party's respective address
set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction in this Section 10.11(b). Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in the Delaware Chancery Court or any federal or state
court of the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

Section 10.12 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended if, and only if, such amendment is in writing and is signed, by Buyer
and Seller. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other Party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party
to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No waiver by either
Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence. The failure of any Party to assert any of
