   2.4 |

_Purchase Price Allocation_ 

---|--- 
 

The parties hereto agree that within sixty (60) days after the determination
of the Final Closing Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall provide the Vendors
with an allocation schedule allocating the Purchase Price (plus other relevant
items) first among the Purchased Securities, and then among the assets of the
Conifex Holdco Subsidiaries and the adjusted gross-up basis among the assets
of El Dorado in accordance with the principles set forth on Schedule "D" to
this Agreement (the "Allocation Schedule"). Vendors shall complete their
review of the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after Vendors
receipt thereof. If Vendors wish to dispute any items in the Allocation
Schedule, the Purchaser and Vendors shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such disputed items in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.

Any adjustments to the Purchase Price made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
allocated in a manner consistent with Schedule "D". Each party hereto and
each of their respective Affiliates shall report, act and file all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594, IRS Form 8023, and IRS Form 8883) consistently with

Each of Purchaser and Vendors shall deliver to the other party a copy of its

The parties agree to provide each other with any information necessary to

with respect to the initiation of any Proceeding by any Taxation Authority
relating to the Allocation Schedule, and Vendors and Purchaser shall negotiate
in good faith how to resolve the same in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Schedule.



   2.5 |

_Purchase Price Details_ 

---|--- 
 

At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Vendors shall
provide to the Purchaser the Closing Payments Memorandum. 



   2.6 |

_Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and Adjustment_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

The Closing Payments Memorandum delivered in accordance with Section 2.5 will
set out in detail on an itemized basis, with reasonable supporting
documentation, the Vendors good faith estimate of the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, which shall be prepared and calculated on a basis consistent
with this Agreement. The Purchaser shall be entitled to attend and review any
inventory (including spares) counts in respect of the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital pursuant to this Section 2.6(a). 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare
and submit to the Vendors a statement setting forth the actual Net Working
Capital of the Conifex Group as of the Closing Date, which shall be prepared
and calculated on a basis consistent with this Agreement (the "Proposed Final
Closing Net Working Capital Statement"). For purposes of determining the
amount of inventory included in Net Current Assets to calculate the Net
Working Capital, the parties recognize and agree that the Purchaser may
conduct a physical count of inventory located at the Conifex Group Real
Property and in any warehouse at which any member of the Conifex Group stores
inventory within the five (5) days prior to or after the Closing, and the
Vendors shall be given at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice
of the date, time and location of each such count and shall be entitled to be
present for and observe each such count. The results of any stocktake
conducted for any particular measured item at a Conifex Group Mill
undertaken pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) shall be conclusive and shall be
used in the determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital in respect
of such measured item at such Conifex Group Mill. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

As soon as reasonably practicable after delivery of the Proposed Final Closing
Net Working Capital Statement (but not later than thirty (30) days
thereafter), the Vendors shall notify the Purchaser in writing if they dispute
any aspect of the Proposed Final Closing Net Working Capital Statement and
shall set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail, the reasons for their
objections and the amounts involved (and shall include reasonable supporting
documentation). If the Vendors fail to deliver a notice of objection within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the  

---|---|--- 
 



19

         |

 Proposed Final Closing Net Working Capital Statement, they shall be deemed
to have accepted the Proposed Final Closing Net Working Capital Statement
prepared by the Purchaser and the Proposed Final Closing Net Working Capital
Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. 

---|--- 



     | (d) |

If any notice of objections is timely delivered by the Vendors as set forth
above, items as to which there is no disagreement shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. If the parties cannot resolve the disputed items
within thirty (30) days after the delivery of such notice of objection, such
disputed items shall be referred by the Vendors and the Purchaser to the
Accountants for resolution in accordance with this Section. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

The Accountants shall review only those items in dispute and any determination
of the Accountants shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Vendors and
the Purchaser and shall be made within thirty (30) days of having received a
signed engagement letter by Vendors and Purchaser. The Vendors on the one hand
and Purchaser on the other shall each fund 50% of any required retainer of
the Accountants (subject to reimbursement following the final determination of
which party is responsible for the fees and expenses of the Accountants in
accordance with this Section). The Accountants shall be instructed that (i)
the determination of any disputed items shall be limited to the range of
values proposed by the Vendors in the notice of objection and by the Purchaser
in the Proposed Final Closing Net Working Capital Statement and (ii) its
review shall be limited to determining whether the disputed items were
calculated in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The Accountants shall
prepare and deliver to the Vendors and the Purchaser a written report
explaining its determination. The determination of the Accountants shall be
based solely on written submissions by the Vendors and the Purchaser and shall
not be based on any independent review by the Accountants. The fees and
expenses of the Accountants will be paid by the party whose positions were
furthest, in the aggregate, from the aggregate amount of all disputed items
determined by the Accountants. The Proposed Final Closing Net Working Capital
Statement as finally determined (whether by failure of the Vendors to deliver
timely notice of objection as set forth above, by agreement of the Vendors and
the Purchaser, or by determination of the Accountants) is referred to herein
as the "Final Closing Net Working Capital".  

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital, then within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Vendors shall pay to
the Purchaser the amount of such difference. If the Final Closing Net Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, then
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of Closing Net Working
Capital, Purchaser shall pay to the Vendors the amount of such difference
(allocated in accordance with the Allocation Schedule). Any payment made
pursuant to this Section shall be referred to as the "Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment Payment". Any payments pursuant to this Section 2.6(f)
shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for income
Tax purposes. 

---|---|--- 
 



20

       2.7 |

_Withholding_ 

---|--- 
 

Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable by it pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any Tax Law. In the event that any amount is so deducted and withheld,
such amount will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been timely paid to the Person to whom the payment from which such withheld
amount was made.

of securing to the other party hereto the benefits contemplated by this
Agreement. Furthermore, until Closing, Vendors shall reasonably assist
Purchaser so that Purchaser can prepare, as promptly as practicable, any
financial statements that Resolute Forest Products Inc. is required to file
pursuant to Form 8-K, Rule 3-05 or Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents of its auditor(s) with
respect thereto as may be required by applicable SEC regulations. The
Purchaser agrees to promptly reimburse Conifex and the Vendors, as the case
may be, for their documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with the covenants in the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



   4.5 |

_Casualty_ 

---|--- 
 

If any of the Business Assets suffers a Casualty Event prior to the Closing,
Vendors shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of such fact. If the
damage, destruction or other Casualty to the Business Assets renders the
affected Business Asset unusable for the purposes to which it was applied to
the Business as Presently Conducted (a "Casualty Event"), then the
parties, acting reasonably, shall retain a mutually agreed upon, qualified
independent third party appraiser to provide a report providing the estimated
expense required to repair, replace or restore the Business Assets so affected
to its condition immediately prior to such Casualty Event, including the cost
of any related business interruption from the date of the report forward (the
"Replacement Cost"). Purchaser and Vendors shall each bear fifty percent (50%)
of the costs of such appraiser. Purchaser shall, at its option, within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the foregoing report, either (i) require Vendors
to transfer the portion of applicable Insurance Proceeds for the Business
Assets and business interruption (but, as to business interruption Insurance
Proceeds, only those applicable to periods after the Closing Date, if any) to
Purchaser at Closing (for the avoidance of doubt, including any such Insurance
Proceeds payable to an Affiliate of the Conifex Group), or (ii) reduce the
Purchase Price by the Replacement Cost as determined by the appraiser. In the
event the Purchaser makes the election in subparagraph (ii) of this Section,
all Insurance Proceeds related to the Casualty Event shall be for the sole
benefit and account of the Vendors, and, to the extent that any of the same
are received by the Purchaser or any member of the Conifex Group for any
reason, whether before or after Closing, such Insurance Proceeds shall be
preserved for and shall be for the benefit of the Vendors without setoff or
deduction of any kind whatsoever so that the total amount of such Insurance
Proceeds shall be available to the Vendors. For greater certainty, if 

 



28

    

 such Insurance Proceeds are received by the Purchaser or the Conifex Group
after Closing, then the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Conifex Group,
as the case may be, shall pay such Insurance Proceeds to the Vendors within
three (3) Business Days of receipt thereof.



   4.6 |

_Negotiation_ 

---|--- 
 

From and after the date hereof until the Closing or earlier termination
hereof, no Vendor, nor any Affiliate of any Vendor, nor any of
their respective officers, directors or other Representatives, nor anyone
acting on behalf of any Vendor or such Persons shall, directly or indirectly,
(a) encourage, solicit, engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to, any Person (other than Purchaser or its Representatives),
or accept, endorse or enter into, or publicly propose to accept, endorse or
enter into, any agreement, understanding or arrangement with any Person,
concerning (i) any purchase, sale or lease of any assets (other than
inventory in the Ordinary Course) of any Vendor or of any member of the
Conifex Group (including any of the Purchased Securities or any Business
Assets), (ii) any purchase or sale of shares of capital stock, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock, of any member of the
Conifex Group, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
reorganization, combination, recapitalization, or similar transaction
involving any member of the Conifex Group or the Vendors, or any other
transaction inconsistent with the transactions contemplated hereby; (b)
initiate or continue any existing discussions, negotiations or other
communications (including access to any data room and to any confidential
information) with any Person concerning any merger, sale of any assets,
purchase or sale of shares of capital stock or similar transaction involving
the Vendors, the Conifex Group, the Business, any of the Business Assets or
any other transaction inconsistent with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (c) waive, release or amend, each confidentiality, standstill, non-
disclosure, non-solicitation or similar agreement, restriction or covenant to
which the Vendors or any of their Affiliates are a party.



   4.7 |

_Intercompany Transactions_ 

---|--- 
 

All intercompany and related party (a) trade payables and Accounts Receivable
and (b) loan payables and loan receivables (including outstanding principal
amounts and interest), in each case, between the Conifex Group (or any of
them) on the one hand and the Vendors (or either of them) or any of their
Affiliates (other than members of the Conifex Group) on the other hand
(all such payables and receivables, the "Intercompany Transactions"), shall
be paid in full and finally settled, and the underlying intercompany and
related party loan agreements shall be terminated by agreements executed and
effective prior to the Closing, such agreements to be reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser, and which shall include a complete release of each member of the
Conifex Group from all liability related to such Intercompany Transactions
(the "Intercompany Transaction Release Agreements"). Conifex shall provide
Purchaser with the structure of any such settlement and the form of any
Intercompany Transaction Release Agreement at least five (5) Business Days
prior to settlement or the execution thereof. If the structure of such
settlement or any provision of such agreement would have an adverse tax,
financial or other effect on any member of the Conifex Group, in the
reasonable opinion of Purchaser, then Purchasers prior written consent to
such settlement transaction or agreement shall be required prior to the
settlement or execution thereof.

To the extent that any asset used in the Business is owned by an Affiliate of
a member of the Conifex Group (but excluding other members of the Conifex
Group), Vendors shall cause such Affiliate to assign and transfer such asset
to a member of the Conifex Group prior to Closing, and shall pay any cost,
charge or Tax related to such transfer.

 



29

       4.8 |

_Notice of Breach_ 

---|--- 
 

Vendors shall promptly provide Purchaser with written notice with respect to
any matter of which it becomes aware after the date hereof that constitutes a
breach of its representations and warranties hereunder such that the Vendors
would be unable to meet the closing conditions herein. Any such notice shall
not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the
indemnification or termination rights contained in this Agreement or of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) have
been satisfied.

 



   4.9 |

_Environmental Matters_ 

---|--- 
 

Vendors acknowledge that Purchaser may wish prior to the Closing Date to send
a letter of intent to the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality
("ADEQ") as a prospective purchaser to participate in a voluntary cleanup
program for the Conifex Group Real Property of El Dorado as part of Arkansass
Brownfields Program administered under Ark. Code Ann. § 8-7-1101 et seq. and
Regulation 29 of the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission.
Purchaser shall at all times have the right to petition or request ADEQ
with respect thereto, and Vendors shall promptly and in good faith reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser in furtherance of Purchasers efforts.

 

In connection therewith, each Vendor grants to Purchaser and its
Representatives the right, permission and reasonable access to the
Conifex Group Real Property of El Dorado to inspect any and all conditions of
said property at any time before the Effective Time, including but not limited
to for the purposes of reviewing physical and environmental conditions,
provided that such access shall not involve taking tests of any kind, samples
of any kind, cores or boring of any kind, and/or conducting a survey or
surveys of the property without the prior written consent of Vendors (which
consent may be withheld by Vendors in their sole discretion). Each Vendor
agrees to be reasonably available to Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives
for the purpose of assisting Purchaser in Purchasers review of the property,
and to provide any information reasonably requested in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the exchange of any
information with ADEQ as may be necessary to comply with the legal
requirements of such program shall not violate the Confidentiality Agreement
or confidentiality provision contained herein or in any other Transaction
Document. The Purchaser agrees to keep the Vendors reasonably informed of all
meetings and discussions with ADEQ in connection with the matters set forth in
this Section 4.9, shall permit the Vendors to review any material
communication received by Purchaser from ADEQ in connection herewith, and
shall provide Vendors an advance written copy of all material communications
and filings pursuant to such program. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate
with Vendors to address any reasonable concerns the Vendors may have
concerning Purchasers application to the extent such application would
reasonably likely adversely affect Conifex or the Conifex Groups
Confidential Information.

ARTICLE 5

 

OTHER COVENANTS



   5.1 |

_Taxes_ 

---|--- 



      | (a) |

The Purchaser does not assume and will not be liable for any Taxes which may
be or become payable by either Vendor, including any Taxes resulting from or
arising as a consequence of the sale by such Vendor to the Purchaser of the
Purchased Securities herein contemplated including, but not limited to, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes,
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall
be paid by such Vendor when due. The Vendors shall, jointly and severally, pay
and indemnify the Purchaser, each member of the Conifex Group, and all of
their respective Affiliates for (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of
any Conifex Group member for any and all Tax periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (and with respect to any Tax period that includes the Closing
Date but does not end on the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax period
prior to and including the Closing Date), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an
Affiliated Group of which any Conifex Group member is or was a member on or
prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-6 (or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign Law or
regulation), (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on a Conifex Group
member as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law,
rule, or regulation to the extent such Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring on or before the Closing Date, (iv) any Taxes resulting from any
election by a Conifex Group member under Code §108(i) or Code §965(h) on or
prior to the Closing Date, (v) all Taxes imposed on a Conifex Group member
pursuant to Section 951 or 951A of the Code for any Tax periods prior to the
Closing Date, and (vi) all Taxes imposed on a Conifex Group member as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including the
employer portion of any employment taxes on any compensation; except in each
case to the extent the same was accrued as a liability in the calculation of
the Final Closing Net Working Capital. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

The Vendors shall cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis all Tax
Returns required for any member of the Conifex Group consistent with past
practice for any period which ends on or before the Closing Date and for which
Tax Returns have not been filed as of such date and shall timely pay when due
all Taxes shown as payable with respect to such Tax Returns. Prior to filing,
the Vendors shall provide to the Purchaser for its review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, a copy of
any such Tax Returns. The Vendors shall not amend any Tax Return that
includes a member of the Conifex Group without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Conifex USA shall be treated as the owner of El Dorado and
Conifex Holdco shall be treated as the owner of the Conifex Holdco
Subsidiaries through the end of the Closing Date for all Tax Purposes. To the
extent permissible under applicable Laws, the parties agree to elect (and have
the Conifex Group members elect) to have each Tax year of each Conifex Group
member end on the Closing Date. To the extent that any Tax relates 

---|---|--- 
 



31

         |

 to a Tax period that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date,
the amount allocated to the period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (i) in
the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis, the Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) for all other Taxes
(including income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes),
determined as if the Conifex Group member filed a separate Tax Return with
respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Tax period ending as of the end
of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology." In
the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes, the amount shall be
allocated at Closing on the basis of the actual Taxes for the year, if known,
or if unknown, on the basis of the most recent ascertainable Taxes, but in
either case based on the maximum allowable discount for early payment and
subject to adjustment based on the actual tax bill (the "Estimated Closing
Real Estate Taxes"). If not yet due and payable, the Estimated Closing Real
Estate Taxes shall be deducted from the Purchase Price at Closing, and
Purchaser shall pay all such Taxes when they become due and payable and,
promptly thereafter, the parties shall re-prorate such Taxes with, if any
amount is due, an appropriate payment from one party to the other on the basis
of the amount of such Taxes then due and payable. 

---|--- 



     | (c) |

Neither the Purchaser, any member of the Conifex Group, nor any Affiliate
thereof may (i) file, amend or modify an income Tax Return of any member of
the Conifex Group, (ii) file or amend or revoke any income Tax election of any
member of the Conifex Group, or (iii) take any action that would extend the
applicable statute of limitations for any income Taxes or income Tax Return
of any member of the Conifex Group, in each case, for a taxable period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the
Vendors, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Purchaser and the Vendors agree that the sale of the Conifex Holdco
Subsidiaries shall be treated as a sale and purchase of assets for all Tax
purposes. At the election of Purchaser, Conifex USA and Purchaser will jointly
make a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding election under applicable state, local, or foreign Tax Law)
with respect to the El Dorado Shares (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election").
Conifex USA and Purchaser will file all Tax Returns consistent with such
Section 338(h)(10) Election and agree not to take any action that could cause
such Section 338(h)(10) Election to be invalid, and will not take any position
contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a determination (as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state, foreign or local
income Tax provision). Purchaser will prepare copies of IRS Form 8023,
including any schedules thereto, and any similar state, local or foreign forms
(collectively, the "Section 338 Forms") as may be required, and Conifex USA
will provide fully executed Section 338 Forms on the Closing Date. The parties
also shall cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and
appropriate (including filing such additional forms, Tax Returns, elections,
schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve the
Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (and comparable provisions of each
applicable state, foreign and local Law) or any successor provisions. 

---|---|--- 
 



32

       5.2 |

_Employees_ 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

Except as otherwise provided below, Vendors shall transfer or assign all of
the Conifex Group Employee Plans (whether sponsored or maintained by a member
of the Conifex Group or by a Vendor or one of its Affiliates), to a Vendor or
an Affiliate of a Vendor (other than any member of the Conifex Group) without
any further liability whatsoever to the Conifex Group, whether absolute,
contingent or accrued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of up to
twenty-one (21) days after the date hereof, Purchaser in its sole discretion
may elect, by written notice to Vendors, that upon Closing the Vendors shall
transfer or assign some or all of the Conifex Group Employee Plans (whether
sponsored or maintained by a member of the Conifex Group or by a Vendor or one
of its Affiliates) to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including, for
purposes of this Section, a member of the Conifex Group). 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

In the event that Purchaser does not assume any Conifex Group Employee Plan
that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, the
Vendors shall cause each Conifex Group Business Employee to be fully vested in
his or her account thereunder and to receive a pro-rata allocation of any
matching or profit sharing contribution made to its 401(k) plan after the
Closing which relates to any period prior to Closing. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Immediately following the Closing, Purchaser agrees to provide, or cause its
Affiliates (including the Conifex Group) to provide, to those individuals who
continue in employment with the Conifex Group immediately following the
Closing (the "Continuing Employees") (i) a base salary that is no less than
that provided to such Continuing Employee by the Conifex Group immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) health and welfare benefits (other than
severance or any other voluntary health and welfare benefits (or voluntary
portion of such benefits) in which Conifex Group, a Vendor or one their
Affiliates do not pay for any portion of the underlying benefits or premiums)
commensurate, in the aggregate, with the health and welfare benefits provided
to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (x) be a
guarantee of employment for any such Continuing Employee for any period
following the Closing, or (y) restrict the right of the Purchaser and
its Affiliates (including the Conifex Group) to terminate the employment of
any Continuing Employee for any reason. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

With respect to any employee benefit and compensation plans, programs and
arrangements provided to employees of the Purchaser and its Affiliates
("Purchaser Plans") in which, in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.2(c), employees of the Conifex Group participate or become eligible to
participate following the Closing, the Purchaser will, or will cause the
Conifex Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) with respect to
any "welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, waive
any pre-existing condition exclusion in any Purchaser Plan for any condition
for which any such Continuing Employee 

---|---|--- 
 



33

         |

 would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Conifex Group
Employee Plan; (ii) with respect to any "welfare benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA, cause a waiver of any waiting period in any Purchaser
Plans in which any such Continuing Employee may be entitled to participate
that exceeds the corresponding waiting period under the corresponding Conifex
Group Employee Plan (after taking into account the service credit provided
for herein for purposes of satisfying such waiting period); and (iii)
recognize all continuous service of all such Continuing Employees with the
Conifex Group immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting credit in any Purchaser Plan in which
such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service shall be credited to the
extent that it would result in duplication of benefits; _provided_ , _further_
, _however_ , that no such service shall be credited with respect to any
defined benefit plan or retiree medical plan. Nothing contained herein
shall require the Purchaser or shall cause the Purchaser Plans to credit
Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) for any deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Closing Date under any
applicable Conifex Group Employee Plan for purposes of satisfying, in the
partial or full plan year of initial participation, applicable deductible,
co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses under any applicable Purchaser
Plan with respect to the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. 

---|--- 



   5.3 |

_Confidentiality;_ _Non-solicitation_   

---|--- 



     | (a) |

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement remains
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (and shall be, and
shall be deemed to be, binding on the Purchaser as an original signatory
thereto) during the period from the execution hereof until the Closing. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect at the Closing,
provided that Purchaser agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue to apply in full force and effect to confidential information
received thereunder by the Purchaser not concerning the Conifex Group or the
Business, if any. From and after the Closing, each Vendor shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold, in
confidence (and not disclose or provide access to any other Person) any and
all information, whether written or oral, concerning the Conifex Group or the
Business, except to the extent that such Vendor can show that such information
(a) is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of
such Vendor or its Affiliates (including the Conifex Group) or
Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by such Vendor or its Affiliates
or Representatives from and after the Closing from sources unaffiliated with
the Purchaser or the Conifex Group which are, to the Vendors knowledge, not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation. If any Vendor or its Affiliates or Representatives
are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law, Vendors shall promptly notify
Purchaser in writing (if permitted by Law) and shall disclose only that
portion of such information which Vendors are advised by its counsel in
writing is legally required to be disclosed; provided, however, that Vendors
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate
protective Order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information. 

---|---|--- 
 



34

         | (b) |

From the Closing Date until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
Vendors shall not, and shall cause each of their Affiliates not to, solicit
or attempt to solicit any Conifex Group Business Employee (or any individual
who was an employee or consultant of any member of the Conifex Group during
the six (6) months prior to Closing) for employment or in any other capacity
(including as an independent contractor or consultant) with either Vendor or
any of their Affiliates. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any
solicitation directed at the public or industry participants in general by
the Vendors or their Affiliates or any recruiting or executive search firm,
provided that such firm was not encouraged or instructed by the Vendors or
their Affiliates to undertake the solicitation of specific persons
otherwise prohibited under this paragraph. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Each party agrees and acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 5.3
(collectively, the "Restrictive Covenants") have been separately bargained
for to protect the Purchaser and its businesses, including goodwill, and from
and after the Closing, the Business, and ensure that the parties hereto shall
have the full benefits of their agreements under this Agreement. Each party
hereto recognizes that that the Restrictive Covenants constitute an important
part of the consideration being provided under this Agreement, that such
covenants are necessary in order to protect and maintain the legitimate
business interests of the Purchaser and are fair and reasonable in all
respects, and that the Purchaser would not consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby but for such agreements. Each Vendor further acknowledges
and agrees that a substantial and legally sufficient portion of the Purchase
Price is attributable to the Restrictive Covenants. The parties further
acknowledge and agree that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable and
provide no more protection than is reasonably necessary to protect the
Purchasers legitimate business interest. Each Vendor hereby waives any right
to assert inadequacy of consideration as a defense to enforcement of the
Restrictive Covenants should such enforcement ever become necessary. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

If either Vendor or any of its Affiliates breaches, or threatens to commit a
breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, the Purchaser shall have, in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to it
under Law or in equity, the right to have the Restrictive Covenants
specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, without any
requirement to post bond or other security, it being agreed that any breach or
threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable injury
to the Purchaser and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy.
Each Vendor covenants and agrees not to oppose any demand for specific
performance or injunctive or other equitable relief in case of any such breach
or attempted breach. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

If any provision of this Section 5.3 as applied to any part or to any
circumstances shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other provision
of this Section 5.3, the application of such provision in any other
circumstances, or the validity or enforceability of this Section 5.3. The
parties intend this Section 5.3 to 

---|---|--- 
 



35

         |

 be enforced as written. If any provision, or part thereof, however, is held
to be unenforceable because of the duration or scope thereof, the parties
agree that the Governmental Authority making such determination shall have
the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, and/or to delete
specific words or phrases and in its reduced form such provision shall then be
enforceable. 

---|--- 
 



   5.4 |

_Use of_ _Name_ 

---|--- 
 

From and after the Closing, neither of the Vendors nor any of their Affiliates
shall at any time use the name "El Dorado," "Navcor," "Suwanee," "Caddo
River," "Glenwood," or "Cross City" or any derivations thereof without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent may be withheld in
Purchasers sole discretion for any reason or for no reason.



   5.5 |

_Conifex Guaranteed Obligations_ 

---|--- 
 

(a) Conifex hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Purchaser
and its Affiliates the due and punctual payment and performance by each
Vendor (and any permitted assignees thereof) of any and all obligations and
liabilities of such Vendor under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents (subject to the terms and conditions hereof and thereof), including
all costs of collection and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred by Purchaser in enforcing the terms thereof and of this Section 5.5
(the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The foregoing sentence is an absolute,
unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual discharge and
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, and is a guaranty of payment, not
collection. Should a default occur in the discharge or performance of all or
any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations when due, the obligations of
Conifex hereunder shall become immediately due and payable. Conifex further
agrees that it shall not take any action (or refrain from taking any action)
with the intent to, or that is designed to, hinder or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, or which could reasonably be expected
to result in such hindrance or delay.

 

(b) This guarantee shall not be impaired whatsoever by any modification or
other alteration of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, including the
modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any obligation of
Conifex or any Vendor under this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents.
The liability of Conifex is direct and unconditional and may be enforced
without requiring Purchaser first to resort to any other right, remedy or
security. Conifex hereby waives any defense of either Vendor or any other
Person of any kind and the right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity
whatsoever, and any right of recourse to security for the debts and
obligations of either Vendor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid
in full, and waives any notice of acceptance; presentment and protest of any
instrument, and notice thereof; notice of default; and all other notices to
which each might otherwise be entitled. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the
liability of Conifex hereunder except the full payment and performance of all
of the Guaranteed Obligations to Purchaser or its Affiliates. Upon the filing
of any Proceeding relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization (in
each case, whether voluntary or involuntary) of Conifex or any of its
Affiliates, or any assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar
event with respect to Conifex or any of its Affiliates, any and all present
and future debts and obligations of any Vendor to Conifex are hereby waived
and postponed in favor of, and subordinated to, the full payment and
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(c) Conifex further agrees that this guarantee shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or
performance of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or
otherwise must be restored by Purchaser to either Vendor or to the creditors
of a Vendor or any representative of a Vendor or representative of its
creditors upon the

 



36

    

 insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Vendor, or to Conifex or the
creditors of Conifex or any representative of Conifex or representative of the
creditors of Conifex upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
Conifex, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

ARTICLE 7

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

ARTICLE 8

CONDITIONS TO CLOSING



   8.1 |

_Mutual Conditions_ 

---|--- 
 

The obligations of the parties hereunder are subject to the following mutual
conditions precedent which are for the benefit of each of the parties hereto:



     | (a) |

No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any Law or Order which is in effect and has the effect of making the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise restraining
or prohibiting the consummation of such transactions, or causing any of the
transactions contemplated hereunder to be rescinded following completion

RandW INSURANCE POLICY



   10.1 |

_Survival_ 

---|--- 
 

The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate
on Closing (except as provided in this Section 10.1), it being understood and
agreed that none of the Vendors, the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates or their respective directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents or Representatives shall have recourse under this Agreement following
the consummation of the Closing for any Losses for breach of or inaccuracy in
any such representation or warranty, except

 



41

    

 for (a) Claims based on Fraud (based solely on the representations and
warranties in Articles 6 and 7), which shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations period imposed by applicable Law, and
(b) Claims based on the Vendors Fundamental Representations and Warranties
and the Purchasers Fundamental Representations and Warranties, in each case,
which shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year. All covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement, including those requiring
performance from and after the Closing, shall survive the Closing and shall
continue in accordance with their terms. No claims for indemnification for
the breach of the Vendors Fundamental Representations and Warranties or the
Purchasers Fundamental Representations and Warranties pursuant to this
Section 10 may be made by any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement
following the end of the applicable survival period for such representation or
warranty, except that, if notice of the intent to seek indemnification
hereunder has been given to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the
terms hereof or a claim for indemnification has been made, prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period, the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligations hereunder shall continue as to any such matter
until the liability of the Indemnifying Party shall have been determined in
accordance with this Article 10\.



   10.2 |

_R andW Insurance Policy_ 

---|--- 
 

The parties acknowledge that, as of the date hereof, Purchaser has obtained
the RandW Insurance Policy. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the RandW
Insurance Policy shall at all times provide that: (a) the insurer shall have
no, and shall waive and not pursue any and all subrogation rights against the
Vendors except for fraud (as defined in such policy) based solely on
the representations and warranties in Article 6; (b) the Vendors are a third
party beneficiary of such waiver; and (c) the Purchaser shall not amend the
RandW Insurance Policy in any manner that would result in liability to the
Vendors (including with respect to the subrogation provisions) without the
Vendors express written consent, which may be granted or withheld in Vendors
sole discretion. At such times as required by the RandW Insurance Policy,
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall be solely liable for, all
costs and expenses related to the RandW Insurance Policy, including the total
premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commission for Purchasers broker,
Taxes related to such policy and other fees and expenses of such policy. For
the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by the Vendors contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered by such Person at Closing (other than a Claim
for Fraud or breach of the Vendors Fundamental Representations and
Warranties), the RandW Insurance Policy is the sole and exclusive source to
satisfy any claim for such indemnification by a Purchaser Indemnitee, and the
Vendors and their directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents and
Affiliates shall have any liability or other obligations with respect to such
indemnification.

harmless against Losses suffered or incurred directly or indirectly by the
Purchaser Indemnitees, which arise out of or are in respect of any: (i) breach
or inaccuracy of any of the Vendors Fundamental Representations and
Warranties; (ii) breach of or failure by any Vendor to carry out,
perform, satisfy and discharge any covenants or agreements made by such
Vendor in this Agreement; (iii) the Tax matters described in Section 5.1(a);

warranties in Articles 6).

The Purchaser Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3
and the Vendors right to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.4 are each
subject to the following limitations:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Indemnifying
Party shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for

competent jurisdiction in connection with a claim made by a third party. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

The total liability of the Vendors pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

---|---|--- 



   10.6 |

_Indemnification Notice_ 

---|--- 
 

Promptly upon obtaining knowledge of any claim, event, fact or demand which
gives rise to, or is reasonably expected to give rise to, a claim for
indemnification hereunder, any party seeking indemnification under Sections
10.3 or 10.4, as applicable, (an "Indemnified Party") shall give written
notice of such claim or demand ("Notice of Claim") to the party or parties
from which indemnification is sought (collectively, an "Indemnifying Party"),
setting forth the amount of the claim, if known. The Indemnified Party shall
furnish to the Indemnifying Party, in reasonable detail, such information as
it may have with respect to such indemnification claim (including copies of
any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on it and
any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing
or asserting the same). No failure or delay by the Indemnified Party in the
performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation
of any Indemnifying Party to indemnify, defend and hold the Indemnified Party
harmless, except to the extent that such failure or delay shall have
materially adversely affected the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against, settle, mitigate or satisfy any Loss for which the Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

 



43

       10.7 |

_Indemnification Procedure_ 

---|--- 
 

If the claim or demand set forth in the Notice of Claim given by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.6 relates to a claim or demand
asserted by a third party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
elect (by notice in writing to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
after the date the Notice of Claim is deemed delivered pursuant to Section
10.6) to defend such third party claim or demand on behalf of the Indemnified
Party, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, if (i) the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges that it is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in full in respect of such claim or Proceeding, and (ii)
the third party claim involves only monetary damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief or any criminal or quasi criminal
liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend such third party claim
or demand, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying
Party and its agents and Representatives as reasonably requested all records
and other materials which are reasonably required in the defense of
such third party claim or demand and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate
with and assist the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such third party
claim or demand, subject to the reimbursement of the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of a request
by the Indemnifying Party to so cooperate. So long as the Indemnifying Party
is defending such third party claim or demand in good faith, the Indemnified
Party shall not pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or demand
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to defend such third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense of such third party claim or
demand, at its own expense, provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party
does not elect to defend such third party claim or demand, does not defend
such third party claim in good faith and a timely manner, or if there are one
or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that conflict with
those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at
the Indemnifying Partys expense, to defend or participate in the defense of
such third party claim or demand. The Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to settle, compromise or discharge a third-party Claim, including any
Proceeding involving Taxes, without the consent of the Indemnified Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of a third-party Claim within thirty (30) days following receipt of a
Notice of Claim, the Indemnified Party, by notice to the Indemnifying Party,
may employ its own counsel and control the defense of the Third Party Claim
and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party, provided that in
any such case the Indemnified Party shall diligently and in good faith contest
such third-party Claim.



   10.8 |

_Effect of Indemnity Payments_ 

---|--- 
 

The parties agree to treat all payments made under the indemnity provisions of
Sections 10.3 and 10.4 as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes
to the extent allowable by Law and that such agreed treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof.



   10.9 |

_No Double Recovery_ 

---|--- 
 

No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from any Indemnifying Party
under the Transaction Documents more than once in respect of the same Loss
(notwithstanding that such Loss may result from breaches of multiple
provisions of the Transaction Documents).

 



44

    

Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the indemnity provided by the
Vendors in Section 10.3 shall exclude any amounts that are actually recovered
under the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy (whether such amounts are received
before or after Satisfaction by the Vendors of the indemnity).

 



   10.10 |

_No Materiality_ 

---|--- 
 

For purposes of this Article 10, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to
any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification
contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty,
except in the case of Vendors Fundamental Representations and Warranties,
Purchasers Fundamental Representations and Warranties, and Fraud.



   10.11 |

_Exclusive Remedy_ _; Right to Indemnification_ 

---|--- 
 

Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing,
except for (i) actions seeking equitable relief pursuant to Section 5.3(d) or
Section 12.12 and disputes under Sections 2.6, which disputes will be resolved
in accordance with such Sections, (ii) Claims for Fraud, and (iii) the rights
of the Purchaser and its Affiliates under the RandW Insurance Policy, its sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have against any other party hereto and its Affiliates and their
respective stockholders, members, managers, trustees, officers, directors,
employees, agents, Representatives, successors and assigns for claims arising
out of any breach of, non-fulfillment of or inaccuracy in any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained in this Agreement or in
any Closing certificate delivered hereunder, whether arising under or based
upon any Law or otherwise, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article 10\.

 

The right to indemnification, payment of Losses, termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 8, or other remedy based upon misrepresentation,
inaccuracy, or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
or obligations (and the right to rely on such representations, warranties
covenants, agreements, and obligations for all purposes including
measuring Losses) will not be affected by any act or omission of Purchaser or
any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement, or obligation or otherwise (including any past,
present, or future Law). The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant, agreement, or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and
obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the settlement of any amount under Section 2.6 shall not preclude
or diminish a claim under this Article 10, except to the extent that the same
would constitute a duplicative recovery.

The Disclosure Schedule and the Schedules referenced in this Agreement are
incorporated into this Agreement, and together with the other Transaction

hereunder and thereunder, and supersede all negotiations, representations,

This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only by a written
instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each of Purchaser and the

unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights
or obligations of any party under this Agreement will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b)
this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) the

by its severance herefrom.

other party to review such statement or release in advance of its issuance;
provided, however, that to the extent any specific disclosure is required by
