 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

  1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Target
and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and Target
shall be the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as
the " _Surviving Entity_ ") as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 92A.250 of Nevada
Revised Statutes (" _NRS_ ") (Chapter 92A of the Nevada Revised Statutes
being referred to herein as the " _Merger Act_ "), including the Surviving
Entitys succession to and assumption of all rights and obligations of Merger
Sub and Target.

  1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become
effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") upon the later of (i) the date and time
of filing of properly executed Articles of Merger relating to the Merger with
the Secretary of State of Nevada in accordance with the Merger Act (the "
_Articles of _ _Merger_ ") and (ii) at such later time as the parties shall
agree and set forth in such Articles of Merger. The Articles of Merger shall
be filed as soon as practicable on or prior to the Closing Date. with all applicable corporate, NYSE MKT LLC (" _NYSE MKT_ ") and TSX laws,
rules and regulations, take all actions necessary to cause the appointment of
three (3) existing members of the board of directors of Target to the board
of directors of Parent such that the board of directors of Parent is
constituted as provided in Section 7.13 of this Agreement as of the Effective
Time.

 

ARTICLE II

 

THE SURVIVING ENTITY

  2.1 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Entity at and after the Effective Time until thereafter amended in
accordance with the terms thereof and Chapter 78 of the NRS (the "
_Corporations Act_ "), provided that the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Entity will contain provisions with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and the advancement of expenses that are at least as
favorable, to the officers and directors of the Target, as those contained in
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Target, as amended and as in
effect on the date hereof.

  2.2 _Officers and Directors_. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of Merger Sub shall be the officers and directors
of the Surviving Entity until their respective successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Surviving Entitys articles of
incorporation, bylaws and the Corporations Act. 

 

ARTICLE III

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
capital stock described below:

 

 (a) All Target Common Shares that are held in Targets treasury or that are then owned by Parent shall be canceled and cease to exist and no cash, Parent capital stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

 

 (b)  Subject to Section 3.2(i) and Section 3.4, all issued and outstanding Target Common Shares (other than Target Common Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)) shall be automatically converted into and represent the right to receive Parent Common Shares, on the basis of 0.255 of a Parent Common Share for each one (1.0) Target Common Share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). All such Target Common Shares, when so converted, shall be retired, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, and the holder of (i) a certificate in the case of Target Physical Shares, or (ii) a statement of ownership in the case of Target Book-Entry Shares, that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented such Target Common Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender or transfer of such Target Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_ , the number of Parent Common Shares issuable therefor in accordance with the Exchange Ratio, without interest, and any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time, the Parent Common Shares or Target Common Shares are changed into a different number of shares or a different class because of any stock dividend or distribution, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such event. 

  (c)  The shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into shares of common stock of the Surviving Entity, such that the converted shares of common stock will represent all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Entity and will be held by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

 

 (d)  The Parent Common Shares issued upon the surrender or transfer of Target Common Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Target Common Shares formerly represented by any physical certificate or statement of ownership in book-entry form, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of Target Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

 

 3.2   _Surrender and Payment_. 

 

 (a)   _Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund_. Parent shall authorize one or more transfer agent(s) to act as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") with respect to the Merger. At and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, as depositary for the Parent Common Shares, or any successor depositary thereto, a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the aggregate number of Parent Common Shares to be issued in exchange for the Target Common Shares pursuant to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the applicable Parent Common Shares in exchange for the Target Common Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Section 3.2(d)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

 

 (b)   _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of Target Common Shares a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Target Physical Shares shall pass, only upon receipt of the Target Physical Shares by the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent and Target may reasonably specify), and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent (which may include the receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in connection with Target Book-Entry Shares), for use in the exchange contemplated by _Section 3.1_ and instructions for use in effecting the surrender or transfer of Target Common Shares for cancellation in accordance with this Agreement (together, the " _Exchange Instructions_ "). Upon surrender or transfer of Target Common Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the Exchange Instructions, the holder of such Target Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor Parent Common Shares (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or as otherwise agreed to by the Parent and Target) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2(i)_ , plus any amount payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_. 

  (c)   _Transferred Target Common Shares_. If any portion of the Parent Common Shares are to be issued to a Person other than the registered holder of Target Common Shares represented by the stock certificate(s) or statement of ownership surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor, no such issuance shall be made unless (i) the stock certificate(s) or statement of ownership so surrendered or transferred have been properly endorsed and contain any required Medallion Signature Guarantees and otherwise are in proper form for transfer, and (ii) the Person requesting such issuance has paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such issuance to a Person other than the registered holder or has established to the Exchange Agents satisfaction that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

 

 (d)   _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any un-surrendered or un-transferred Target Common Shares with respect to the Parent Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive until surrender or transfer of such Target Common Shares in accordance with _Sections 3.1 or 3.2(f)_. Following surrender or transfer of any Target Common Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of Parent Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) as soon as practicable after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Common Shares. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such Parent Common Shares were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

 

 (e)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Target Common Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Target Common Shares in accordance with this Section 3.2 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Parent to exchange such Target Common Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1_ or  _3.2(i)_ or to pay amounts to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d) . Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Target Common Shares for any such Parent Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 (f)  Subject to applicable abandoned or unclaimed property laws, any certificates formerly representing Target Common Shares that are not deposited with all other documents as provided in _Section 3.2(b)_ on or before the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time shall cease to represent any right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of the former shareholder of such Target Common Shares to receive certificates representing Parent Common Shares and the Target Common Shares otherwise issuable to such former Target shareholder shall be deemed to be surrendered to Parent together with all dividends or distributions thereon held for such shareholder. 

 

 (g)   _Lost Certificates_. If any Target Physical Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Target Physical Shares to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Target Physical Shares, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Target Physical Shares the Parent Common Shares payable in respect of the Target Physical Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate, without interest. 

  (h)   _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Target Common Shares such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent determine are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, such withholding of Parent Common Shares issued to any holder of Target Common Shares shall be an amount determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary to satisfy the Parents withholding obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Target Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. Parent and Target shall cooperate with and assist each other with efforts to reduce or eliminate such withholding Taxes. Parent will sell a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to satisfy the withholding obligation and the balance of any Parent Common Shares and any cash proceeds remaining after satisfaction of the withholding obligation shall be remitted to the holder. 

 

 (i)   _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or fractional Parent Common Shares or book-entry credit representing such fractional share interests shall be issued upon the surrender of Target Common Shares. Each holder of Target Common Shares exchanged pursuant to this _Article III_ (after taking into account all Target Common Shares delivered or transferred by such holder) who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a number of Parent Common Shares which is not a whole number shall receive the number of Parent Common Shares rounded to the nearest whole number (and, if the fraction is 0.5, the number of Parent Common Shares shall be rounded up to the next whole number). The parties acknowledge that rounding of fractional Parent Common Shares was not separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent Common Shares. 

 

 3.3 _Stock Options and Warrants_.

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, Parent and Target shall take all such action as may be necessary to cause each outstanding and unexpired and unexercised option to purchase Target Common Shares (a " _Target Stock Option_ ") granted under Targets 2005 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, as amended (collectively, the " _Target Stock Option Plan_ ") to be automatically converted at the Effective Time into options (the " _Substituted Options_ ") to purchase a number of Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Common Shares) equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Target Common Shares purchasable pursuant to such Target Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio at a price per Parent Common Share equal to the exercise price per Target Common Share specified in the Target Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio (such price rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Such Substituted Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting and expiry date, as the Target Stock Option in respect of which it is issued. Parent will assume all obligations under the Target Stock Option Plan as at the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time, and the Parent will comply with all of the terms and conditions of the Substituted Options, including the obligation to issue the Parent Common Shares contemplated thereby upon the exercise thereof. For purposes of vesting conditions, the date of grant of the Substituted Option shall be deemed to be the date on which the corresponding Target Stock Option was granted. Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall make all necessary amendments under the Target Stock Option Plan to provide that no further awards shall be made thereunder following the Closing. At and after the Effective Time, (i) all references in the Target Stock Option Plan and related stock option agreements to Target shall be deemed to refer to Parent and (ii) Parent shall assume all of Targets obligations with respect to the Target Stock Options as so amended. Substitution of the Target Stock Options for the Substituted Options will occur in compliance with Code Section 409A so that the substitution avoids being treated as the grant of new stock options. 

  (b)  Target Stock Options held by independent directors of Target (as defined by applicable Law), who are not officers or directors of Parent on Closing, shall expire on the earlier of (i) the current expiry date of such Target Stock Options (exclusive of the operation of the early termination provisions of such Target Stock Options) or (ii) six months after the Closing Date.

 

 (c) In respect of each Substituted Option, and the Parent Common Shares underlying such Substituted Option, Parent shall, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later than 30 days from the Closing Date, file a Form S-8 or other appropriate registration statement and use reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement current for as long as any Substituted Options remain outstanding. 

 

 (d) At the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of each warrant to purchase Target Common Shares issued by Target that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Target Warrants_ "), Target Warrants shall become exercisable into Parent stock in accordance with their terms. Parent acknowledges and shall assume the obligations under the Target Warrants and under each warrant indenture governing the Target Warrants (the " _Target Warrant Indentures_ ") to issue Parent Common Shares upon exercise of such Target Warrants and, if required by the Target Warrant Indentures, shall issue a warrant certificate to each holder of Target Warrants confirming such assumption. Consistent with the terms of the Target Warrants and Target Warrant Indentures, any such warrant certificate shall provide that such warrant shall be exercisable for a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Target Common Shares issuable in respect of such Target Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (the " _Assumed Warrants_ ") and that the exercise price of the Assumed Warrants will equal (i) the exercise price of the Target Warrants in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed Warrant shall, consistent with the terms of the Target Warrants and Target Warrant Indentures, contain appropriate provision such that the provisions of each Target Warrant (including the exercise period and the exercise price and provision for adjustment of the exercise price) shall thereafter be maintained in each such Assumed Warrant as nearly equivalent as may be practicable in relation to such Target Warrant. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in each such Assumed Warrant, including the obligation to issue the Parent Common Shares contemplated thereby upon exercise thereof.

 

 3.4   _Dissenting Shareholders._

 

 (a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the applicable requirements of Section 92A.120 of the Merger Act have been satisfied, Target Common Shares which were outstanding on the date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the Merger and which were voted against the Merger and the holders of which have demanded that the Target purchase such shares at their fair value in accordance with Sections 92A.300 through 92A.500 of the Merger Act and have not otherwise failed to perfect or shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to require such shares to be purchased for cash under the Merger Act (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive any Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(b), but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to have their shares purchased for cash at the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as agreed upon or determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections 92A.460 through 92A.500 of the Merger Act. 

  (b) If any shareholder who holds Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time effectively withdraws or loses (through passage of time, failure to demand or perfect, or otherwise) the right to demand and perfect dissenters rights under the Merger Act, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares that were Dissenting Shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Parent Common Shares pursuant to and subject to _Section 3.1(b)_ without interest thereon upon surrender of the Certificates representing such holders Target Common Shares. 

 

 (c) The Target shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written demands for purchase of any Target Common Shares pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to the Merger Act on the Target and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for purchase of any Target Common Shares pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights under the Merger Act. The Target shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for purchase of any shares of Target Common Shares pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights under the Merger Act, or settle or offer to settle any such demands.

As of the Closing Date, the foregoing Tax Returns were true and correct and prepared in compliance with applicable Law in all material respects. The unpaid Taxes of Target did not, as of the most recent fiscal month end, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the 2013 Target Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) and do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of Target in filing its Tax Returns, and such reserve fully accounts for all Tax accrued or accruing for all periods up to the date of such 2013 Target Balance Sheet.

No material deficiency or adjustment for any Taxes has been proposed, asserted, assessed or, to the Knowledge of Target, threatened, against Target. No claim has ever been made by a Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where Target does not file Tax Returns that Target is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Target, except Liens imposed by operation of law for current Taxes not yet delinquent.

  (k) Target has not participated, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011 -4(c) (or any predecessor of such Treasury Regulation), in (i) any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Code Section 6011 and the Treasury Regulation thereunder (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax Law) or (ii) any transaction required to be registered with the Internal Revenue Service under Code Section 6111 as in effect on or prior to December 31, 2013 and the Treasury Regulation thereunder (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax Law). 

 

 (l) Target is not a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of (i) any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code §280G (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law) and (ii) any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of Code §162(m) (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law).

  4.11 _Litigation_. Except as specifically disclosed in Section
4.11 of the Target Disclosure Letter, there is no suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to Targets Knowledge, threatened
against or directly affecting Target or any of the directors or officers of
Target in their capacity as such, nor is there any reasonable basis therefor,
that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Target if determined adversely to
Target or any such director or officer. Neither Target nor any officer,
director or employee of Target, has been permanently or temporarily enjoined
by any order, judgment or decree of any court or any other Governmental
Authority that names such Person from engaging in or continuing any conduct
or practice in connection with the business, assets or properties of Target
nor, to the Knowledge of Target, is Target or any officer, director
or employee of Target under investigation by any Governmental Authority.
There has not been, and to the Targets Knowledge, there is not pending or
contemplated, any investigation by the SEC involving the Target or any

 (j) None of Parent or its Subsidiaries will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date or (iii) an installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date. 

 

 (k)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011 -4(c) (or any predecessor of such Treasury Regulation), in (i) any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Code Section 6011 and the Treasury Regulation thereunder (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax Law) or (ii) any transaction required to be registered with the Internal Revenue Service under Code Section 6111 as in effect on or prior to December 31, 2013 and the Treasury Regulation thereunder (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax Law).

  (h) The board of directors of Target or the board of directors of Parent, as applicable, shall reaffirm its recommendation of the Transaction by news release promptly after: (i) any Acquisition Proposal (which is determined not to be a Superior Proposal) is publicly announced or made, (ii) the board of directors of Target (or the board of directors of Parent) determines that a proposed amendment to the terms of the Transaction and this Agreement would result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal and the other party has so amended the terms of the Transaction; or (iii) the written request of Parent (or Target) given on or within five Business Days ending the Business Day before a meeting of Target or Parent shareholders called to consider approving the Transaction. Parent, Target and their legal advisors shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form and content of any such news release and Target or Parent shall incorporate all reasonable comments made by the other party and its legal advisors. 

 

 (i) Each successive material modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2. 

 

 (j)  Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall prohibit Target or the Targets board of directors or Parent or Parents board of directors from (i) disclosing to the shareholders of Target or Parent, as applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act if the Targets board of directors or Parents board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided that making such disclosure shall not in any way limit or modify the effect, if any, that any such action has under this Section 7.2 (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by Target or Targets board of directors or Parent or Parents board of directors, as applicable, of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change). 

 

 7.3 _Cooperation_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from the Agreement Date until the Effective Time, each of Parent and Target shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other to report on their respective material operational matters and the general status of ongoing operations and each party shall promptly provide the other party or its counsel with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. 

 

 7.4 _Publicity_. Neither Target, Parent nor any of their respective affiliates or representatives shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Transactions other than a joint press release of Target and Parent announcing the execution of this Agreement or without the prior consultation of the other party, except as may be required by applicable Law, and each party shall use its reasonable efforts to provide copies of such release or other announcement to the other party hereto, and give due consideration to such comments as each such other party may have, prior to such release or other announcement. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 7.4 do not apply to (i) any announcement, document or publication in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) any disclosure by Target or Parent of any information concerning this Agreement or the Transactions in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions. 

  7.5 _Filings_. Each party shall make all filings such party is required to make in connection herewith or desirable to achieve the purposes contemplated hereby, including all required or advisable filings under or relating to the HSR Act, or the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, shall respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries or requests for information received from a Governmental Authority in relation to such filings or notices for additional information or documentation and shall cooperate as needed with respect to any such filings by any other party. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or appropriate to resolve the objections, if any, as may be asserted by the agencies or any other authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust or competition laws or regulations; provided that no party shall be required to take any action under this Section 7.5 that would, or would be reasonably likely to, materially frustrate the financial or other business benefits reasonably expected to be derived by such party from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Target shall be required to accept, as a condition to obtaining any required approval or resolving any objection of any Governmental Authority, any requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust (or the imposition of any other material condition or restriction with respect to) any of the respective businesses or assets of Parent, Merger Sub, Target or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 

 

 7.6 _Employee Matters_

 

 (a) On and after the Closing, until at least the 90th day after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide each employee of Target or any of its affiliates who is retained by the Surviving Entity or any of their affiliates following the Closing (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) salary that is not less than the Continuing Employees salary immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) the benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are currently provided to the Parents employees under Parents benefit plans, programs and arrangements. Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit under such plan for the last continuous period of service with Target and its affiliates prior to the Closing for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting in benefits and vacation and severance benefits, but for no other purpose (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the accrual of benefits); 

 

 (b) Parent agrees that, upon the Closing, each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate in Parents group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) (and Parent shall cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre- existing condition limitations under such plan), and such Continuing Employee shall be credited towards the deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions, imposed under such group health plan, for the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs, with any applicable expenses already incurred during the portion of the year preceding the Closing Date under the applicable group health plans of the Company; provided, however, such obligation of Parent is contingent on Target furnishing sufficient information in sufficiently usable form to enable Parent to reasonably administer its plan. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity or relevant affiliate to, credit to the Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any of Targets vacation policies as of the Closing Date; 

  (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity or relevant affiliate to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all change in control and termination agreements (including any change in control provisions therein) set forth in Section 4.17 of the Target Disclosure Letter applicable to employees of the Target arising from completion of the Transactions in the same manner and to the same extent that Target would be required to perform and honor such agreements if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not been consummated. Provided, however, that to the extent that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any other affiliate of Parent offers employment to any employee of the Target following completion of the Merger, such employment shall be on terms concerning future changes of control and termination agreed to between the employee and Parent or its affiliate that are consistent with the terms currently in effect for the employees of the Parent and its affiliates.

 

 7.7 _Preparation of the Form F-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. 

 

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and Target shall each promptly prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary version of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Parent will prepare and file with the SEC the Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. 

 

 (b) Each of Parent and Target will use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC in connection therewith and to furnish all information required to prepare the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the final Form F-4. 

 

 (c) Each of Parent and Target shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing.

 

 (d)  Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Shares in the Merger and Target shall furnish all information concerning Target and the holders of shares of Target capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

 (e)  Promptly after the effectiveness of the Form F-4, Target shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be published, sent or given to Targets shareholders, and if necessary, after the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus has been published, sent or given, promptly circulate amended, supplemented or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

 

 (f) Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement or any filing with the SEC incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, in each case prior to filing such with the SEC,  _except_ where doing so would cause the filing to not be filed timely, without regard to any extension pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Exchange Act;  _provided_ , _however_ , that each party shall be deemed to have consented to the inclusion in the Form F-4, the Proxy Statement or any filing with the SEC incorporated by reference in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement of any information, language or content specifically agreed to by such party or its counsel on or prior to the date hereof for inclusion therein.

  (g)  Parent will advise the Target promptly after it receives notice of (i) the time when the Form F-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, (ii) the issuance or threat of any stop order, (iii) the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Share issuable in connection with this Agreement for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or (iv) any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form F-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information (and shall deliver a copy of such comments and requests to the Target).

 

 (h)  Target will advise Parent, and Parent will advise Target, promptly after it receives notice of the issuance by the SEC, any Canadian Securities Regulatory Authority, as applicable, any other securities regulatory authority, the TSX, NYSE MKT or by any other competent authority of any order to cease or suspend trading of any securities of Target or Parent, as applicable, or of the institution or threat of institution of any proceedings for that purpose.

 

 (i) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Target or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Target or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement, including, where appropriate, a filing pursuant to Rules 165 and 425 of the Securities Act, describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of Target or Parent. 

 

 7.8 _Target Shareholders  Meeting_. Target shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receiving notice from Parent that the Form F-4 has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (i) take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Target duly to give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders to be held as promptly as practicable to consider the approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Target Meeting_ "); (ii) engage a proxy solicitation agent, which is approved by the Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), to advise on and assist with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Target Shareholder Approvals; (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the Target Shareholder Approvals and (iv) will take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote of its shareholders required by the rules of the NYSE MKT, the TSX or applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Target may adjourn or postpone the Target Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to its shareholders in advance of a vote on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, or, if as of the time for which the Target Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient Target Common Shares, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts such that the Target Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Target Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law, the rules of the NYSE MKT, the TSX and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Target. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Target shall not be required to hold the Target Meeting if this Agreement is terminated or if there is an Adverse Recommendation Change by Target before the Target Meeting is held. 

  7.9 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and upon exercise of the Substituted Options and the Assumed Warrants to be approved for listing on each of the NYSE MKT and the TSX at or prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance.

 

 7.10 _Notice of Certain Events_. Target shall give prompt notice to Parent of any fact, event or circumstance as to which Target obtains Knowledge that would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_  or _(b)_.

Prior to the Closing, Parent may deliver to Target a supplement or update to the Parent Disclosure Letter that reflects any event, condition or circumstance occurring or arising after the Agreement Date that is not otherwise prohibited pursuant to this Agreement and which, in the aggregate taking into account all supplemental disclosures (the " _Parent Supplemental Disclosures_ ") provided pursuant to this Section 7.10, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, in which case, prior to the Closing, the specified representations and warranties made by Parent will be deemed modified to reflect such event as of the date that such event occurs or arises for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 8.3 have been satisfied. 

 

 7.11 _Section 16_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Target shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Target Common Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of the Target who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Target.

 7.13 _Parent Shareholders  Meeting_. Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (i) take all steps reasonably necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a special (or annual and special) meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent Meeting_ ") for the purpose of securing the Parent Shareholders Approval, (ii) distribute to its shareholders a management information circular in accordance with applicable Law (the " _Parent MIC_ "), which Parent MIC shall contain the recommendation of the Parent board of directors that its shareholders approve this Agreement, (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and to secure the Parent Shareholders Approval and (iv) cooperate and consult with Target with respect to each of the foregoing matters.

Parent and Surviving Entity will assume and perform the obligations of Target under each indemnification agreement entered into between Target and the Indemnified Parties that is in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and will delivery on Closing the written agreement of Parent and Surviving Corporation to assume and perform such obligations. Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to reimburse all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by any Person to enforce the obligations of Parent and Surviving Entity under this Section 7.17.
