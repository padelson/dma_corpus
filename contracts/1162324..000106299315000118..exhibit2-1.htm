Parent Common Shares, on the basis of 0.255 of a Parent Common Share for each
one (1.0) Target Common Share (the &#147;<U>Exchange Ratio</U>&#148;). All such Target
Common Shares, when so converted, shall be retired, shall cease to be

the number of Parent Common Shares issuable therefor in accordance with the
Exchange Ratio, without interest, and any amounts payable pursuant to <U>Section
3.2(d)</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the Agreement Date and the
Effective Time, the Parent Common Shares or Target Common Shares are changed
into a different number of shares or a different class because of any stock
dividend or distribution, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Parent Common
Shares to be issued pursuant to this <U>Section 3.1(b)</U> shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such event. </P>

The shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into shares of common stock of

Surviving Entity and will be held by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. </P>

The Parent Common Shares issued upon the surrender or transfer of Target Common
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Target Common Shares
formerly represented by any physical certificate or statement of ownership in
book-entry form, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving

<I>Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund</I>. Parent shall authorize one or more
transfer agent(s) to act as exchange agent hereunder (the &#147;<U>Exchange
Agent</U>&#148;) with respect to the Merger. At and prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, as
depositary for the Parent Common Shares, or any successor depositary thereto, a
number of Parent Common Shares equal to the aggregate number of Parent Common
Shares to be issued in exchange for the Target Common Shares pursuant to the
Exchange Ratio (the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;). The Exchange Agent shall deliver
the applicable Parent Common Shares in exchange for the Target Common Shares
pursuant to <U>Section 3.1</U> out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated
by <U>Section 3.2(d)</U>, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%"

<I>Exchange Procedures</I>. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of Target
Common Shares a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Target Physical Shares shall pass, only
upon receipt of the Target Physical Shares by the Exchange Agent and shall be in
a form and have such other provisions as Parent and Target may reasonably
specify), and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Exchange Agent (which may include the receipt of an &#147;agents message&#148; by the
Exchange Agent in connection with Target Book-Entry Shares), for use in the
exchange contemplated by <U>Section 3.1</U> and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender or transfer of Target Common Shares for cancellation in
accordance with this Agreement (together, the &#147;<U>Exchange Instructions</U>&#148;).
Upon surrender or transfer of Target Common Shares for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and
duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the
Exchange Instructions, the holder of such Target Common Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor Parent Common Shares (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or as
otherwise agreed to by the Parent and Target) representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of Parent Common Shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to <U>Section 3.1</U> and <U>Section 3.2(i)</U>, plus any
amount payable pursuant to <U>Section 3.2(d)</U>. </P>

<I>Transferred Target Common Shares</I>. If any portion of the Parent Common
Shares are to be issued to a Person other than the registered holder of Target
Common Shares represented by the stock certificate(s) or statement of ownership
surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor, no such issuance shall be made
unless (i) the stock certificate(s) or statement of ownership so surrendered or
transferred have been properly endorsed and contain any required Medallion
Signature Guarantees and otherwise are in proper form for transfer, and (ii) the
Person requesting such issuance has paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other Taxes required as a result of such issuance to a Person other than the

such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. </P>

un-transferred Target Common Shares with respect to the Parent Common Shares
that such holder would be entitled to receive until surrender or transfer of
such Target Common Shares in accordance with <U>Sections 3.1 or 3.2(f)</U>.
Following surrender or transfer of any Target Common Shares, there shall be paid
to such holder of Parent Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) as soon as practicable after the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common Shares, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such Parent Common Shares. For purposes of dividends or other distributions
in respect of Parent Common Shares, all Parent Common Shares to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such Parent Common Shares were issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time. </P>

Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not exchanged such holder&#146;s Target Common Shares in accordance with this
Section 3.2 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Parent to
exchange such Target Common Shares pursuant to <U>Section 3.1</U> or
<U>3.2(i)</U> or to pay amounts to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.2(d) . Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any
holder of Target Common Shares for any such Parent Common Shares (or dividends

public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.</P>

Subject to applicable abandoned or unclaimed property laws, any certificates
formerly representing Target Common Shares that are not deposited with all other
documents as provided in <U>Section 3.2(b)</U> on or before the fifth
anniversary of the Effective Time shall cease to represent any right or claim of
any kind or nature and the right of the former shareholder of such Target Common

claiming such Target Physical Shares to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond,

<I>Withholding</I>. Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Target Common Shares such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent determine are
required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, such
withholding of Parent Common Shares issued to any holder of Target Common Shares
shall be an amount determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary to satisfy
the Parent&#146;s withholding obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Target Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be. Parent and Target shall cooperate with and assist each other
with efforts to reduce or eliminate such withholding Taxes. Parent will sell a
sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to satisfy the withholding obligation
and the balance of any Parent Common Shares and any cash proceeds remaining
after satisfaction of the withholding obligation shall be remitted to the
holder. </P>

Target Common Shares exchanged pursuant to this <U>Article III</U> (after taking
into account all Target Common Shares delivered or transferred by such holder)
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a number of Parent Common
Shares which is not a whole number shall receive the number of Parent Common
Shares rounded to the nearest whole number (and, if the fraction is 0.5, the
number of Parent Common Shares shall be rounded up to the next whole number).
The parties acknowledge that rounding of fractional Parent Common Shares was not
separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting problems
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent Common
Shares. </P>

Target&#146;s 2005 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, as amended (collectively, the

Effective Time into options (the &#147;<U>Substituted Options</U>&#148;) to purchase a
number of Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number of
Parent Common Shares) equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Target
Common Shares purchasable pursuant to such Target Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio at a price per Parent
Common Share equal to the exercise price per Target Common Share specified in
the Target Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio (such price rounded up to
the nearest whole cent). Such Substituted Option shall otherwise be subject to
the same terms and conditions, including vesting and expiry date, as the Target
Stock Option in respect of which it is issued. Parent will assume all
obligations under the Target Stock Option Plan as at the Effective Time and from
and after the Effective Time, and the Parent will comply with all of the terms
and conditions of the Substituted Options, including the obligation to issue the
Parent Common Shares contemplated thereby upon the exercise thereof. For
purposes of vesting conditions, the date of grant of the Substituted Option
shall be deemed to be the date on which the corresponding Target Stock Option
was granted. Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall make all necessary
amendments under the Target Stock Option Plan to provide that no further awards
shall be made thereunder following the Closing. At and after the Effective Time,
(i) all references in the Target Stock Option Plan and related stock option
agreements to Target shall be deemed to refer to Parent and (ii) Parent shall
assume all of Target&#146;s obligations with respect to the Target Stock Options as
so amended. Substitution of the Target Stock Options for the Substituted Options
will occur in compliance with Code Section 409A so that the substitution avoids
being treated as the grant of new stock options. </P>

contain appropriate provision such that the provisions of each Target Warrant
(including the exercise period and the exercise price and provision for
adjustment of the exercise price) shall thereafter be maintained in each such
Assumed Warrant as nearly equivalent as may be practicable in relation to such
Target Warrant. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall comply with all

requirements of NI 43-101. To Parent&#146;s Knowledge, the estimates of mineral
reserves and resources reflected in the Target 43-101 Technical Reports were
estimated in good faith using methods and based on assumptions considered
reasonable at the time of estimation on the basis of drill and test data
generated and compiled in accordance with prudent mining and engineering
practice. The mine plans of Parent listed in Section 5.16 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, including the financial forecasts and budgets included
therein and the studies related thereto (i) have been prepared by management of
Parent in good faith and in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) are based
on assumptions, including assumptions relating to mining operations, capital and
operating costs and production rates, that are considered by management to be
reasonable, as at the date the mine plans were prepared, for the purpose of
planning the future mining operations of Parent, provided that Target
acknowledges that Parent provides no assurance as to the future uranium prices
used in such mine plans, other than where the uranium prices reflect contractual
prices for uranium to be delivered under existing supply agreements.<B> </B></P>

as set forth in Section 5.17 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, each Material
Contract is valid and binding and in full force and effect and Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be performed by
them under each Material Contract in all material respects. To Parent&#146;s
Knowledge, there does not exist, nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
received written notice of, any material breach of or violation or default

neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of the
desire of the other party or parties to any such contract to exercise any rights
such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise

Parent or Target, as applicable, its costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146;
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the payment at a rate of 10% per annum. For greater certainty, each of
Target and Parent agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where Target or Parent is entitled to a Termination Fee and such
Termination Fee is paid in full, Target or Parent, as the case may be, shall be
precluded from any other remedy against the other party at Law or in equity or
otherwise (including, without limitation, an order for specific performance),
and shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the other party
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their
respective representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided, however, that payment by a party of a Termination
Fee shall not be in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy available
(including, without limitation, an order for specific performance) in the event
of any wilful or intentional breach by such party of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. </P>
