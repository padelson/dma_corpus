 STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of November 11,
2020, is made by and among Utz Quality Foods, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Purchaser1"), Heron Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Purchaser2" and together with Purchaser1, "Purchasers" and
individually, a "Purchaser"), Truco Holdco Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), Truco Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Seller"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings set forth in Article IX.

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
of the Company (collectively, the "Shares");

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, there are outstanding options to acquire
2,188,391.45 shares of common stock of the Company (less any options to
acquire shares of common stock of the Company that are cancelled, forfeited,
terminated, repurchased or otherwise cease to be outstanding for any reason on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing in accordance with their
respective terms, the "Options"); and

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing
(a) Purchaser1 desires to purchase from OTB Acquisition LLC ("OTBA") all of
the Acquired Assets (as defined in the IP APA) pursuant to the IP APA, (b)
Purchaser2 desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to
Purchaser2, all of the Shares and (c) Purchasers, the Company and Seller
desire to cause the Options that are outstanding at the Closing to be
terminated in exchange for the consideration set forth in this Agreement to
the extent vested.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree as follows:

Article I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES



1.01 Purchase and Sale of Shares; Termination of the Options.

(a) Purchase and Sale of Shares. At the Closing, immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the IP APA, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser2, and Purchaser2 shall purchase and
acquire from Seller, all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other
than Liens arising under applicable securities Laws), for and in consideration
of the Closing Date Share Consideration.

(b) Estimated Purchase Price. The "Estimated Purchase Price" means (i)
$480,000,000 (the "Base Value"), plus (ii) the amount, if any, by which
Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds Target Working Capital, minus (iii) the
amount, if any, by which Target Working Capital exceeds Estimated Net Working
Capital, plus (iv) the Estimated Cash on Hand, minus (v) the Estimated
Indebtedness, minus (vi) the Estimated Transaction Expenses, minus (vii) the
IP Purchase Price.

(c) Termination and Cash-Out of the Options. Prior to the Closing, the
Company\'s board of directors shall take all actions necessary to terminate
all Options effective immediately prior to the Closing in consideration for payment to the holders
of such Options that are vested Options (the "Optionholders") of the
applicable portion of the Option Consideration and for unvested Options, the
termination of such Options without any payment. Promptly, and in any event
within three business days after the Closing Date, Purchaser2 shall cause
Truco Enterprises to pay to each Optionholder (through the payroll system of
Truco Enterprises) an amount in cash equal to (i) the product of (A) the Per
Share Estimated Purchase Price and (B) the number of shares of common stock of
the Company then purchasable upon exercise of all vested Options owned by such
Optionholder immediately prior to the Closing, less (ii) the aggregate dollar
amount that would be received by the Company in respect of the exercise price
upon the full exercise (and not any net exercise) by such Optionholder of all
vested Options owned by such Optionholder outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing (with respect to an Optionholder, such Optionholder\'s "Optionholder
Payment Amount" and the aggregate of all Optionholder Payment Amounts, the
"Option Consideration"), less all applicable withholding Taxes.

1.02 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place by conference call and electronic
(i.e., email/".pdf") correspondence on the first business day following full
satisfaction or valid waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in
Article II (other than those closing conditions set forth in Article II that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing) or on such other date as is
mutually agreed to in writing by Purchaser1 and Seller; provided that in no
event shall Purchasers be required to consummate the Closing prior to December
21, 2020. The date and time of the Closing are referred to herein as the
"Closing Date."

1.04 Purchase Price Adjustments

. (a) By not later than the end of the fourth business day prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchasers a statement (the "Pre-Closing
Statement") setting forth the Fully Diluted Shares, the IP Purchase Price and
Seller\'s good faith estimates of Net Working Capital ("Estimated Net Working
Capital"), Cash on Hand ("Estimated Cash on Hand"), Indebtedness ("Estimated
Indebtedness") and Transaction Expenses ("Estimated Transaction Expenses") and
the resulting calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price, and a schedule (the
"Option Consideration Schedule") setting forth for each Optionholder the
number of shares of common stock of the Company subject to vested Options held
by such Optionholder immediately prior to the Closing and the dollar amount of
such Optionholder\'s Optionholder Payment Amount and the Option Consideration.
The Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions
set forth in this Agreement, including the definition of Net Working Capital,
and, where applicable, the Applicable Accounting Principles. Seller shall give
Purchasers and their accountants' reasonable access to review the books,
records and work papers (subject to the execution of customary work paper
access letters if requested) of the Company Entities used in the preparation
of the Pre-Closing Statement. Purchasers and their accountants may make
inquiries of Seller and the Company Entities and their accountants regarding
the Pre-Closing Statement and Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause
the other Company Entities to, use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective employees and accountants to reasonably cooperate with, and
respond to, such inquiries. Seller shall consider in good faith any comments
to the Pre-Closing Statement made by Purchasers in good faith in writing and
delivered to Seller not later than the end of the second business day prior to
the Closing Date. If Estimated Net Working Capital set forth in the Pre-
Closing Statement is greater than $13,000,000, then the Estimated Purchase
Price, the Optionholder Payment Amounts and the Option Consideration shall be
calculated as if Estimated Net Working Capital was equal to $13,000,000.

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser1 will deliver to Seller a
statement setting forth Purchasers\' good faith calculation of Net Working
Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and the resulting
Final Purchase Price (the "Preliminary Closing Statement"). The Preliminary
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions set
forth in this Agreement, including the definition of Net Working Capital, and,
where applicable, the Applicable Accounting Principles. After delivery of the
Preliminary Closing Statement, Purchasers shall give Seller and its
accountants reasonable access to review the books, records and work papers
(subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested)
of the Company Entities, Purchasers (solely to the extent used in the
preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement) and their accountants used
in the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement. Seller and its
accountants may make inquiries of the Company Entities, Purchasers (solely to
the extent related to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement)
and their accountants regarding the Preliminary Closing Statement and
Purchasers and the Company shall, and shall cause the other Company Entities
to, use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective employees and
accountants to reasonably cooperate with, and respond to, such inquiries. If
Seller has any objections to the Preliminary Closing Statement, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser1 a statement setting forth such objections, including
setting forth in reasonable detail based on the information that has been made
available to Seller by Purchasers pursuant to Seller's request the particulars
of each objection (including for each component of the calculations objected
to, the amount of Seller\'s calculation of such component and reasons for the
difference) (an "Objections Statement") within 45 days after Seller\'s receipt
of the Preliminary Closing Statement. Any items contained in the Preliminary
Closing Statement not objected to in the Objections Statement will be deemed
to have been accepted by Seller. If an Objections Statement is not delivered
to Purchaser1 within 45 days after Seller\'s receipt of the Preliminary
Closing Statement, the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be final, binding
and non-appealable by the parties hereto. If an Objections Statement is
delivered to Purchaser1 within 45 days after Seller\'s receipt of the Preliminary Closing
Statement, Seller and Purchaser1 shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
objections set forth in the Objections Statement and if they do not reach a
final resolution of all such objections within 30 days after Seller\'s
delivery of the Objections Statement to Purchaser1, Seller and Purchaser1
shall submit any objections for which final resolution between Seller and
Purchaser1 has not been reached in writing ("Disputed Items") to Grant
Thornton or such other dispute resolution firm mutually acceptable to Seller
and Purchaser1 (the "Dispute Resolution Firm"). The Dispute Resolution Firm\'s
determination will be based solely on the definitions of Net Working Capital,
Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses set forth in this
Agreement, including, where applicable, the definition of Applicable
Accounting Principles, and the written submissions of Seller and Purchaser1
(i.e., not on the basis of an independent review or investigation). Purchaser1
and Seller shall promptly provide their written submissions regarding the
Disputed Items in writing to the Dispute Resolution Firm and to each other.
The Dispute Resolution Firm shall be instructed to render its determination
with respect to the Disputed Items as soon as reasonably possible (which the
parties agree should not be later than 45 days following the date on which the
disagreement is referred to the Dispute Resolution Firm), and to send copies
of such written determination to Purchaser1 and Seller. No hearing shall be
held and no discovery shall be permitted. No party shall engage, directly or
indirectly, in ex parte communications with the Dispute Resolution Firm. The
Dispute Resolution Firm shall not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater
than the greatest value for such item submitted by either party to the Dispute
Resolution Firm or less than the smallest value for such item submitted by
either party to the Dispute Resolution Firm. The Dispute Resolution Firm may
not award the parties in the aggregate more than the amount in dispute. The
decision of the Dispute Resolution Firm with respect to all Disputed Items
shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The costs
and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be paid by Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchasers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the Disputed Items not awarded to each party bears to the
aggregate amount of Disputed Items. For example, if Seller submits an
Objections Statement for $1,000, and if Purchaser1 disputes only $500 of the
amount claimed by Seller which the parties cannot mutually resolve, and if the
Dispute Resolution Firm ultimately resolves the Disputed Items by awarding
Seller $300 of the $500 of Disputed Items, then the costs and expenses of the
Dispute Resolution Firm will be paid 60% (i.e. 300/500) by Purchasers and 40%
(i.e., 200/500) by Seller.

(c) The "Final Purchase Price" means (i) the Base Value, plus (ii) the amount,
if any, by which Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.04(b) exceeds Target Working Capital, minus (iii) the amount, if any, by
which Target Working Capital exceeds Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.04(b), plus (iv) the Cash on Hand as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.04(b), minus (v) the Indebtedness as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.04(b), minus (vi) the Transaction Expenses as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.04(b), minus (vii) the IP Purchase Price.

(d) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price
(the amount of such excess, the "Upward Amount"):

(i) Purchaser2 shall promptly (but in any event within five business days
after the determination of the Final Purchase Price) deliver or cause to be
delivered to Seller the Upward Amount, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by Seller; and

(ii) Purchaser2 and Seller shall promptly (but in any event within five
business days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price) instruct
the Escrow Agent to release the entirety of the Adjustment Escrow Amount to Seller, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
Seller.

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the
amount of such shortfall, the "Downward Amount") and the Downward Amount is
less than or equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Purchaser2 and Seller
shall promptly (but in any event within five business days after the
determination of the Final Purchase Price) instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
(i) to Purchaser2, from the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the lesser of (x) the
Downward Amount and (y) the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) the balance of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any, to Seller, in each case by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated by Purchaser2 or
Seller, as applicable.

(f) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price and
the Downward Amount is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, (x)
Purchaser2 and Seller shall promptly (but in any event within five business
days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price) instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to Purchaser2 the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount and (y) Seller
shall pay promptly (but in any event within five business days after the
determination of the Final Purchase Price) to Purchaser2 the amount by which
the Downward Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, in each case by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
Purchaser2.

(g) Until the earlier of the determination of the Final Purchase Price (i)
that results in an Upward Amount or a Downward Amount that is less than or
equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount, or (ii) that results in a Downward
Amount greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount and Seller pays in full such
amount to Purchaser2, Seller shall retain in liquid assets and not distribute
to its equityholders at least $2,000,000. Such funds shall serve as a source
for funding any payment obligation of Seller pursuant to Section 1.04(f).

1.05 Withholding Rights

. Purchasers or their designees and the Company Entities shall be entitled to
withhold and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as such Person is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law; provided that if Purchasers determine that an
amount payable pursuant to this Agreement is required to be deducted and
withheld (except for payments to Optionholders), at least two business days
prior to the date the applicable payment is scheduled to be made, Purchaser2
shall provide Seller with written notice of the intent to deduct and withhold,
which shall include the amount to be deducted and withheld and any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law pursuant to which such deduction
and withholding is required and provide the recipient of such payment the
opportunity during such two business day period for such recipient to provide
forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

include any predecessor of such Company Entity or any Person which merged or

3.09 Real Property.

(a) No Company Entity owns any real property. Schedule 3.09(a) contains a
correct and complete list of all real property leased (whether as landlord or
tenant) or occupied by any Company Entity and the lessor and lessee of such
property (the "Leased Real Property"). The applicable Company Entity has a
valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property.

threatened or contemplated. There are no pending or threatened changes to any
applicable codes or zoning requirements affecting or against all or any
portion of the Leased Real Property. There are no (i) public improvements
which have been ordered, commenced or completed and for which an assessment
may be levied against the Leased Real Property, or (ii) planned improvements
which may result in any assessment against the Leased Real Property. There is
no Lien applicable to the Leased Real Property that would reasonably be
expected to impair in any material respect the current use or occupancy of
such Leased Real Property by any Company Entity. All buildings, structures,
fixtures and appurtenances comprising part of the Leased Real Property were
constructed or installed in compliance in all material respects with all Laws,
are structurally sound, are in good condition and repair (normal wear and tear
excepted), and do not encroach on any property owned by any other Person.
There are no material violations of any Law affecting any portion of the

written notice of any such violation has been issued by any Governmental
Authority and received by any Company Entity. (c) To Seller\'s Knowledge, all improvements to the Leased Real Property
(including mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems serving such
improvements) are in good condition and repair (normal wear and tear excepted)
and such improvements are free from structural defects. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.09(c), no Company Entity has any continuing maintenance, repair or
capital improvement obligations with respect to the Leased Real Property.
There are no improvements or additions that are required to be removed by the
lessee upon termination of any lease or sublease relating to the Leased Real
Property and there are no damages, conditions or repairs that the lessee would

sublease. The Leased Real Property is supplied with utilities and other
services adequate for the operation of such Leased Real Property, including
adequate water, storm and sanitary sewer, gas, electric, cable and telephone
facilities. The Company Entities have obtained all agreements or other rights
from any other Person necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of the
facilities located on the Leased Real Property or any driveways, roads and
other means of egress and ingress to and from the Leased Real Property, and
each such agreement or other right is in full force and effect. There is no
pending or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, threatened Legal Proceeding which could
result in the modification or cancellation of such agreements or rights.

(d) There are no outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first
refusal held by any Company Entity to purchase the Leased Real Property or any
portion thereof or interest therein. The Leased Real Property is not shared by
any Company Entity, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other hand,
or used for any business other than the Company Entities' business. The
applicable Company Entity has the right to quiet enjoyment of the Leased Real
Property. Since the Lookback Date, there has been no disturbance of, or
challenge to, any Company Entity\'s quiet possession of any Leased Real
Property.

(e) There is no pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened Legal Proceeding
against or affecting the Leased Real Property.

any Governmental Authorities to be imposed, assessed or levied against the
Leased Real Property. Any impact fees imposed, assessed or levied upon the
Leased Real Property have been paid in full.

(ii) pending applications for registration of any Company-Owned Intellectual
Property Rights, (iii) Contracts under which any Company Entity has granted or
licensed to any third party any Intellectual Property Rights and/or Company

Software, (vi) material trade secrets (but only a high-level non-confidential
description thereof), (vii) material unregistered Marks, and (viii) Domain
Names, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (v) - (viii), owned or
purported to be owned by (or, with respect to Domain Names, registered in the

(other than (A) applications listed in Schedule 3.11(a)(ii) and (B) the
Registered Company Intellectual Property listed in Schedule 3.11(a)(ix) that
the Company Entities do not intend to pursue or maintain (this clause (B),
"Non-Active IP")) are valid, subsisting and enforceable. None of the Company-
Owned Intellectual Property Rights (other than Non-Active IP), nor to
Seller\'s Knowledge any other material Company Intellectual Property Rights,
have expired or been cancelled, abandoned, or otherwise terminated and no act
or omission has occurred or is occurring that would reasonably be expected to
result in or cause the abandonment, cancellation, loss, lapse, or expiration
of any such Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights or, to Seller\'s
Knowledge, the other material Company Intellectual Property Rights. All
required filings and fees related to the Registered Company Intellectual
Property (other than the Non-Active IP) have been timely submitted and paid to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities. All Registered Company Intellectual
Property (other than the Non-Active IP) has been duly filed, registered or
issued, as the case may be, with the appropriate Governmental Authorities and
have been properly maintained and renewed in accordance with all applicable
Laws in all material respects.

(b) No Company-Owned Intellectual Property Right nor, to Seller\'s Knowledge,
any other Company Intellectual Property Right, is subject to any outstanding
order of any Governmental Authority, and, except as set forth on Schedule
3.11(b), no Company-Owned Intellectual Property Right is subject to any
Contract restricting the use thereof by any Company Entity or restricting the
licensing thereof by any Company Entity to any Person, in each case, in any
material respect.

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(c), the Company Entities own,
exclusively and beneficially, free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens), all rights, title, and interests in and to the Company-Owned
Intellectual Property Rights, and have the valid right to use, free and clear
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), all of the other Company
Intellectual Property Rights, and no Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights are in the
control of any Person other than the Company Entities. The Company
Intellectual Property Rights comprise all of the Intellectual Property Rights
necessary for the operation of the Company Entities\' business (including the
manufacture, advertising, marketing, promotion, offering for sale, sale, and
distribution of Products) in the manner operated in the prior 12 months.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(c), no Company-Owned Intellectual
Property Right is subject to any action, Contract, or outstanding order or
settlement agreement or stipulation that restricts in any material manner the
use, provision, transfer, assignment or licensing thereof by any Company
Entity (or, after the consummation of the transactions, Purchasers) or
materially affects the validity, use or enforceability of such Company-Owned
Intellectual Property Right.

(d) The operation of the Company Entities\' business, as currently conducted
by the Company Entities and as conducted since the Lookback Date, and the
Company Intellectual Property Rights as used by the Company Entities since the
Lookback Date have not, infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise
violated, and do not infringe, dilute, misappropriate, or otherwise violate,
the Intellectual Property Rights or other rights of any Person or give rise to
an obligation to render an accounting to any Person as a result of co-
authorship or co-invention.

(e) Since the Lookback Date, (i) neither Seller nor any Company Entity has
received any written notice (including by demand letter or offer to license)
alleging that the operation of the Company Entities\' business infringes,
and/or its use of any Intellectual Property Rights misappropriates or
otherwise violates, the Intellectual Property Rights or any other right of any
Person and (ii) except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(e)(ii), to Seller\'s
Knowledge, no Person has infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated any
Company Intellectual Property Right. There is no reasonable basis for any
Legal Proceeding asserting any such infringement or asserting that any Company
Entity does not have the legal right to use any of the Company Intellectual
Property Rights or that any Company Entity unfairly competes with any Person.

(f) All material Software used in connection with Company Entities\' business
or otherwise residing on the computer systems of the Company Entities is
properly licensed, and no Company Entity has made any unlicensed copies of
such Software except those permitted for archival and back-up purposes as
permitted by applicable Law. No Company Entity nor, to Seller\'s Knowledge,
any other party, is, in any material respect, in breach of or in default under
any license or other Contract relating to such Software, and each such license
and other Contract is valid and in full force and effect. The Company Entities
own all licenses necessary to use the Software used in the operation of their
business and the Company Entities are in material compliance with all such
licenses and are not violating the rights of the owner of such Software in any
material respect. Except as would not result in material Liability to the
Company Entities, no event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute an event of default under any such
license or result in a termination thereof or would cause or permit the
acceleration or other changes of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit thereunder.

(g) The applicable Company Entity has the right to use, sell, license, dispose
of, sublicense, and freely assign, and has the right to bring actions for the
infringement or misappropriation of, any of the Company-Owned Intellectual
Property Rights. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(g), no Company Entity is
under any obligation (i) to pay any royalty, license fee, or other similar
consideration to any Person other than license fees or other similar
consideration for commercially available Software that are generally available
on nondiscriminatory pricing terms which have an aggregate annual cost of $150,000 or less, or (ii) to obtain any
approval or consent for use of any of the Intellectual Property Rights used in
or necessary for the conduct of their business.

(h) Except as would not result in a material Liability to the Company
Entities, any Software created or developed by any Company Entity or on its
behalf, including any Software comprising the Company-Owned Intellectual
Property Rights, is and, to Seller\'s Knowledge, all other Software comprising
the Company Intellectual Property Rights is, free and clear of any defects,
malware, viruses, or other malicious code. The Software comprising the
Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights is free from any open source
software code and the use, sale, distribution, or licensing of any such
Software is not governed, in whole or in part, by the terms of any open source
software license including the GNU General Public License, in each case, that
is incorporated in a manner that requires (as a license condition or
otherwise) any Company Entity to disclose, assign, or license any source code
or any other Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights.

(i) Each current and former employee of any Company Entity and any current or
former independent contractor or other Person retained by any Company Entity
who, either alone or in concert with others, created or creates, developed or
develops, invented or invents, discovered or discovers, derived or derives,
programmed or programs, or designed or designs any of the material Company-
Owned Intellectual Property Rights, has entered into a written agreement with
the applicable Company Entity (i) presently assigning all rights in such
Intellectual Property Rights to such Company Entity (or such Company-Owned
Intellectual Property Rights has vested in such Company Entity by operation of
Law), and (ii) to the extent applicable to such Company-Owned Intellectual
Property Rights, providing that such employee, independent contractor, or
other Person waives any moral rights thereto. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.11(i), each current and former employee of any Company Entity and any
current or former independent contractor or other Person retained by any
Company Entity who has had access to or was provided with any material
confidential information or trade secrets of any Company Entity or any
confidential information for which any Company Entity owed or owes a duty of
confidentiality to a third Person, has entered into a written agreement with
the applicable Company Entity containing reasonable confidentiality
obligations to protect such confidential information or trade secrets and that
are compliant in all material respects with any obligations of confidentiality
owed by such Company Entity to any applicable third Person. No former owner,
Affiliate, employee, or independent contractor of the Company, or other
Person, has any valid claim or right to any of the rights in the material
Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights. Each Company Entity has used and
uses its reasonable efforts to diligently protect its rights in the material
Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights, including the confidential nature
of all trade secrets (including any trade secrets of third parties to whom
such Company Entity owed or owes a duty of confidentiality), and there have
been no acts or omissions by any Company Entity, the result of which would be
to compromise the rights of any Company Entity in any material respect (or
Purchasers after the Closing Date) to apply for or enforce appropriate legal
protection afforded by such Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights in the
manner in which the Company Entities\' business is currently operated or that
would result in the abandonment, dedication to the public domain, or loss of
any rights in or to any such Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights. The
Company Entities have not and have not been in violation of any
confidentiality obligation owed to any other Person in any material respect.

(j) The Company Entities own or have exclusive control over all Domain Names
comprising the Company-Owned Intellectual Property Rights (including all login
or access credentials for any social media accounts and Domain Name
registrations) and no single employee, contractor or other Person owns,
maintains, or controls such login or access credentials. (k) Except as would not result in a material Liability to the Company
Entities, the Company Entities have all consents, authorizations, permissions,
and/or waivers necessary to use any names, images, likenesses, quotes, or
other personal indicia of any Person as so used by the Company Entities, and
such consents, authorizations, permissions shall survive the Closing.

3.12 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12, no Company Entity is
(and has not been since the Lookback Date) a claimant or defendant in, or
otherwise a party to, any Legal Proceeding or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, any
Legal Proceeding threatened against any Company Entity or otherwise affecting
or involving the business or the assets of any Company Entity. There is, to
Seller\'s Knowledge, no investigation or review pending or threatened by any
Governmental Authority with respect to any Company Entity or their business.
There are no orders of any Governmental Authority in force against any Company
Entity or under which any Company Entity is subject to ongoing obligations.

reasonably could be expected to have any material Liability with respect to or
on account of any member of the Controlled Group) a "defined benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a pension plan subject to the funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or a
Multiemployer Plan. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not a
transaction described in Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan and, to Seller\'s Knowledge, each PEO Plan that

compliance with its terms and in material compliance with all applicable Laws,

1996. The Company Entities have in all material respects made full and timely
payment of all contributions required to be made to any Employee Benefit Plan
or PEO Plan by the terms of such plan or under applicable Law. There have been
no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on
"fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with
respect to the Employee Benefit Plans or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, the PEO
Plans, in each case, that would result in any material Liability or material
excise Tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on any Company Entity.

(e) With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan and, to Seller\'s Knowledge,
with respect to any PEO Plan, there is no pending or, to Seller\'s Knowledge,

subject of an audit or examination of a Governmental Authority.

(f) None of the Employee Benefit Plans or PEO Plans in which Business
Employees or former employees of any Company Entity participate provide

Section 409A of the Code.

(i) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (either alone or in combination with another event) by any
Business Employee or officer, director or manager of any Company Entity who is
a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination agreement or
other compensation arrangement of any Company Entity or Employee Benefit Plan
currently in effect would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment"
(as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), without regard to
whether such compensation is considered to be reasonable compensation for
services rendered and without regard to any arrangement entered into by
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates with a "disqualified
individual" in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(j) No Company Entity is under any obligation (express or implied) to modify

Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would
result, individually or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess

other than pursuant to the expiration of a term in accordance with the terms
thereof, has been received by Seller or any Company Entity with respect to any Insurance Policy, and, to Seller\'s Knowledge, no event or condition
exists or has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in
cancellation of any Insurance Policy prior to its scheduled expiration date.

respects by the Company Entities with all requirements of applicable Law and
with the requirements of all Material Contracts and other material Contracts
to which any Company Entity is a party. Since the Lookback Date, no Company
Entity has been refused any insurance with respect to its business or assets.
No Insurance Policy provides for or is subject to any retroactive rate or
premium adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other Liability arising wholly
or partially out of events arising prior to the Closing. Neither Seller nor
any Company Entity has received any written notice from or on behalf of any
insurance carrier issuing any Insurance Policy that insurance rates therefor

to any Company Entity, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018; the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended and

"Privacy Commitments"). "Processing" means any operation performed on Personal
Information, including the collection, creation, receipt, access, use,
handling, compilation, analysis, monitoring, maintenance, retention, storage,
transmission, transfer, protection, disclosure, distribution, destruction, or
disposal of Personal Information. "Privacy Policies" means, collectively, each
Company Entity\'s past (but only since the Lookback Date) or present,
employee-facing or public-facing policies or other generally distributed
employee-facing or public-facing statements or disclosures concerning the
privacy, security, or Processing of Personal Information. Schedule 3.20(a)
contains a listing of Company's Privacy Policies since the Lookback Date, and
the period of time during which each such Privacy Policy was or has been in
effect since the Lookback Date. Except as would not result in a material
Liability to the Company Entities, the use by any Company Entity of its
databases or data or other information relating to its customers, end users or
data subjects after the Closing in the same manner in which they are currently
used by any Company Entity will not cause, constitute, or result in a breach
or violation of any Privacy Laws or Privacy Commitments, or any Contracts to
which any Company Entity is a party (including the terms of service entered
into by users of the Company Entities\' websites), or require the consent of
or notice to any individual concerning such individual\'s Personal
Information, in each case, in any material respect. Since the Lookback Date,
no disclosure or representation contained in any Privacy Policy has been
inaccurate, misleading or deceptive in a manner that constitutes a violation
of any Privacy Laws or any third-party right in any material respect. There
are no unsatisfied access, right-to-know, or similar requests in respect of
Personal Information held by the Company Entities, or any outstanding
applications for rectification, transfer, deletion, or erasure of Personal
Information, in each case, that a failure to satisfy would constitute a
violation of any Privacy Laws in any material respect. To Seller\'s Knowledge,
any vendor, processor, or other third party Processing Personal Information

and since the Lookback Date have been, in compliance in all material respects
with the Privacy Commitments and applicable Privacy Policies in all material
respects. Each Company Entity has since the Lookback Date taken commercially
reasonable measures (including adherence to a vendor management program under
which each Company Entity (1) exercises appropriate due diligence before it
enters into a relationship with a Subprocessor, and (2) exercises reasonable,
ongoing oversight after a Subprocessor relationship is established

has complied with in all material respects its contractual obligations to such
Company Entity concerning the privacy, security, and Processing of Personal
Information.

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20(b), since the Lookback Date, no
Person has gained unauthorized access to or engaged in unauthorized Processing
of, nor has there been any unauthorized disclosure of, (i) any Personal
Information held by any Company Entity or any other Person on any Company
Entity\'s behalf; (ii) Personal Information on any databases, computers,
servers, storage media (e.g., backup tapes), network devices, or other devices
or systems that Processes Personal Information owned or maintained by any
Company Entity or any other Persons on the behalf of any Company Entity, in
each case, other than incidental unauthorized access to Personal Information
by, or incidental unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information to, a
Company Entity employee or contractor that did not have authority to access or
receive such Personal Information, and where, if discovered by a Company
Entity, such unauthorized access or disclosure was promptly addressed by the
relevant Company Entity in its reasonable business judgment ((i) and (ii)
collectively, a "Security Breach"). Each Company Entity has since the Lookback
Date used commercially reasonable controls, technologies, processes and practices
(including use of a Vendor Management Program) to detect, identify and
remediate Security Breaches and provide notification in accordance with
applicable Privacy Laws in the case of a Security Breach. No circumstance has
arisen since the Lookback Date in which applicable Privacy Laws would require
any Company Entity to notify a Governmental Authority or other Person of a
Security Breach, and no Company Entity has received from any Governmental
Authority or other Person any written or e-mail complaint, claim,
investigation, notice, subpoena or other evidence of noncompliance with such
Privacy Laws and/or related to any actual, alleged, or suspected Security
Breach, and to Seller\'s Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any of the foregoing.

(c) Except as would not result in a material Liability to the Company
Entities, and except as set forth on Schedule 3.20(c)(2), the Company Entities
have commercially reasonable disaster recovery and security plans and
procedures, including a written information security program, that contain
commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards,
designed to protect the continuity, confidentiality, availability, and
integrity of the Company Entities\' business, Personal Information, and the
computer systems, networks and servers of the Company Entities from failure,
unauthorized use, access or other Processing, and each Company Entity is in
compliance in all material respects with such plans and procedures. Except as
would not result in a material Liability to the Company Entities, the Company
Entities have security plans that are reasonably designed to (i) identify
internal and external risks to the security of any proprietary and
confidential information of each Company Entity and any Personal Information
held or used by each Company Entity, and (ii) implement, monitor and improve
safeguards to control those risks. Since the Lookback Date, there have been no
actual breaches of the security of the computer systems, networks or servers
of any Company Entity or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, of any Subprocessor, that
resulted in unauthorized access to, or any loss or unauthorized disclosure of,
Personal Information or, except as set forth on Schedule 3.20(c)(1), any
proprietary or confidential information of any Company Entity in the
possession, custody, or control of any Company Entity or any of their
respective employees, or Subprocessors, and, to Seller\'s Knowledge, there is
no reason to expect that such a breach or any other unauthorized use, access,
disclosure, or other unauthorized Processing of any Personal Information or
any proprietary and confidential information of any Company Entity has
occurred. Except as would not result in material Liability to the Company
Entities, since the Lookback Date, the Company Entities have quarterly
performed a security risk assessment and, except as set forth on Schedule
3.20(c)(3), a privacy impact assessment, and, except as set forth on Schedule
3.20(c)(4), each Company Entity has addressed and remediated in all material
respects all critical, high and medium severity threats or deficiencies (as
defined by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System v.3.0) identified in each
such assessment. The computer hardware, servers, networks, and other
information technology equipment or systems owned or used by the Company
Entities are reasonably sufficient for operation of their business as
currently conducted. Since the Lookback Date, there has been no material
disruption of the hardware, servers, networks, and other information
technology equipment or systems owned or used by the Company Entities that has
not been remediated in all material respects.

(d) Each Company Entity has complied in all material respects with all terms
of use, terms of service, and other Contracts, guidelines, and policies
relating to its use of social media platforms (if any), sites, or services and
there is no reasonable basis to believe that any Company Entity is in
violation in any material respect of any such terms of use, terms of service,
Contracts, guidelines, and/or policies. 3.21 Inventory. Subject to the applicable reserves for inventory write down
reflected in Net Working Capital, all inventory of the Company Entities: (a)
consists of new and unused items of a quality, quantity and condition, (b) is

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The quantities of
each of the categories of inventory (raw materials, work in process and

the continuation of the Company Entities\' business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice. No Company Entity is in possession of any
inventory not owned by a Company Entity, including goods already sold. None of
the inventory of the Company Entities has been consigned to any Person.

3.22 Accounts Receivable. The accounts receivable of the Company Entities
represent valid obligations that arose from bona fide transactions in the
ordinary course of business. Subject to the applicable reserves for doubtful
accounts reflected in Net Working Capital, none of such accounts receivable is
subject to any claim of offset or recoupment or counterclaim, and to Seller\'s
Knowledge, there are no specific facts that would be likely to give rise to
any such claim. The reserves against accounts receivable shown on the
Financial Statements are adequate in all material respects and were calculated
consistent with past practice.

a list of the Material Customers and Material Suppliers. Since January 1,

Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with,

reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in obtaining, or increase the
risk of not obtaining, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an order prohibiting or delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) delay the consummation of the

shall be required to furnish to Purchasers or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives or provide Purchasers or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives with access to information if such access (y) would result in
the waiver or forfeiture of any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or similar privilege or (z) would be in violation of applicable Laws
(including any Law related to COVID-19) or the provisions of any Contract to
which any Company Entity is a party; provided that Seller and the Company will
inform Purchasers of the general nature of the document or information being
withheld and reasonably cooperate with Purchasers to provide such document or

6.06 Code Section 280G. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (a) waivers of any payments and/or benefits
to "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)
of the Company Entities that, separately or in the aggregate, may constitute
"parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and
the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder ("Section 280G
Payments") from, and duly executed by, such "disqualified individuals" and (b)
thereafter, if such waivers are in fact obtained, approval (meeting the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the applicable rulings
and final regulations thereunder) of such Section 280G Payments, such that no
such payment will be deemed an "excess parachute payment" as contemplated by
Section 280G of the Code and the applicable rulings and final regulations

Purchasers that could be deemed parachute payments with respect to any
disqualified individuals of the Company Entities ("New Arrangements"),
Purchasers shall deliver to the Company all relevant information with respect
to such New Arrangements at least five business days prior to the Closing

Company Entity that he or she will reduce his or her role or scope of duties
with any Company Entity.

6.08 Financing Cooperation.

of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause the other Company
Entities and their respective officers, directors, principals, managers and
employees to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the following
assistance and cooperation in connection with the financing contemplated by
the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from the

commitment to provide financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or such other commitment letter, the "Financing"):

reasonably requested by Purchasers;

(iii) furnishing Purchasers with customary financial information of the
Company Entities as may be reasonably requested by either Purchaser or the
Financing Sources in connection with the Financing, including financial

assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to be made are the
responsibility of Purchasers), and reasonable and customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information about the Company Entities to prospective lenders
and containing customary information and confidentiality provisions;

documentation for the Financing;

(v) (w) cooperating with Financing Sources due diligence investigation and

consummation of the Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any Permanent Financing (as defined in the Debt Commitment
Letter)), and (z) obtaining customary accountants\' comfort letters and audit
reports as reasonably requested by Purchasers; and

(vi) at least seven (7) business days prior to the Closing Date, providing all

definitive documents in respect of the Financing, except, in the case of the
Company Entities, to the extent effective after the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this Section 6.08 shall
require any such cooperation or assistance to the extent that it would
reasonably be expected to result in any Company Entity being required to (I)

any actions to the extent such actions would, in the Company\'s reasonable

(IV) commit to take any action under any certificate, document or instrument
that is not contingent upon the Closing, (V) provide access to, or disclose,
information that the Company reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of, or conflict with any
confidentiality requirements applicable to, the Company Entities or their
Affiliates or (VI) cause any director, manager, officer or equivalent of the
Company Entities or their Affiliates to pass resolutions to approve the
Financing or authorize the creation or execution of any agreements, documents
or actions in connection therewith (other than any director, manager, officer
or equivalent of the Company Entities who will continue in such a position
following the Closing and the passing of such resolutions), in each case, that
are not contingent on the Closing or would be effective prior to the Closing.
Purchasers acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a
condition to the Closing and that notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchasers\' obligations hereunder are not
conditioned in any manner upon obtaining the Financing or any other financing.
In the event the Financing has not been obtained, Purchaser will continue to
be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Section 2.01, to consummate the Closing. The Company hereby consents
to the reasonable use of the Company Entities\' trademarks, service marks and
logos solely in connection with the Financing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Purchasers shall be responsible for all fees and expenses related to the
Financing. Accordingly, Purchasers shall promptly reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable outside attorneys\' fees of one counsel and fees and expenses of
the Company Entities\' accounting firms engaged to assist in connection with
the Financing, including performing additional requested procedures, reviewing

6.08 or otherwise in connection with the Financing. Purchasers shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller, the Company Entities and their respective Affiliates
and all of their respective directors, officers, managers, employees and
representatives from and against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent arising
from (x) information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Company
Entities or (y) the gross negligence, bad faith or Fraud of the Company, the
Company Entities or Seller.

Enterprises as of the date of this Agreement covering those Persons who are
currently covered by such existing policies with a claims period of six years
from the Closing Date and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less advantageous in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under such existing policies, in each case with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing; provided that in no event
shall the aggregate costs and fees of purchasing such tail policies exceed
three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premiums currently
payable by Truco Enterprises with respect to such existing policies.
Purchasers shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the costs and fees of
purchasing such tail policies.

(c) If, after the Closing, any Company Entity or any of their respective
successors (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person (other
than another Company Entity) and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person (other
than another Company Entity), then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successor of such Company Entity shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in Section 7.02(a) and this Section 7.02(c). The
provisions of this Section 7.02 are intended for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
had by contract or otherwise.

7.03 RandW Insurance Policy. Purchasers shall not, and shall not permit any of
their Affiliates to, amend, modify or waive the subrogation provision of the
RandW Insurance Policy in a manner that is adverse to Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives without the prior written consent of Seller.

7.04 Access to Books and Records. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, Purchasers shall, and shall cause the Company Entities to,
provide Seller and its authorized Representatives, upon advance written
notice, with reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books and
records of the Company Entities for the period prior to the Closing Date for
any legitimate purpose relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Seller,
Purchasers shall not, and shall not cause the Company Entities to, for a
period of six years following the Closing Date, destroy or otherwise dispose
of any of the books and records of the Company Entities for any period prior
to the Closing Date without first giving prior written notice to Seller and
offering to allow Seller at least 60 days to review such books and records
prior to such destruction or disposal and, at Seller\'s expense, remove such
books and records as Seller may select. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchasers shall not be required to (a) provide access or disclose information
to the extent that such access or disclosure would result in the waiver or
forfeiture of any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar
privilege or violate any applicable Law or Contract to which either Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company Entities) is a party, or (b)
provide any information in connection with any dispute or Legal Proceeding
between or among the parties, in which case the applicable rules of discovery
shall govern. 7.05 Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Return Filing. Purchaser2 shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and
timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company
Entities for periods ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Straddle
Period, in each case, the due date of which (taking into account extensions of
time to file) is after the Closing Date (but only if not filed by the Company
Entities prior to the Closing Date). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared
and filed in a manner consistent with (x) the past procedures and practices
and accounting methods of the Company Entities (unless otherwise required by
applicable Law and (y) this Section 7.05); provided that, with respect to the
preparation and filing of the Tax Returns under this Section 7.05(a) with
respect to Income Taxes, such Tax Returns shall reflect all applicable
Transaction Tax Deductions so long as such Transaction Tax Deductions are
"more likely than not" deductible (or deductible at a higher confidence level)
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and for that purpose, the parties agree, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, that (i) deductions described in clause
(X) of the definition of Transaction Tax Deductions (i.e., with respect to
Options) and paid on or within 75 days following the Closing Date and (ii) 70%
of any success based investment banking or other fees described in clause
(Y)(c) of the definition of Transaction Tax Deductions for which the safe
harbor election of Rev. Proc. 2011-29 is made (which election shall be made on
such Tax Returns to the extent applicable) shall be reflected on such Tax
Returns. Purchaser2 shall submit each such Tax Return that is an Income Tax
Return to Seller at least forty-five days prior to the due date (taking into
account any extensions) for Seller\'s review. No later than twenty-five days
following Seller\'s receipt of such Tax Return, Seller shall notify Purchaser2
in writing of any dispute with respect to the manner in which such Tax Return
is prepared, or the related Tax is calculated. If written notice of a dispute
is duly delivered, Purchaser2 and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use
reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser2 and Seller are
unable to resolve a dispute with respect to such Tax Return within ten days
after receipt by Purchaser2 of such notice of dispute, any such dispute shall
be resolved by the Dispute Resolution Firm and any determination by the
Dispute Resolution Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties;
provided, however, if the due date of any such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions) is prior to the date that such dispute is resolved,
Purchaser2 shall be entitled to file such Tax Return as prepared by Purchaser2
and shall then file an amendment to such Tax Return if the Dispute Resolution
Firm determines that the position of Seller with respect to the disputed
matter is correct; provided that if an amendment to the Tax Return is not
filed because it is determined by Purchaser2 that such amendment is not
practicable or because such amendment is otherwise not permitted under
applicable Law, all such computations and amounts payable hereunder, including
the aggregate consideration payable to Seller hereunder, the amount of Tax
refunds (or Overpayment Credits) payable to Seller under Section 7.05(e), and
the amount of "Post-Closing Tax Savings" payable to Seller under Section
7.05(g), shall be computed and paid to Seller as if the applicable Tax Returns
were prepared consistent with such position of Seller. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm incurred pursuant to this Section
7.05(a) shall be borne equally by Purchasers, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand. To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law, the
taxable year of any Company Entity that includes the Closing Date shall be
treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date and Purchaser2 shall
cause the Company Entities to join Purchaser2\'s "consolidated group" (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-1(h)) effective on the day after
the Closing Date. The parties agree that Purchaser2 and its Affiliates and the
Company Entities shall not make an election under Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate items (or any make any similar
election or ratably allocate items under any corresponding provision of state,
local or foreign law) and shall not apply the "next day" rule of Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to any of the Transaction Tax
Deductions. Purchaser2 shall cause the Company Entities to timely file all Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this Section 7.05(a). The preparation and filing
of any Tax Return of a Company Entity that does not relate to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control of
Purchasers.

(b) Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a
Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, gain,
profits, receipts, employment, social security, payroll, sales, use, or other
transaction-based Taxes of any Company Entity for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on a closing of
the books as of the end of the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable
period of any Company Entity that is a partnership or other pass through
entity shall be deemed to end at such time), and the amount of other Taxes of
any Company Entity for a Straddle Period that relates to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period up to and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
Straddle Period and the balance of such Taxes shall be attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

(c) Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, registration, stamp, recording,
documentary, conveyancing, franchise property, transfer, value added and
similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
arising from the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Purchasers
and Purchasers shall indemnify Seller with respect to any such Transfer Taxes.
The party required by Law to file Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes shall do so in the time and manner prescribed by Law. Purchasers shall
provide Seller with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller that such
Transfer Taxes have been paid, or if the transactions are exempt from Transfer
Taxes upon the filing of an appropriate certificate or other evidence of
exemption. For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer Taxes shall not include Income
Taxes.

(d) No Section 338 or 336 Election. Neither Purchaser, Seller, a Company
Entity nor any of their respective Affiliates shall make any election under
Code Section 338 or Code Section 336 (or any similar provisions under state,
local, or foreign Law) with respect to the direct or indirect acquisition of
the Company Entities by Purchaser2.

(e) Tax Refunds. After the Closing Date, except to the extent (i) included as
an asset, or as a reduction in a liability, in Net Working Capital (including
any employment or payroll tax credits included as an asset or reduction in a
liability in Net Working Capital) or as an offset or adjustment to the
calculation of Indebtedness, in each case, as finally determined hereunder or
(ii) attributable to the carryback of any loss from a Post-Closing Tax Period
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall be entitled to all Tax refunds (and
Overpayment Credits) received by Purchaser2 or any of its Affiliates
(including any Company Entity) after the Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period of a Company Entity (including any Tax refunds attributable to the
carryback of items from a Pre-Closing Tax Period). Purchaser2 will pay over to
Seller any such Tax refund (but in all cases within ten business days) after
actual receipt of such Tax refund (or, in the case of any such Overpayment
Credit, promptly (but in all cases within ten business days) upon filing the
applicable Tax Return where such Overpayment Credit is used to reduce Taxes
otherwise payable), less reasonable out of pocket expenses and Taxes incurred
to obtain such Tax refunds or Overpayment Credits. Any Tax refund or
Overpayment Credit received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to
any Company Entity for a Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned
between Seller and Purchaser2 in a manner consistent with the principles set
forth in Section 7.05(b). Subject to Section 7.05(h), upon reasonable written
request by Seller, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, after the
Closing, Purchaser2 shall, and shall cause the Company Entities, at the sole cost and expense of
Seller, (A) to use commercially reasonable efforts to file for and diligently
pursue any Tax refund claims from the Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date and the carrybacks described below in order to legally maximize
and obtain any such Tax refunds or credits and (B) to request a refund (rather
than a credit in lieu of a refund) with respect to Tax refunds for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods. The parties shall cooperate, and cause their Affiliates
to cooperate, with respect to any such refund request or in any such claim for
refund. After the Closing, Purchaser2 shall be entitled to any refunds or
credits of or against any Taxes of any Company Entity other than any refunds
or credits to which Seller is entitled pursuant to this Section 7.05(e)
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not limit any payments under Section
7.05(g)).

(f) Carrybacks. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns under
Section 7.05(a) or as a result of any change in Law extending the taxable
years or periods for which net operating losses may be carried back to prior
taxable years (e.g., beyond 2020), the Company shall, and shall cause the
other Company Entities to, elect to carry back any net operating losses from
the tax period ending on the Closing Date, to prior taxable years to the
fullest extent permitted by Law (using any available short-form or accelerated
procedures (including filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for
applicable state, local and foreign Tax purposes) and, at the sole cost and
expense of Seller, filing amended Tax Returns to the extent necessary) and to
obtain any potential Tax refunds related thereto

(g) Post-Closing Tax Savings. If the Closing occurs after December 31, 2020 or
if and to the extent the Transaction Tax Deductions are not reflected or
included on Tax Returns of the Company Entities for the tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, then, after the Closing,
Purchaser2 shall pay Seller the amount of any reduction in Income Tax
liabilities of Purchaser2 and any of its Affiliates (including the Company
Entities), in any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date and ending on or before December 31, 2026, that are solely attributable
to any Transaction Tax Deductions (or any net operating loss carry forwards
solely attributable to the Transaction Tax Deductions in the tax year in which
the Closing occurs) of the Company Entities that are not deducted in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and are properly deductible in a Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, calculated by comparing the Income
Tax liability without any such Transaction Tax Deductions (including any such
net operating loss carryforwards) and the Income Tax liability actually
payable taking into account such Transaction Tax Deductions (including any
such net operating loss carryforwards). Purchaser2 shall pay over to Seller
any such reduction in Income Tax liability (as finally determined) within
ninety days after the filing of the Tax Return related to such reduction.
Promptly (but in any event within ninety days) following the filing of Tax
Returns for each period ending on or before December 31, 2026, Purchaser2
shall provide to Seller a computation of (x) the usage of the Transaction Tax
Deductions and (y) the amount of any reduction in Income Tax liabilities due
to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.05(g), including providing any supporting
work papers, schedules and other information reasonably related to the
computation of such usage and verification of any amounts payable under this
Section 7.05(g). In the event Seller receives a payment pursuant to this
Section 7.05(g) and it is later determined that the actual reduction in Income
Tax liabilities that are attributable to Transaction Tax Deductions giving
rise to the payment is less than the amount previously determined by
Purchaser2 in calculating such payment (e.g., a portion of the Transaction Tax
Deductions are disallowed as a result of a Legal Proceeding), Seller shall
promptly (but within ten business days) after such determination return the
portion of the payment received by Seller that would not have been paid to
Seller had the payment been calculated correctly (e.g., had the disallowed
Transaction Tax Deductions not been claimed), plus any amount of interest
charged by the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to such underpayment of Tax
attributable to the disallowed Transaction Tax Deductions.

(h) Tax Covenants. Except as otherwise set forth in the following sentence or
pursuant to Section 7.05(a), Section 7.05(e) or Section 7.05(f), from and
after the Closing, Purchasers shall not, and Purchasers shall not cause or
permit any of its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) to, (i) file,
amend or otherwise modify any Tax Return with respect to any Company Entity
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) make or change any Tax election,
accounting method or practice with respect to any Company Entity that has
retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; (iii) extend or waive any
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or any Tax Return of any Company
Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (except at the request of a Taxing
Authority in connection with any audit or other Tax examination or proceeding)
or (iv) enter into any voluntary disclosure or similar agreement with a
Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes of any Company Entity for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without the written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if
such action would either reduce the aggregate consideration payable to Seller
hereunder or reduce the amount of Tax refunds (or Overpayment Credits) payable
to Seller under Section 7.05(e) or reduce the amount of "Post-Closing Tax
Savings" payable to Seller under Section 7.05(g) (provided that the parties
hereby agree that it is per se reasonable for Seller to withhold, condition or
delay consent if any such action would either reduce the aggregate
consideration payable to Seller hereunder or reduce the amount of Tax refunds
(or Overpayment Credits) payable to Seller under Section 7.05(e) or reduce the
amount of "Post-Closing Tax Savings" payable to Seller under Section 7.05(g),
in each case, unless Seller is fully reimbursed and otherwise held harmless
with respect thereto). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Purchaser2
believes that applicable Law requires the Company Entities to take an action
described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence at a "more
likely than not" (or higher) confidence level, then Purchaser2 shall deliver
written notice of such belief along with a description of the legal basis for
determining that such action is so required and Seller shall have twenty days
after delivery of such notice to notify Purchaser2 in writing of any dispute
of such conclusion and provide the legal basis therefor. If written notice of
a dispute and the legal basis therefore is duly delivered, Purchaser2 and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use reasonable efforts to resolve the
dispute. If Purchaser2 and Seller are unable to resolve the dispute within ten
days after receipt by Purchaser2 of such notice of dispute (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree), then such dispute shall be promptly
submitted to and resolved by the Dispute Resolution Firm. The fees and
expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be solely borne by Purchaser2 if
the Dispute Resolution Firm agrees with Seller's position and solely by Seller
if the Dispute Resolution Firm agrees with Purchaser2's position; provided,
further, that if the Dispute Resolution Firm determines that applicable Law
requires any action described in clauses (i) through (iv) to be taken,
Purchaser2 shall have the right to take such action, subject to Seller's right
to review and approve the manner in which such action is taken (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(i) Cooperation. Purchasers, the Company Entities and Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or claim for
refund and any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any
Company Entity and the computation and verification of any amounts paid or
payable to Seller under Section 7.05 (including providing any supporting work
papers, schedules or other information reasonably relevant to such
computation). Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other
party\'s request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or Legal Proceeding, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

(j) Purchase Price Adjustment. Any amount paid by Seller or Purchasers under
Section 1.04 or this Section 7.05 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Final Purchase Price for income Tax purposes, unless, and then solely to the
extent, otherwise required by a final determination under applicable Law.

(k) Tax Treatment. For U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes, the parties shall treat Purchaser2 as the entity that acquires the
Shares so that the Company Entities join Purchaser2's "consolidated group" as
described in Section 7.05(a). The parties shall report, act and file Tax
Returns (including any Tax Returns prepared under this Section 7.05) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with the foregoing treatment and no
party shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with the foregoing treatment.

7.06 Employee Matters.

(a) Purchasers agree that each Business Employee who is employed by any
Company Entity as of immediately prior to the Closing shall, during the
12-month period after the Closing Date, be provided with (i) an annual base
salary (or, in the case of an hourly Business Employee, the base hourly wage
rate) that is at least equal to the annual base salary (or base hourly wage
rate, as applicable) payable to such Business Employee immediately prior to
the Closing, and (ii) to the extent applicable to Business Employees, an
incentive compensation opportunity (excluding equity incentives), comparable
in the aggregate to those (excluding equity incentives) provided to the
Business Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such
information is made available to Purchasers. Furthermore, Purchasers agree to
provide each Business Employee who is employed by any Company Entity as of
immediately prior to the Closing, during the 12-month period after the Closing
Date, other employee benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to the Business Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date, to the extent such information is made available to Purchasers.
If the employment of any Business Employee is terminated within the 12-month
period after the Closing Date, Purchasers will provide such Business Employee
with severance benefits pursuant to Purchasers\' then existing severance
plans; provided, however, that the calculation of any such severance benefits
shall take into account such Business Employee\'s service with any Company
Entity as well as such Business Employee\'s service with Purchasers and their
Affiliates.

(b) Following the Closing Date, Purchasers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained
by Purchasers or their Affiliates in which the Business Employees are eligible
to participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the "Purchaser
Plans") to give each Business Employee service credit for such Business
Employee\'s employment with any Company Entity for purposes of vesting and
eligibility to participate under each applicable Purchaser Plan, as if such
service had been performed with Purchasers or their Affiliates (except for
benefit accrual purposes or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits). In addition, Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) cause to be waived for the Business Employees (and their dependents)
all pre-existing condition exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods, and evidence of insurability
requirements under the Purchaser Plans, and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance, co-payments, and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Business
Employees (and their dependents) under the Employee Benefit Plans or PEO Plans on or before the Closing Date to be
taken into account under any applicable Purchaser Plan.

(c) Purchasers shall provide retention payments in the amounts, and to the
persons, set forth in a schedule to be delivered by Purchasers to Seller after
the date of this Agreement but before Closing. All such payments, together
with the employer\'s share of payroll taxes thereon, shall be borne by
Purchasers.

(d) Following the Closing Date, and provided that the Company Entities hold
the data necessary to do so in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchasers, for
each Business Employee, Purchasers shall provide credit to such Business
Employee for accrued unused sick leave and/or accrued unused paid time off
available to such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date in
the applicable sick leave and/or paid time off policy of Purchasers\' or their
Affiliates.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Business
Employee any right to continued employment with either Purchaser or any of its
respective Affiliates, nor shall anything in this Agreement interfere with the
right of either Purchaser or any of its respective Affiliates to relocate or
terminate the employment of any of the Business Employees at any time after
the Closing Date. Purchasers or their Affiliates, as applicable, shall bear
the cost and expense of the termination of the employment with either
Purchaser or any of its respective Affiliates of any Business Employee on or
after the Closing Date. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall give any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, and no provision of this Section
7.06 shall cause or create any third party beneficiary rights in any current
or former employee, director, consultant or other service provider of any
Company Entity to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.06 or any other
matter related thereto or be construed as an amendment to any Employee Benefit
Plan or other benefit plan.

7.07 Change of Name. Within 10 business days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall (a) change its legal name to "Tortilla Holdings, LLC" and (b) cause
Insignia Truco Holdings, LLC to change its legal name to "Insignia Tortilla
Holdings, LLC" (or, in each case, a name that does not include, in whole or in
part, the word or words "Truco," "Truco Enterprises," "Truco GP," "Meridian,"
"Meridian Brands," or "Meridian Distribution"). To the extent Seller has any
Affiliate whose name includes any of the word or words referenced in this
Section 7.07, Seller shall cause such Affiliate to take the actions required
by Seller pursuant to this Section 7.07 to change such name. Seller shall
deliver evidence of filings with the jurisdiction of formation with respect to
such name changes to Purchasers within 20 business days following the Closing
Date.

7.08 2020 Employee Bonuses. No later than January 15, 2021, Purchasers shall,
or shall cause the applicable Company Entity to, pay to each employee of the
Company Entities set forth on Schedule 7.08 a performance bonus with respect
to the Company Entities' 2020 fiscal year in at least the amount set forth
opposite each such individual's name on Schedule 7.08.

it at law or equity; provided, further, that a failure of (a) Purchasers to

forth in Section 2.01 have been satisfied or waived shall be deemed to be an
intentional and willful breach by Purchasers of the terms of this Agreement,
and (b) Seller to consummate the Closing at a time when all of the conditions
to Closing set forth in Section 2.02 have been satisfied or waived shall be
deemed to be an intentional and willful breach by Seller of the terms of this
Agreement.

Article IX



DEFINITIONS

9.01 Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms when
used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth below:

"Accrued Taxes" means the liability for Income Taxes of the Company Entities
unpaid as of the Closing Date for the (i) taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on and including the Closing Date or (ii) if the Closing Date is after
December 31, 2020, then for the taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on
and including December 31, 2020 and the taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on and including the Closing Date, in each case, computed in accordance
with the past practice (including reporting positions, elections and
accounting methods) of the Company and its Subsidiaries in preparing Tax
Returns for Income Taxes and only with respect to those jurisdictions in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries have previously filed Tax Returns (or
jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries commenced
activities on or after January 1, 2020 and prior to the Closing Date) with
respect to the type of Income Taxes to be taken into account, and, for
purposes of calculating any such liability for Income Taxes, (A) all
Transaction Tax Deductions shall be taken into account to the extent "more
likely than not" deductible (or at a higher level of confidence) in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and consistent with the first proviso of Section 7.05(a),
and applying, to the extent applicable, the seventy percent safe-harbor
election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to any "success based fees," (B) any
financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by or at the
direction of Purchaser2 or any other transactions entered into by or at the
direction of Purchaser2 in connection with the transactions contemplated

3.20(a) 9.03 Interpretation. The headings and captions used in this Agreement and the
table of contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any
capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto or delivered
at the same time and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set
forth in this Agreement. The use of the word "including" herein shall mean
"including, without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
References herein to a specific Section, Subsection, Article, Paragraph,
Schedule, Exhibit, Clause or Recital shall refer, respectively, to Sections,
Subsections, Articles, Paragraphs, Schedules, Exhibits, Clauses and Recitals
of this Agreement. Terms defined in the singular shall have a comparable
meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa. References herein to any
gender shall include each other gender. The word "or" shall not be exclusive.
References to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic form. References
herein to any Person shall include such Person\'s heirs, executors, personal
representatives, administrators, successors and permitted assigns; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 9.03 is intended to authorize
any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by this Agreement.
References herein to a Person in a particular capacity or capacities shall
exclude such Person in any other capacity. Any reference to "days" shall mean
calendar days unless business days are specified; provided that if any action
is required to be done or taken on a day that is not a business day, then such
action shall be required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first
succeeding business day thereafter. References herein to any Contract
(including this Agreement) mean such Contract as amended, restated,
supplemented or modified from time to time in accordance with the terms
thereof; provided that, with respect to any Contract listed (or required to be

(but excluding any purchase orders, work orders or statements of work) must
also be listed on the appropriate section of the Disclosure Schedule. With
respect to the determination of any period of time, the word "from" means

including." References herein to any Law shall be deemed also to refer to such
Law, as amended, and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If any
party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject
matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which such party has
not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that such party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" (or similar phrases) shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." An accounting term not otherwise defined in this Agreement
has the meaning assigned to it in GAAP. All amounts in this Agreement are
stated and shall be paid in United States dollars. Any information or
materials shall be deemed provided, made available or delivered to Purchasers

Room") as of 12:01 a.m., Central Time two days before the date of this

Article X



MISCELLANEOUS



10.01 Survival. Each of the representations and warranties (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.25, 4.06, 5.08 and
5.09, which shall survive the Closing indefinitely), and each of the covenants
and agreements that requires performance prior to the Closing, in each case,
as set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder,
shall terminate at and as of the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, the sole
and exclusive recourse of Purchaser for any breach of any such representations
and warranties shall be against the RandW Insurance Policy. Each of the
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered hereunder that requires performance at or after the Closing shall
survive the Closing indefinitely (with the parties hereto agreeing to
contractually lengthen any applicable statutes of limitation) unless such
covenant or agreement specifies a term, in which event such covenant or
agreement shall survive for such specified term plus 90 days. Nothing in this
Section 10.01 eliminates any Liability for Fraud. "Fraud" means actual and
intentional common law fraud under Delaware Law by a party to this Agreement
with respect to the representations and warranties made by such party in this
Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any claim based on
constructive knowledge or negligent misrepresentation.

10.02 Notices. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given when personally delivered, one
business day after deposit with Federal Express or similar overnight courier
service, upon transmission by electronic mail (with confirmation of
transmission) if successfully transmitted during normal business hours and, if
not, the next business day after successful transmission or three days after
being mailed by first class mail, return receipt requested. Notices, demands

10.03 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
attached hereto), the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
contain the entire agreement and understanding of the parties in respect of
their subject matter and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
(oral or written) between the parties with respect to such subject matter. The
Exhibits and Schedules constitute a part hereof as though set forth in full
above.

10.04 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) Purchasers
shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of either Purchaser incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the fees, costs and
expenses of its financial advisors, accountants and counsel, (b) Seller shall
pay the fees, costs and expenses of Seller incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the fees, costs and expenses of its financial
advisors, accountants and counsel and (c) the Company shall pay the fees,
costs and expenses of the Company Entities incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the fees, costs and expenses of its financial
advisors, accountants and counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 10.04, all fees, costs and expenses referenced in subsections (b)
and (c) shall be Transaction Expenses.

10.05 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
supplemented, cancelled or discharged, except by a written instrument executed
by Purchasers and Seller; provided that with respect to any amendment,
supplementation or modification to this Section 10.05, Section 10.06, Section
10.09, Section 10.10 and Section 10.17 (and any provision of this Agreement to
the extent an amendment, supplement or modification of such provision would
modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) that is adverse to
any Financing Source, the prior written consent of the adversely affected
Financing Source shall be required before any such amendment, supplementation
or modification may become effective. No failure to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. No waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other
provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between
the parties. No extension of time for performance of any obligations or other
acts hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement shall be deemed to be an
extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or any other
acts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Section
10.05, Section 10.06, Section 10.09, Section 10.10 and Section 10.17 (and any
other provision of this Agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision
would modify the substance of the foregoing) may not be waived in a manner
that is adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written consent of
the adversely affected Financing Source and any purported waiver by any party
hereto in a manner that does not comply with this Section 10.05 will be void. 10.06 Binding Effect; Assignment. The rights and obligations of this Agreement
shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Agreement shall be construed to give any other Person any legal or equitable
rights hereunder, except that (i) the DandO Indemnified Persons are express
third party beneficiaries of Section 7.02, and (ii) the Financing Sources are
express third party beneficiaries of Section 10.05, this Section 10.06,
Section 10.09, Section 10.10 and Section 10.17. Except as provided in this
Agreement, the rights and obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned by
any party without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided
that either Purchaser may, without the consent of any other party or parties,
assign its rights or obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates of such
Purchaser or for collateral security purposes to any lender providing
financing to such Purchaser; provided that no such assignment shall receive
such Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this Section 10.06 shall be null and void.

10.07 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic mail
transmission of a ".pdf" or other similar data file shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

10.08 Disclosure Schedule. Any information set forth in one section of the
Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to apply to another section of the
Disclosure Schedule to the extent its relevance to such other section is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure (notwithstanding the
omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto on, or the absence of, any
Schedule relating to such other section of the Agreement). The specification
of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is
not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items not included, are or are not required to be
disclosed, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the fact of the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy with
any party as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material) or that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so
included, or other items not included, are within or outside the ordinary
course of business. No information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule will
be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the parties\' representations and
warranties. The information contained in the Disclosure Schedule is disclosed
solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party to any third party of
any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any
Contract.

10.09 Governing Law; Interpretation. This Agreement shall be interpreted and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware. Any
and all Legal Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, shall be governed by the
internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict-
of-laws or other rule that would result in the application of the laws of a
different jurisdiction; provided, however, that in any Legal Proceeding
brought against or involving any of the Financing Sources in accordance with
Section 10.10, the foregoing shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of
law rules of such state that would result in the application of the laws of
any other state.

10.10 Forum Selection; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) Any Legal Proceeding against either Purchaser, the Company or Seller,
arising out of, relating to, or with respect to, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the state or
federal courts located in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (the
"Designated Courts"), and the parties accept the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Designated Courts for the purpose of any such Legal Proceeding. Each party
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such Legal Proceeding in any Designated Court and hereby further irrevocably
waives any claim that any such Legal Proceeding brought in the Designated
Courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document sent in accordance with
Section 10.10 shall be effective service of process in any such Legal
Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge and irrevocably agree that it will not bring or support, or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support, any Legal Proceeding,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against or involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance of services thereunder or related thereto in any forum other
than the state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT
OF, OR WITH RESPECT TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY) OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM
OR COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS SECTION 10.10(b).
ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF
THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

10.11 Specific Performance. Each of the parties agrees that this Agreement is
intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its
terms, that Purchasers, the Company and Seller would be irreparably harmed if
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate
remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which a
non-breaching party may be entitled at Law, a non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive
relief without the posting of any bond to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof. The parties
further agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief without
the posting of any bond to prevent breaches of the IP APA by Purchaser1 and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of the IP APA by Purchaser1
(including causing the closing thereunder to occur if the conditions to the
obligations of Purchaser1 to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby
have been satisfied). Each party further waives any defense that a remedy at
Law would be adequate in any Legal Proceeding for specific performance or
injunctive relief hereunder or under the IP APA.

10.12 Arm\'s Length Negotiations; Drafting. Each party represents and warrants
to the other parties that before executing this Agreement, such party has
fully informed itself of the terms, contents, conditions and effects of this
Agreement, such party has relied solely and completely upon its own judgment
in executing this Agreement and such party has had the opportunity to seek and
has obtained the advice of counsel before executing this Agreement, which is
the result of arm\'s length negotiations conducted by and among the parties
and their respective counsel. This Agreement shall be deemed drafted jointly
by the parties and nothing shall be construed against one party or another as
the drafting party.

10.13 Time. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

10.14 Confidentiality; Publicity. Upon execution of this Agreement, Purchasers
will issue a press release regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in the form attached hereto as Exhibit J. Except for the
press release referenced in the preceding sentence and as otherwise required
by Law or applicable requirements of any stock exchange, no press release or
public announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or, prior to the Closing, any other announcement or communication
(other than communications by the Company Entities, Purchasers or any of their
respective officers, managers, employees and agents in the ordinary course of
business) to the employees, customers, suppliers or other business relations
of the Company Entities or Purchasers shall be issued or made without the
joint approval of Purchasers and Seller, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the parties shall use reasonable efforts
to agree upon the text of any such press release or public announcement prior
to its release; provided that Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to
communicate with their respective investors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, further, that no party shall be
required to mention or otherwise use the name of another party or its
Affiliates (other than the Company Entities) in such press release or public
announcement and such omission shall not be used as a basis for withholding
approval of such press release or public announcement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each party may make announcements and communications regarding this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby consisting solely of
information contained in and otherwise consistent with any previously issued
press release or public announcement to such party\'s employees, customers,
suppliers and other interested parties without the consent of the other
parties.

10.15 Company Representation. Each Purchaser, for itself and on behalf of its
directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, and the Company, for itself and on behalf of the other Company
Entities and its and their respective directors, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, hereby agree that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between either Purchaser, any Company
Entity or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, in any matter involving this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
Kirkland and Ellis LLP may represent Seller or such Affiliate in such dispute, even though the interests
of Seller or such Affiliate may be directly adverse to Purchasers, the Company
Entities and/or their Affiliates and even though Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have
represented the Company Entities in a matter substantially related to such
dispute. Each Purchaser, for itself and on behalf of its directors,
equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, and the
Company, for itself and on behalf of the other Company Entities and its and
their respective directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, further agree that, as to all communications prior
to the Closing among Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Seller and the Company Entities
that relate to the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and shall
not pass to or be claimed by either Purchaser or any Company Entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
either Purchaser or any Company Entity and a third party (other than Seller or
Insignia Capital Group, LP or any of its Affiliates (other than "portfolio
companies" of Insignia Capital Group, LP), officers, directors or employees)
after the Closing, the Company Entities may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Kirkland and
Ellis LLP to such third party; provided, however, that no Company Entity may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.
