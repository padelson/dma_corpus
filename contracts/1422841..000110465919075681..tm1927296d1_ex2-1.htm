WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee), Parent and Merger Sub deemed it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, to consummate the merger, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of Merger Sub with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), all in accordance with the BVI
Business Companies Act, 2004, as amended (the " _BVI Act_ "), of the British
Virgin Islands;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the Company (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee), Parent and Merger Sub have approved
the Merger, this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) has approved a resolution
recommending to the shareholders of the Company that they adopt this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, Parent is entering into voting agreements with
certain shareholders of the Company (the " _Voting Agreements_ ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I 
  
 THE MERGER

  



  

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the BVI Act, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Company_ ") and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

  



  

   

 



    



  

SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, (a) on the date as soon as
practicable (and, in any event, within three Business Days) following the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of those
conditions), at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue,
Boston, Massachusetts or (b) on such other date or time as may be mutually
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Closing take place prior to the Inside
Date (determined after giving effect to any extensions as set forth in the
definition thereof) without the prior written consent of Parent. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_."

as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Plan of Merger_ ") with the Registrar of Corporate
Affairs of the British Virgin Islands (the " _Registrar_ ") pursuant to
Section 171 of the BVI Act, and at the Closing, shall make any and all other
filings or recordings required under the BVI Act in connection with the Merger
(including the filing by Merger Sub's registered agent of a letter confirming
it has no objections to the Merger). The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Articles of Merger are duly registered by the Registrar, or
at such other date or time as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing
(subject to the requirements of the BVI Act) and shall specify in the Articles
of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement, the Plan of Merger, the Articles of Merger and in
the relevant provisions of the BVI Act. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the assets (including
property), rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall continue in the Surviving Company, and all claims, debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall continue as the
claims, debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

  



  

SECTION 1.5 _Memorandum of Association and Articles of
Association_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Memorandum of
Association (the " _Company Memorandum_ ") and Articles of Association (the "
_Company Articles_ ") of the Company shall be amended so that they read in

be the memorandum of association and articles of association of the Surviving
Company until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided
by applicable Law.

  



  

SECTION 1.6 _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior
to the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

ARTICLE II 
  
 EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES

  



  

SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) Each ordinary share, of no par value of the Company (a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
paragraph (b) below and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
$27.10 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, but subject to _Section 2.5_ , all Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each ordinary share of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable ordinary share of the Surviving Company.

  



  

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of the Company shall be changed
into a different number of shares or a different class or shall have different
terms, in each case as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization,
share split (including a reverse share split), stock dividend or any
other similar event, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such event so as to provide Parent and the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

  



  

SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. (a)
At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right of the holder of
such Company Stock Option to receive, for each Share subject to such Company
Stock Option, an amount in cash, without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax, equal to the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price, with the
aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully
vested and shall be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the
right of the holder of such RSU to receive, for each RSU, an amount in cash,
without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax,
equal to the Merger Consideration, with the aggregate amount of such payment
rounded up to the nearest cent.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Phantom Unit, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time
into the right of the holder of such Company Phantom Unit to receive, for
each Company Phantom Unit, an amount in cash, without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax, equal to the Merger
Consideration, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to
the nearest cent.

  



  

(d) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and, in any
event, not later than the third Business Day thereafter), the Surviving
Company shall pay through its payroll system the amounts due and payable under
this _Section 2.2(d)_ to each holder of Company Stock Options, RSUs and
Company Phantom Units.

  



  

(e) With respect to the Company 2016 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ "), the Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to provide
that (i) no new Offering (as defined in the ESPP) shall commence following the
date of this agreement, (ii) no individual participating in the ESPP shall be
permitted to (A) increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll
contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this
agreement, or (B) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or
following the date of this agreement, and (iii) no individual who is not
participating in the ESPP as of the date of this agreement may commence
participation in the ESPP. No later than three Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding offering that is in progress on such date
shall terminate and be the final offering under the ESPP and the accumulated
payroll deductions of each participant under the ESPP will be returned to the
participant by the Surviving Company pursuant to the terms of the ESPP,
without the issuance of any Shares.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices to each holder of Company Stock Options, RSUs or Phantom Stock Units
setting forth each holder's rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock
Plan and stating that such Company Stock Options, RSUs or Phantom Stock Units
shall be treated in the manner set forth in this _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board or any
committee thereof, as applicable, shall take all actions necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.2_ and to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, (i) the Company Stock Plans and the ESPP shall terminate and
(ii) no holder of a Company Stock Option, RSU, Company Phantom Unit or other
Person shall have any rights with respect to any equity incentive award to
acquire the capital stock or shares, as applicable, of the Company, the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, except the right to receive
the payment contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ in cancellation and settlement
thereof.

SECTION 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company) with a reputable bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (which may be the Company's transfer agent) to act
as paying agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Paying Agent, to be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of
the Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments of
the Merger Consideration due pursuant to this Article.

  



  



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and after receipt by the Paying Agent
from the Company's transfer agent of all information reasonably necessary to
enable the Paying Agent to effect the mailing set forth in this _Section
2.3(b)_ ), the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of an outstanding certificate (a " _Certificate_ "), if any,
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by
such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect
thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

  



  

(c) The Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated
Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), if any, the
Merger Consideration for each such Book-Entry Share, upon receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), and such Book-Entry
Shares shall then be cancelled.

  



  

(d) No interest will be paid to or accrued for the benefit of holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(e) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the
Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(f) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_ , each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(g) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(h) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) no investment of such cash shall
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) such investments in all events shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more
than 30 days, or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit of,
the United States of America. If for any reason (including investment losses)
the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the
payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to
such deficiency. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be payable to the Surviving Company.

  



  

(i) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to
it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have
been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Company
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(j) The Surviving Company shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying
Agent in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(k) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Paying Agent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying
Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(l) None of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to the date on which the related
Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

SECTION 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Company and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, including the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, RSUs or Company
Phantom Units, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax Law. Except with respect to
payments in the nature of compensation to be made to employees or
former employees of the Company, if Parent, the Surviving Company or the
Paying Agent determines that an amount is required to be deducted and
withheld, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to provide the payee, at
least three Business Days prior to the date the applicable payment is
scheduled to be made: (a) with written notice of the intent to deduct and
withhold, which shall include a copy of the calculation of the amount to be
deducted and withheld; and (b) a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or
other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding (or reduce
such withholding). To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate taxing authority and treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

SECTION 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. At or from the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist or
be outstanding, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to be a
shareholder of the Company (and shall not be a shareholder of the Surviving
Company) and shall cease to have any rights thereto (including any right to
receive such holder's portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 2.1(a)_ ), subject to and except for such rights as are granted
under Section 179 of the BVI Act. If any holder of Shares (other than a holder
of Shares who consented in writing to the Company Shareholder Approval) fails
to give written notice of its election to dissent from the Merger under
Section 179 of the BVI Act within twenty (20) days immediately following the
date of the Shareholder Notice, or otherwise fails validly to dissent in
accordance with the terms of Section 179 of the BVI Act, then the rights of
such holder under Section 179 of the BVI Act shall cease to exist, and the
underlying Shares shall be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ ,
and shall entitle the holder thereof only to receive compensation in
accordance with such _Section 2.1(a)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice, and in any event notice within one Business Day, of any notice or
purported notice received by the Company of any shareholder's intent to
exercise and/or exercise of rights pursuant to Section 179 of the BVI Act,
the withdrawal of any such notice and any other documents served upon the
Company pursuant to or in connection with Section 179 of the BVI Act or a
shareholder's dissent or appraisal rights. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as
otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of
competent jurisdiction, make any payment with respect to any such exercise
of dissenter's rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights.

 ~~~~(a)  _Section 3.11(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a
true and complete list of each material Company Plan, other than Foreign
Plans, and _Section 3.11(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a
true and complete list of each material Foreign Plan. " _Company Plan_ "
means each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ ")) and all stock
purchase, stock option, equity or equity-based incentive, severance,
retention, employment, consulting, change-in-control, fringe benefit,
bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, medical, dental, vision, life,
disability, retirement and all other employee benefit plans,
agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject
to ERISA (including any funding mechanism therefor now in effect or required
in the future as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise), whether formal or informal, under which any current or former
employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or its
Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits or the Company or
its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability. " _Foreign Plan_
" means each Company Plan that primarily covers current or former employees,
directors or independent contractors of the Company or its Subsidiaries based
outside of the United States and/or that is subject to any Law other than
U.S., federal, state or local law (other than any plan or program that is
required by statute or maintained by a Governmental Authority to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries contributes pursuant to applicable Law).

  



  

(b) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has furnished or made
available to Parent a current, accurate and complete copy of the plan
document and any amendments thereto and, to the extent applicable: (i) any

(c) Each Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination, advisory or opinion letter, as
applicable, from the IRS that it is so qualified (or the deadline for
obtaining such a letter has not expired as of the date of this Agreement) and
to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of
such letter that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualified status of such Company Plan. Each Foreign Plan, if required to be
registered or approved by a Governmental Authority, has been registered or
approved and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities, and nothing has occurred since the date of the most recent
approval or application therefor relating to any such Foreign Plan that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect any such approval or good
standing.

  



  

(d) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any other entity which,
together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would be treated as a
single employer under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "
_ERISA Affiliate_ ") has any liability in respect of or has in the past six
years sponsored, maintained, contributed to or had any liability in
respect of (i) any defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA, whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA), (ii) any plan subject

(including a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA),
(iii) any "multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section 413(c) of the
Code), or (iv) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the

and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of, post-employment life or health insurance benefits or coverage for
any current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any
beneficiary thereof, except as may be required under Part 6 of the Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA, or similar state Laws and at the sole expense of such
individual, or to the extent there are employer-provided payments for COBRA
coverage pursuant to a Company Plan set forth on _Section 3.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_. No event has occurred and no condition exists that
would, by reason of the Company's affiliation with any of its ERISA
Affiliates, subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
material Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other Liability imposed by ERISA, the
Code or other applicable Law.

  



  

(e) With respect to the Company Plans, except to the extent that the
inaccuracy of any of the representations set forth in this paragraph (e),

expected to result in material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole:

  



  

(i) each Company Plan has been established, funded and administered in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, and no prohibited transaction, as
described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred

made under the terms of any Company Plan or by applicable Law have been made
or have been accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Plan and applicable Laws; and

participant or beneficiary pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, relating to the Company Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Company Plans or the assets of any of the
trusts under any of the Company Plans (other than routine claims
for benefits); and

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(iii) each Company Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
complied in form and operation with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code as in effect from time-to-time.

  



  

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other event) will (i) result in any payment becoming due
to any current or former employee, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the compensation or
benefits payable, including equity benefits, to any current or former
employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of

a result of or in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event), by any current or former employee, officer, director or other service
provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be characterized as
an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).
No Company Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under
Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (i) a party to or
otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with
a labor union or other labor organization, or (ii) as of the date of this

organization. As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is the subject of any material proceeding asserting that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an "Unfair Labor
Practice" (as defined under the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to
compel it to bargain with any labor union or other labor organization nor is
there pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, nor

material labor strike, walk-out, work stoppage or lockout involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2018 and through the

(a) Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to the Effective Time, will have

26

 



    



  

SECTION 4.5 _Financing_. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company
complete and correct unredacted (except in the case of the Debt Fee Letter,
which may be redacted in a customary manner solely with respect to fee
amounts, yield or interest rate caps, original issue discount amounts and
"flex" provisions so long as such redacted information does not adversely
affect the conditionality, availability of the Debt Financing or reduce the
aggregate principal amount thereof) copies of the following, including all
annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto: (i) commitment
letter, dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and Affiliates of
Advent International Corporation that are party thereto (such Persons are
collectively referred to as " _Sponsor_ ") (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_
"), pursuant to which Sponsor has committed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, to provide equity financing in an amount set
forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), (ii) commitment letter, dated as
of the date hereof, between AI Aqua Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and an Affiliate of Parent (and any Person to whom the Debt Commitment Letter
is assigned in accordance with the terms thereof, the " _Borrower_ "), and
the Debt Financing Sources party thereto (collectively, the " _Lender Parties_
") (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Equity Commitment
Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the Lender
Parties have committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, to provide debt financing in an amount set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ " and together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_
") and (iii) fee letter, dated as of the date hereof, between the Borrower
and the Debt Financing Sources party thereto (the " _Debt Fee Letter_ ").

  



  

(b) Assuming the funding of the net proceeds from the Financing Commitments,
at the Closing, Parent will have the funds necessary to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated herein, including without limitation,
payment in cash of the aggregate Merger Consideration on the Closing Date,
the aggregate amounts payable to holders of Company Stock Options, RSUs and
Company Phantom Units, repayment of the Paid Off Indebtedness and all related
fees and expenses, in each case with cash and cash equivalents.

  



  

(c) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
by or to Parent, Borrower, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
or any other financing transaction (including, without limitation, the
Financing Commitments) be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or
Merger Sub hereunder.

  



  

(d) None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified as of the
date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, the respective
commitments contained therein have not been terminated, replaced, withdrawn or
rescinded, nor is any such amendment, modification, termination, replacement,
withdrawal or rescission currently contemplated or the subject of current
discussions (in each case, other than in connection with or arising from the
Best Efforts Debt Refinancing) or otherwise amended, restated, amended and
restated, waived, supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect. No
lender has notified Parent or Merger Sub in writing of its intention to
terminate or withdraw the Financing Commitments, and Parent does not know of
any facts or circumstances that may be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied. As of
the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect
and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Borrower
and Merger Sub, as applicable, and the other parties to the Equity Commitment
Letter and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter, in each case, subject to the Equitable Exceptions. To the
knowledge of the Parent, the Borrower or Merger Sub, there are no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements (other than the Debt Fee
Letter) relating to the Financing Commitments or the Financing.

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

(e) The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies, arrangements or agreements related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing (including any "flex" provisions contained in
the Debt Fee Letter), other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments and the Debt Fee Letter, that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect (x) the ability of Parent or Borrower to satisfy
any of the conditions to the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing within its
control or, (y) the availability of the Debt Financing or the Equity
Financing on the Closing Date (other than by virtue of the imposition of
original issue discount, which may be funded at the election of Borrower as
provided in the Debt Fee Letter and/or by an increase in the amount of the
Equity Financing).

  



  

(f) As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under the
Financing Commitments or result in a failure of any condition of the Financing
Commitments or, to the knowledge of the Parent, the Borrower or Merger Sub,
result in any portion of the Financing being unavailable on the Closing
Date, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of any fact, event or other
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub in the Equity Financing Commitments and of the Borrower in the Debt
Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material respect.

  



  

(g) As of the date hereof and assuming (x) the truth and accuracy of the
representations set forth in _Article III_ in a manner that would satisfy the
condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ and (y) the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ , and other than as a result of the
incurrence of the Best Efforts Debt Financing in lieu of the Debt Financing
Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to believe that any of the
conditions in the Financing Commitments will fail to be timely satisfied or
that the full amount of the Financing will not be funded at the Closing.

  



  

(h) Parent, Borrower and Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing Commitment to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 4.6 _Solvency_. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to
Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger, immediately
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger, the Financing (or Best Efforts Debt Financing, as
applicable), any repayment of existing indebtedness contemplated by this
Agreement, the Financing Commitment or the Best Efforts Debt Financing, and
the payment of all related fees and expenses), the Surviving Company will be
Solvent. With respect to the Surviving Company, " _Solvent_ " means that, as
of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of
the assets of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
exceeds, as of such date, the sum of all "debts" of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent liabilities, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal
Law governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors; (b) the Surviving
Company will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the business in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged; and (c) the Surviving Company will be able to pay its
debts, including contingent liabilities, as they mature.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

SECTION 4.7 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates.

  



  

SECTION 4.8 _Regulatory Status_. As of the date hereof, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub is aware of any fact or circumstance relating to its or any of
its Affiliates' (including any portfolio company Affiliate) respective
businesses, assets, liabilities, operations or legal status that would
reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the parties to obtain, the
expiration of any waiting period applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Affiliates under any Antitrust Law applicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any authorization, consent, order, declaration or
approval of any Governmental Entity in the United States required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 4.9 _Exclusivity of Representation and Warranties_.  ~~~~(a)
Other than the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set
forth in _Article III_ or any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
6.3(d)_ , which Parent and Merger Sub are relying upon, Parent and Merger Sub
are not, in entering into this Agreement or in consummating any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, relying in any respect on, and the Company
and its Affiliates shall have no liability to Parent and Merger Sub and
their Affiliates with respect to, any other representation, warranty,
statement, document, prediction or other piece of information, written or
oral, express or implied, made or provided by the Company or any of its
Affiliates, or any Representative of any of the foregoing (including any
management presentation, any discussions regarding due diligence and any
projections or other forecasts as to future performance), and each of Parent
and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees that it will
not bring any Action in respect of any such other representation, warranty,
statement, document, prediction or other piece of information.

  



  

(b) Nothing in this _Section 4.9_ is intended to modify or limit in any
respect Parent's and Merger Sub's reliance on any of the representations or
warranties of the Company in _Article III_.

respective directors, officers and employees shall, and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other
Representatives to (i) immediately cease all discussions and negotiations
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) thereafter not directly or

Company Board (and, if a special committee has been formed, acting upon the
recommendation of such special committee to take such action) determines in

its Subsidiaries in response to a request therefor by such Person if prior to
furnishing any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, such Person, the Company: (A) gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such Person and of the Company's intention to
furnish non-public information to, or enter into discussions or

delivers to Parent a copy of, an executed confidentiality agreement with
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written and
oral information furnished to such Person and other provisions not materially
less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement (i) need not prohibit the making of an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
may contain any standstill or similar provision and (iii) shall expressly
provide that nothing therein shall restrict the Company from complying with
the provisions of this _Section 5.2_ ) and, substantially concurrently with
the furnishing of such non-public information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such non-public
information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).

Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives may (without
any determination by the Company Board or any committee thereof or
consultation with its financial advisors or outside legal counsel) direct any
Person to this Agreement, including the specific provisions of this _Section

it will not, and shall ensure that each of its Subsidiaries will not release
or permit the release of any Person from, or amend, waive or permit the
amendment or waiver of any provision of, any "standstill" or similar agreement
or provision to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes a
party or under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or acquires
any rights, and (ii) will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause
to be enforced each such agreement or provision at the request of Parent.

  



  

   

32

 



    



  

(b)  _No Adverse Recommendation Change_. Neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall: (i) withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent, or permit the withholding, withdrawal or modification in a
manner adverse to Parent of, the Company Recommendation (an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); (ii) recommend the approval, acceptance or
adoption of, or approve, recommend or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other analogous agreement or Contract constituting, or which provides for,
contemplates or is intended or would reasonably be expected to result
directly or indirectly in, an Acquisition Transaction; or (iv) resolve, agree
in writing or publicly propose to, or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to agree or publicly propose to, take any of the actions referred to in this
_Section 5.2(b)(i)_ through _(iv)_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement (including _Section 5.3_ and _Section 5.5_ ), at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board (or, if a
special committee shall have been formed, acting upon the recommendation of
such special committee to take such action) may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change (and in the case of clause (i) below, may also
take action pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ ):

  



  

   

33

 



    



   

  

(i) if: (A) the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal that is made to the Company and is not withdrawn;

the provisions of this _Section 5.2_ ;

  



  

(C) the Company provides Parent, at least 24 hours (or such shorter notice
period provided to the members of the Company Board or, if applicable, the
special committee) prior to any meeting of the Company Board (or, if
applicable, the special committee) at which the Company Board (or, if
applicable, the special committee) will consider and determine whether such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, with a written notice specifying
the date and time of such meeting, the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the potential action by the
Company Board (or, if applicable, the special committee) (including a copy of
any draft Contract relating to such Acquisition Proposal) and the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(D) the Company Board (or, if applicable, the special committee) determines

other similar statute (including any "moratorium," "control share

such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed in all material respects on a reasonably current
basis of the status and material developments, discussions or negotiations

any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated pursuant to Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (ii) if required
by applicable Law, issuing a press release disclosing the Company has
received a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
has determined in compliance with _Section 5.2(a)_ could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (provided that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 5.2(a)_ and (B) the Company
provides Parent notice, and a copy of such press release, a reasonable time
in advance of such release); _provided_ that any such disclosure shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company fails to
expressly and publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation in such disclosure
or similar communication. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the issuance of a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9
of the Exchange Act (or similar statement pursuant to any requirement of
applicable Law), without more, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

hereof (and such terms and conditions shall not contain any conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ nothing herein or in any other provision of this Agreement
shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent
and the Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, (A) Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their Affiliates to waive any term or condition of this Agreement,
(B) Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates to pay fees or other
amounts that, taken as a whole, materially exceed the aggregate fees and other
amounts contemplated to be paid by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt
Fee Letter as of the date of this Agreement, or (C) seek any additional
equity financing or commitments. In the event that Alternative Debt Financing
is arranged in accordance with this _Section 5.6(b)_, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall mean the commitment letters for such Alternative Debt
Financing (as amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with
_Section 5.6(a)_). In the event that Alternative Debt Financing shall be
obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)_, the parties shall comply with the
covenants in _Section 5.6(a)_  with respect to such Alternative Debt
Financing _mutatis mutandis_. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain and
consummate the Alternative Debt Financing.

  



  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of Parent's, the Borrower's and Merger Sub's efforts to obtain the
Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, and giving the Company prompt
notice of any material change (adverse or otherwise) with respect to the
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within one
Business Day) if at any time prior to the Closing:

  



  

(i) any Financing Commitment is terminated for any reason whether or not such
attempted or purported termination is valid;

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

(ii) Parent, the Borrower or Merger Sub obtains knowledge of any breach or
default or any threatened breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without due notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any of the
Financing Commitments;

  



  

(iii) Parent, the Borrower or Merger Sub receives any written communication
from any Person with respect to any (A) actual, potential or threatened
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Commitments or (B) dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any of the Financing Commitments;

  



  

(iv) any Equity Financing Source or Debt Financing Source refuses to provide,
or notifies Parent or Merger Sub (in writing) an intent to refuse to provide,
all or any portion of the Financing Commitments contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively, on the terms
set forth therein; or

  



  

(v) Parent, the Borrower or Merger Sub, for any reason, no longer believes in
good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
Commitments on the terms described in the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter, as applicable.

  



  

Promptly after receipt of written notice by Parent and Merger Sub from the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably
requested in writing by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (i) through (v) of the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ ,
none of Parent, the Borrower nor Merger Sub shall be required to provide
information to the extent that the provision thereof would violate
any attorney-client privilege, law, rule or regulation or any confidentiality
obligation binding on Parent or Merger Sub and/or any of their respective
Affiliates.

  



  

(d) It is understood and agreed that after the date of this Agreement, Parent
intends to pursue, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to

facility and/or senior unsecured notes (the " _Best Efforts Debt Financing_
"), in lieu of the Debt Financing, to effect the Parent Refinancing, satisfy
in full the Paid Off Indebtedness, to finance the transactions contemplated
hereby and to pay related fees and expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the conditions
set forth in Article VI, to the extent applicable to Company's obligations
under  _Section 5.6_ in respect of any Best Efforts Debt Financing only,
shall be deemed to be satisfied with respect thereto notwithstanding that the
Company has breached or otherwise failed to comply with its obligations in
respect of the Best Efforts Debt Financing only and no such breach or failure
shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach for purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of _Article VII_ , or otherwise form the basis of a
failure to effect the Closing by Parent.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, to the extent Parent and Merger
Sub may reasonably request in connection with the Debt Financing and/or the
Best Efforts Debt Financing, use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall

Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and
each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending 12 months thereafter, to provide any Company Employee terminated during

prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (solely including,
health, welfare and defined contribution retirement benefits, but excluding
change in control benefits, retention bonuses, equity-based incentive awards
and defined benefit retirement benefits) that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits maintained for and provided
to such Company Employees under Company Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Company to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of

arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after
the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company (each,
a " _Parent Plan_ ") for the Company Employees' service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company
Plan, except to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication
of benefits. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any

company that is set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Company Key Executive Severance Plan with respect to all employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are participants under such plan.

  



  

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time shall, at any time prior to 90 days after the Effective
Time, take any action that would result in a "mass layoff" or "plant
closing" as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, as amended (" _WARN_ "), or comparable conduct
under any applicable state Law, affecting in whole or in part any facility,
site of employment, operating unit or employee of the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries without complying fully with the requirements of WARN or such
applicable state Law; _provided_ , _that_ , this _Section 5.7(e)_ shall not
apply to a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" that arises as a result of, based
on, or otherwise relates to the sale of any assets owned by the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.7_, express or implied, is intended
to require Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to
continue to employ any of the Company Employees for any specific period of
time or to confer upon any Person that is not a party to this Agreement any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under this
Agreement, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term
or condition of employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does,

any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates or (ii) limit the right
of Parent or its Affiliates to amend or terminate any Company Plan or any
other employee benefit plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement limits Parent's or its Affiliates' obligations to comply with the
terms of any Company Plan.

required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) any Action commenced or threatened in writing against, relating
to or involving the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby;

and officers' liability insurance policy for the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their present and former directors, officers and employees who
are currently covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company that shall provide such
directors, officers and employees with coverage for six years following the
Closing Date of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company pay
with respect to such tail policy in respect of any one policy year more than
300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior

coverage currently maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , that if the Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 5.10(c)_ , it shall be entitled to obtain
comparable insurance as possible for each year within such six-year period for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. Following the Closing, the
Surviving Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall

agreement (including as may be contained in any employment agreement or
arrangement) in effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Indemnified Person as of the date hereof.

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity or

5.10_.

  



  

(f) This _Section 5.10_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Persons entitled to indemnification. The

(ii) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been disclosed, announced,

terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ ,
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ , and (C)
within twelve months after the date of such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement contemplating an Acquisition Transaction (whether

reference to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be
deemed to be a reference to "35%") and (B) a capital raising equity offering

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent the Breakup Fee. "
_Breakup Fee_ " means a payment in cash of a non-refundable fee in the amount
of $34,132,500. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Breakup
Fee on more than one occasion. In the event that Parent shall become entitled

_Section 7.3(d)_ , the receipt of the payment of the Breakup Fee and any such
other obligations (if received) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages, and
the Company shall not have any other liability or obligation to Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the failure of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated

(d) _Costs of Recovery_. Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other
parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Company fails to
pay the Breakup Fee due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Company for the amounts (or any portion thereof) set forth in this
_Section 7.3_ , Company shall pay to Parent its documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due from

Cooperation Expenses_ "). " _Parent Termination Fee_ " means a payment in
cash of a non-refundable fee in the amount of $54,611,815. In no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. In the event that the Company shall become entitled to receive
payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent plus any payment obligations
pursuant to _Section 7.4(c)_ , the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee from
Parent and any such other obligations (if received) shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages and not a penalty, and Parent shall not have any other
liability or obligation to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the failure of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby to be consummated, and in such event, the
Company shall not seek to recover any money damages or obtain any equitable
relief from Parent or any of its Affiliates. Nothing contained herein shall
affect Parent's obligation to pay to the Company any Financing
Cooperation Expenses.

  



  

(b)  _Parent Termination Fee Payment Procedures_. Payment of the Parent
Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the
account designated by the Company within two Business Days after termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_.

  



  

(c)  _Costs of Recovery_. Each of the parties acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.4_  are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement.

this  _Section 7.4_ or the Financing Cooperation Expenses and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Parent for the amounts (or any portion thereof) set forth in this
_Section 7.4_ , Parent shall pay to the Company its documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
due from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement and without limiting the Company's remedies
under  _Section 8.7_ , the parties agree that the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee by the Parent, together with any amounts owed pursuant to
_Section 5.6_ or this _Section 7.4(c)_ , shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the
enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue
of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise) available to the
Company against the Parent for all losses and damages suffered as a result of
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Fee Letter (and the
termination thereof) to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise in the event the Parent Termination Fee becomes due
and payable, and, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any
amounts owed pursuant to _Section 5.6_ and this _Section 7.4(c)_ and under
the letter of even date hereof between Parent, the Company and Merger Sub,
the Parent shall have no further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination upon payment of such amount. In addition, without modifying or
qualifying in any way the preceding sentence or implying any intent contrary
thereto, the Company hereby waives any rights or claims against the Debt
Financing Sources and hereby agrees that in no event shall the Debt
Financing Sources have any liability or obligation to the Company and in no
event shall the Company seek or obtain any other damages of any kind against
any Debt Financing Source (including consequently, special, indirect or
punitive damages), in each case, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Financing Commitments or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is granted and the Debt

refusing or delaying the registration of a transfer where it reasonably

registration of a transfer, the Company shall, as soon as practicable, send

to a share in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any
Member may be registered as a Member upon such evidence being produced as may
reasonably be required by the Board. An application by any such person to be

the share of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Member and the Board shall
treat it as such.

   | 13.3.| Any person who has become entitled to a share or shares in
consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Member may,
