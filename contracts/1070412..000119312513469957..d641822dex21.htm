Stock_ ");

WHEREAS, the Company, the Subsidiaries and certain Affiliates thereof are

Statement.

(c)  _Disputes_. Subject to clause (i) of this _Section 2.06(c)_, the
Closing Statement delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

 

(i) The Seller may dispute any amounts reflected on the Closing Statement to
the extent the net effect of such disputed amounts in the aggregate would
affect the Net Working Capital reflected on the Closing Statement, but only on
the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing Statement were not arrived
at in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Estimated Closing
Statement or were arrived at based on mathematical or clerical error;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall have notified the Purchaser in
writing of each disputed item, specifying the estimated amount thereof in
dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute,
within thirty (30) Business Days of the Purchasers delivery of the Closing
Statement to the Seller. In the event of such a dispute, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by
them as to any disputed amounts shall be

 



19  final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the Seller and the
Purchaser are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within thirty (30)
Business Days after the receipt by the Purchaser of the Sellerss written
notice of dispute, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit the items
remaining in dispute for resolution to PricewaterhouseCooopers LLP (or, if
such firm shall decline or is unable to act or is not, at the time of such
submission, independent of the Seller and the Purchaser, to another
independent accounting firm of international reputation mutually acceptable to
the Seller and the Purchaser) (either PricewaterhouseCooopers LLP or such
other accounting firm being referred to herein as the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "), which shall, within sixty (60) Business Days after such
submission, determine and report to the Seller and the Purchaser upon such
remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Seller and the Purchaser. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Seller and the
Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted.

(ii) In acting under this Agreement the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

(d) _Determination of Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Closing Statement and
the calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Adjustment Effective Time
included therein shall be deemed final for the purposes of this _Section
2.06(d)_ upon the earliest of (x) the failure of the Seller to notify
the Purchaser of a dispute within thirty (30) Business Days of the
Purchasers delivery of the Closing Statement to the Seller, (y) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to _Section 2.06(c)(i)_, by the Seller
and the Purchaser and (z) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
_Section 2.06(c)(i)_, by the Independent Accounting Firm. The amount of the
Net Working Capital as of the Adjustment Effective Time as finally determined
shall be called the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ". Within three (3)
Business Days of the Closing Statement being deemed final, a Purchase Price
adjustment shall be made as follows:

 

(i) In the event that the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Net
Working Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in an
amount equal to such excess and the Seller shall pay the amount of such excess
to the Purchaser by wire transfer in immediately available funds.

 

(ii) In the event that the Final Net Working Capital reflected on the Closing
Statement exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, then the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal to such excess and the Purchaser
shall pay the amount of such excess to the Seller by wire transfer in
immediately available funds.

 

Section 2.07. _Withholding Taxes_. The Purchaser and the Company shall be
entitled (upon commercially reasonable notice to the Seller) to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under any provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States Tax Law or
under any applicable legal requirement. The Purchaser shall timely pay, or
cause to be paid, such Tax to the applicable Governmental Authority and, as
soon as reasonably practical, deliver to the Seller the original or a copy of
any receipt issued by such Governmental Authority (or other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Seller) evidencing such payment. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



20 Section 2.08. _Transferred Accounts Receivables; Post-Closing True-Up_. No
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser a schedule (the " _Transferred Accounts Receivables
Report_ ") setting forth certain accounts receivable related to the
Transferred Business that would otherwise be Seller Accounts Receivable (as
determined pursuant to _Section 5.12_ without application of this _Section
2.08_) that remain uncollected as of the date of the Closing Transferred
Receivables Report (the " _Transferred Accounts Receivables_ ") in an amount
not be less than Forty-Five Million Dollars ($45,000,000) (the " _Transferred
Accounts Receivables Target_ "). The Transferred Accounts Receivables Report
shall include information identifying the Transferred Accounts Receivable in
reasonable detail so as to be able to specifically identify the payor, payee
and invoice number. To the extent not in possession of the Company as of the
Closing, the Seller shall provide reasonable documentation related to the
Transferred Accounts Receivables as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.12(c)_, to
the extent that any of the Transferred Accounts Receivables are paid (or any
portion thereof) to the Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the delivery
of the Collected Accounts Receivable Report, the Seller shall pay to the
Purchaser within two (2) Business Days following the payment thereof to the
Seller or any of its Affiliates and upon payment shall identify the
Transferred Accounts Receivable to which the payment relates. On or after the
forty-fifth (45th) day following the Closing, the Purchaser may provide to
the Seller a schedule (the " _Collected Accounts Receivables Report_ ") of the
Transferred Accounts Receivables (or the portion thereof) that have been
received by the Purchaser from the Seller or any of its Affiliates
as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence without set-off,
counterclaim or discount by the date of the Collected Accounts Receivables
Report, which shall include in reasonable detail the amount (including partial
amounts) of such receivables received by such date (the " _Collected Accounts
Receivable_ "). Any accounts receivable that are clearly identifiable based
upon payment instructions from the payor as Transferred Accounts Receivable
(including by reference to an invoice for payment) and are otherwise paid
directly to the Company or its Subsidiaries by the payor thereof shall be
deemed to be Collected Accounts Receivables. Within three (3) Business Days
following receipt of the Collected Accounts Receivables Report, the Seller
will pay to the Purchaser in immediately available funds an amount equal to
(x) the amount of the Transferred Accounts Receivables Target _minus_ (y) the
aggregate amount of the Collected Accounts Receivable.

Section 2.09. _Tetrick Lease_. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Tetrick Lease, and any assignment of interests under the Overriding Royalty
Agreement and the Second Overriding Royalty Agreement, at the Closing, the
Seller shall assign, or cause to be assigned, all of its and its subsidiaries
rights in and under the Tetrick Lease to Parent or any subsidiary of Parent,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries designated in writing by Parent prior
to the Closing.

Adverse Effect. True and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation

Tax Return, entered into any closing agreement, settled any Tax claim or
assessment or surrendered any right to claim a refund of Taxes, if such
election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement or surrender
would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period ending after the Closing
Date or materially decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries existing on the Closing Date.

to which it is a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
Purchaser is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction which the properties owned or leased by it or the
operation of its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except to the extent that the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
standing would not adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser to carry out
its obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The execution and delivery by the
Purchaser of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party, the performance by the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of the Purchaser. This Agreement has been,
and upon their execution the Ancillary Agreements to which the Purchaser is a
party shall have been, duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser, and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Seller) this
Agreement constitutes, and upon their execution the Ancillary Agreements to
which the Purchaser is a party shall constitute, legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance
with their respective terms.

 

Section 4.02. _No Conflict_. Assuming compliance with the pre-merger
notification and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act and the making
and obtaining of all filings, notifications, consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions referred to in _Section 4.03_, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party do not and will not (a) violate,
conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the

termination, amendment, acceleration, suspension, revocation or cancellation
of, any Contract to which the Purchaser is a party, except, in the case of
clauses (b) and (c), as would not materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Purchaser to carry out its obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 4.03. _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement and each Ancillary

consent, approval, authorization or other order of, action by, filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (a) the pre-
merger notification and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act or (b)
where failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to
make such filing or notification, would not prevent or materially delay the
consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



32 Section 4.04. _Investment Purpose_. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares
solely for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for offer or

Purchaser agrees that the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration
under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, except
pursuant to an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and
such laws. The Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of holding the
Shares for an indefinite period (including total loss of its investment), and
(either alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risk of their investment.

 

Section 4.05. _Financing_. The Purchaser has provided the Seller a true,
complete and correct copy of an executed debt financing commitment letter and
corresponding customarily redacted fee letter (none of which redacted terms
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount or availability of
the Debt Financing) from the financial institutions identified therein (as
may be amended or replaced from time to time) (the " _Debt Financing
Commitment_ "), to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein,
interim financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding
the Purchase Price (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_
"). The Debt Financing Commitment is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, the other parties thereto, in
each case subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws affecting generally the enforcement of creditors
rights and subject to general principles of equity. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and has not been
withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser,
any of the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment, or a failure of the
conditions to the Debt Financing. The net proceeds from the Debt
Financing, together with cash on hand, will be sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has paid in full any and all
commitment or other fees required by the Debt Financing Commitment that are
due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such fees
as they become due. The Debt Financing Commitment is not subject to any
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the
full amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent other than as set forth
therein (including the payment of customary fees). There are no side letters
or other agreements (except for any customary engagement letter, a true and
complete copy of which has been provided to the Seller, with only the fee
amounts and certain other terms (none of which would reduce the aggregate
principal amount or affect the conditionality of the Debt Financing) redacted)
relating to the Debt Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a
party other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. The
Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby are not contingent on financing, regardless of
whether the Debt Financing or any replacement thereof, is available to Parent
at the Closing.

the Purchaser is pending or, to the best knowledge of the Purchaser,
threatened, which, if adversely determined, could affect the legality,
validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 4.07. _Brokers_. Except for Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the

 



33  transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
payment of the fees and expenses of Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Section 4.08. _Independent Investigation; Seller s Representations_. The
Purchaser has conducted its own independent investigation, review and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects of the Transferred Business,
which investigation, review and analysis was done by the Purchaser and its
Affiliates and representatives. The Purchaser acknowledges that it and its
representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel,
properties, premises and records of the Transferred Business for
such purpose. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser acknowledges
that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and
analysis and has not relied on any factual representations, statement or
opinions of the Seller or its representatives (except the specific
representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement and
the schedules thereto or in any certificates or other instruments delivered
pursuant hereto (including for the avoidance of doubt the Ancillary
Agreements)), including factual representations or opinions stated by the
Seller or its representatives, including any personnel of the Seller, the
Company or any Subsidiary during the course of the independent investigation
whether given orally or in writing. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and
agrees that (a) other than the representations and warranties made in this
Agreement (including for the avoidance of doubt the Ancillary Agreements) and
in any certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, none of
the Seller, its Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or representatives make or have made and the Purchaser has not and

the Assets or the Transferred Business, including as to (i) merchantability or
fitness for any particular use or purpose, (ii) the operation of the
Transferred Business by the Purchaser after the Closing in any manner other
than as used and operated by the Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries or
(iii) the probable success or profitability of the Transferred Business after
the Closing and (b) other than the indemnification obligations of the Seller
set forth in _Article VII_ and _Article IX_ (or otherwise expressly provided
herein), none of the Seller, its Affiliates, or any of their respective

any liability or indemnification obligation to the Purchaser or to any other
Person resulting from the distribution to the Purchaser, its Affiliates
or representatives of, or the Purchasers use of, any information relating to
the Transferred Business and any information, documents or material made
available to the Purchaser, whether orally or in writing, in certain "data
rooms," management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser or in any other
form during the independent investigation or otherwise in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for the representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any certificates or other
instruments delivered pursuant hereto (including for the avoidance of doubt

respective subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or representatives make or have made any representation
or warranty, whether express or implied.

(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between the Seller and Parent are
hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of Parent (and its Affiliates, including the Purchaser) under
this _Section 5.03_ shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not terminate with respect to that portion of
the Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) not exclusively relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect.

 

(b) Nothing provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)_ shall in
any way amend or diminish the Purchasers obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any
Confidential Information provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
5.02(a)_ or otherwise by the Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary or
any officer, director, employee, agent, representative, accountant or counsel
thereof shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in
any of the other Ancillary Agreements, following the Closing, (i) all
confidential information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date of the Closing will constitute confidential information of the
Purchaser, irrespective of whether such confidential information was
identified or otherwise designated as "confidential"; (ii) the Purchaser will
have no obligations whatsoever under the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect to such confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and (iii) with respect to such confidential information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Seller and its Affiliates will hold, and will take
reasonable measures to cause their respective officers, counsel,
advisors, employees and any other representatives to hold, such confidential
information in confidence, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement as
if they were a party to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



37 (c) At the Closing, in the event that consent to assignment is not required
under the terms of any nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement entered
into with any potential acquirer in connection with the possible sale,
directly or indirectly, of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Transferred
Business (the " _Third Party Confidentiality Agreements_ "), the Seller shall
assign to the Purchaser in whole or in part all rights under any such Third
Party Confidentiality Agreements. For any such Third Party Confidentiality
Agreements that are not assignable pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Seller shall make the Purchaser reasonably aware of the terms
thereof and if requested by the Purchaser in writing, the Seller shall enforce
for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries any such nondisclosure
and confidentiality agreement as directed by the Purchaser; _provided_ that
the Purchaser shall pay for all costs and expenses related to such enforcement
of such agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto (and
its representatives, agents and employees) may consult any tax advisor
regarding the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and may disclose to any person, without limitation of any kind, the
tax treatment and tax structure of such transactions and all materials
(including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided relating to
such treatment or structure.

Section 5.04. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to
promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate fully in
promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals. Each party hereto agrees to make promptly its respective filing, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. The Seller shall not be
required to pay any fees or other payments to any Governmental Authorities in
order to obtain any such authorization, consent, order or approval (other than
normal filing fees that are imposed by Law on the Seller). Without limiting
the generality of the Purchasers undertaking pursuant to this _Section
5.04(a)_, the Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take any
and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto
to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby no later than the
Termination Date. In addition, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts
to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing by the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the Purchaser be obligated to agree to, or proffer to, divest or
hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect
to, or agree to any controls on their operation of, any material assets
(whether tangible or intangible) or any material portion of any business of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. Neither party to this Agreement
shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate

 



38  at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to
this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) The parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to submit and, as
applicable, cause their respective subsidiaries to submit within twenty (20)
Business Days after the Closing, transfer applications to the relevant
Governmental Authorities, and shall thereafter take all other necessary
actions to cause any (i) Permits owned by the Company or any Subsidiary that
pertain to the Excluded Business to be transferred to the Seller or its
designee as expeditiously as possible, and (ii) Permits that pertain to the
Transferred Business that prior to the Closing are owned by a Transferring
Entity to be transferred to the Company or any Subsidiary as expeditiously as
possible (the Permits referenced in sub clauses (i) and (ii) are referred to
herein as the " _Affected Permits_ "). Until the Affected Permits are
transferred to the Seller or its designee or to the Company or any Subsidiary,
as applicable (each, a " _Permit Transferee_ "), the Seller or its designee
shall mine the coal on any Real Property subject to the Affected Permits (the
" _Affected Real Property_ ") and each Permit Transferee will operate the
Transferred Business or Excluded Business subject to, and in accordance with,
any Affected Permit (the " _Affected Business_ ") as an "operator" pursuant
to _Section 5.04(d)_. If any Affected Permit is not transferred to the Permit
Transferee at least 120 days prior to the expiration date of such Affected
Permit, the Permit Transferee may, at the Permit Transferees sole cost and
expense (including any guarantee or other similar credit support that such
Permit Transferor may reasonably require to backstop any guarantee or other
similar credit support provided by such Permitted Transferor), require the
transferor of any such Affected Permit (the " _Permit Transferor_ ") to
expeditiously submit, or cause any subsidiary thereof to submit, renewal
applications for such Affected Permit, including any required increase in
bonds relating to such Affected Permits. If the Permit Transferee exercises
this right, the Permit Transferor shall, at the Permit Transferees sole cost
and expense, timely submit, and as required shall cause any subsidiary
thereof to submit, minor permit modifications and amendments as requested by
the Permit Transferee from time to time, and shall otherwise cooperate in good
faith with the Permit Transferee to undertake and to accomplish the
permitting and related activities described on _Section 5.04(c)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule. Upon issuance of the Affected Permit renewals, the Permit
Transferor shall, and shall cause any applicable subsidiary to, proceed to
apply for the transfer of the Affected Permits to the Permit Transferee, and
shall complete the transfer of the Affected Permit as soon as possible.

(d) For as long as the Permit Transferee or any designee thereof operates the
Affected Business on any Affected Real Property as the designated "operator"
on behalf of the Permit Transferor under each Affected Permit pursuant to the

Liability of the Permit Transferee (and shall be deemed to be an "Excluded
Liability" hereunder) and shall be cured by the Permit Transferee as soon as
reasonably practicable. The Permit Transferor shall have the right to enter
on any Real Property subject to the Affected Permits (and to the extent

Company or any Subsidiary, then, at the request of the Seller, such asset or
property shall be promptly transferred, assigned and conveyed to, or as
directed by the Seller. Until such asset or property is transferred,

complete any incomplete portion of, such draft Confidential Information
Memorandum, including any corrections with respect to the Required

rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT ACT, Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001), and (vi) using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP (" _E andY_") to provide
customary accountants comfort letters (which shall provide "negative

Seller; _provided_ that the effectiveness of any documentation executed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect thereto (other than any
certificate or letter required by EandY in order to deliver a comfort letter or
consent in connection with an offering of debt securities) shall be subject to
the consummation of the Closing. Nothing herein shall require any cooperation
by the Company or the Seller to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Seller or its Affiliates (including,
prior to Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries). The Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that (a) except with respect to a breach of its obligations under
this _Section 5.10_, neither the Seller nor the Company nor any of their
respective Affiliates, subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,

advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action to
solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person
(other than Purchaser and/or its Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of
the Companys equity securities or the Assets or any merger, sale
of substantial assets or similar transaction involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the Assets, other than assets (other than equity interests)

Section 5.12. _Accounts Receivable_.

 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that, except for the Transferred Accounts
Receivables (for which payment to the Purchaser shall be made as contemplated
by _Section 2.08_), all accounts receivable of the Transferred Business in
respect solely of sales of Coal Inventory, title of which is transferred to
buyers thereof at or prior to the Closing, shall remain the property of
the Seller from and after the Closing (the " _Seller Accounts Receivable_ ")
and the Purchaser shall not acquire any beneficial right or interest therein.

 



43 (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled as of the Closing to
all accounts receivable of the Transferred Business other than the Seller
Accounts Receivable (the " _Purchaser Accounts Receivable_ ").

 

(c) For purposes of determining the allocation of any payment received by the
Purchaser or the Seller on or after the Closing Date from any Person that
owes amounts in respect of both Seller Accounts Receivable and Purchaser

shall be applied as directed by such Person, if direction is provided

of such direction, funds shall be applied to accounts receivable in the order
of oldest to newest. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to make payments to
each other on a regular basis in respect of amounts received by them on and
after the Closing Date with respect to any Seller Accounts Receivable and
Purchaser Accounts Receivable to give effect to the allocation set forth in
this _Section 5.12(c)_. Nothing in this _Section 5.12(c)_ shall be deemed
to amend, modify or in any way alter the Sellers obligations under _Section
2.08_.

 

(d) The Purchaser and the Seller shall provide to each other access to files,
records and books of account for the purpose of verifying any funds that have
been remitted to each to verify collection and disposition of the proceeds of

Ancillary Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act or transaction involving the Transferred Business, the other
party will (and will cause its respective Affiliates and subsidiaries to)
cooperate with the contesting or defending party and its counsel in the
contest or defense, make available its personnel and provide such testimony
and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending party (unless the contesting or defending Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor pursuant to _Article IX_ );  _provided_
, _however_ , that, for avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not require
any party to take any such action if (w) the interests of the parties in, or
with respect to, such Action shall be directly adverse, (x) it may result in
a waiver or breach of any attorney/client privilege, (y) it could reasonably
be expected to result in violation of applicable Law, or (z) providing such
access or information would be reasonably expected to be
unreasonably disruptive to its operations.

related to the Transferred Business that is covered by a Seller Insurance

occurrence date on or prior to the Closing Date related to the Transferred
Business for which any portion of the post-Closing economic loss is covered by

Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, submit a claim and assert
its rights under such Seller Insurance Policy and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to recover fully any and all amounts available under such Seller
Insurance Policy with respect to any such loss (the " _Insurance Proceeds_ ");

Section 5.14. _Contract Consents_.

 

(a) _Transaction Consents; Seller Required Consents_. Without limiting the
Sellers obligations set forth in  _Section 5.04_, the Seller shall use its
best efforts to obtain (i) prior to the Closing and as necessary following the
Closing, all the consents, approvals or waivers from third parties ("
_Consents_ ") set forth on  _Section 8.01(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Seller Required Consents_ ") and _Section 8.02(d)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule so as to enable the parties hereto to expeditiously close the
transactions contemplated hereby no later than the Termination Date, (ii) (A)

Transaction Consents (other than immaterial Transaction Consents) and (B)
solely following the Closing, immaterial Transaction Consents, in each case
so that none of the effects set forth in _Section 3.04(c)_ have occurred or
will occur as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements by the Seller or any of its
subsidiaries or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(disregarding any qualification or limitation based on materiality, including
the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar materiality
or similar qualification or limitation set forth in _Section 3.04(c)_), or,
in the case of clause (i) or (ii) above, shall provide for alternative
arrangements in lieu of each such Consent that is acceptable to the
Purchaser. A " _Transaction Consent_ " shall mean all Consents set forth on or
contemplated by, or that are or would be required to be set forth on or
contemplated by, _Section 3.04(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, determined by
disregarding any qualification or limitation based on materiality, including
the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar materiality
or similar qualification or limitation, set forth in _Section 3.04(c)_,
including for the purpose of determining any of the effects set forth in
_Section 3.04(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 5.14(a)_, the Seller and the Purchaser shall each equally share the
cost of all Consent Payment Amounts necessary to obtain any Seller Required
Consents; provided that neither the Seller nor the Purchaser shall be required
to agree to pay an aggregate amount of Consent Payment Amounts arising from
obtaining the Seller Required Consents in excess of $5,000,000 each (for a
total of $10,000,000 of such Consent Payment Amounts for the Seller and the
Purchaser) and the Purchaser shall not be required to pay such Consent
Payment Amount until the Closing. The parties hereto understand and
acknowledge that nothing in this _Section 5.14(a)_ shall be deemed to
constitute or result in a waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth
in  _Section 8.01(e)_ or _Section 8.02(d)_.

 



45 (b) _Replacement of Seller s Guarantees and Shared Party Contracts_. Without
limiting the Sellers obligations set forth in _Section 5.04_ or the effect
of any Seller Required Consent as provided in _Section 5.14(a)_, prior to the
Closing, and as necessary, following the Closing, upon request of the
Seller, Parent shall offer to replace any guarantees provided by the Seller
or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) of
any Contract of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries exclusively related to
the Transferred Business to which the Seller or any of its subsidiaries
(other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) also is or would be a party as
of the Closing (after giving effect to the Reorganization) (any of the
foregoing Contracts, a " _Shared Party Contract_ ") with a guarantee of
Parent that (w) is on customary terms and conditions, (x) solely relates to
the operations of the Transferred Business from and after the Closing, (y)
will not adversely affect the Debt Financing or any other obligations of
Parent or the Purchaser and (z) shall not be effective prior to the Closing.
If Parent shall not replace any such guarantee, from and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its subsidiaries (for avoidance of
doubt, not including the Company and the Subsidiaries) from any Loss or
obligation under a Shared Party Contract for events arising from and after the
Closing (other than as a result of the actions or activities of Parent
contributing to such Loss or obligation).

(c) _Multi-Use Contracts_. As of the date hereof, the Seller and/or one or
more of its subsidiaries (including the Company and/or one or more of the
Subsidiaries) are party to Contracts relating to both the Transferred Business
and an Excluded Business (each, a " _Multi-Use Contract_ "). Without limiting
the Sellers obligations set forth in _Section 5.04_, prior to the Closing,
and as necessary, following the Closing, the Seller shall (i) use its best
efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, all Consents of the third
party counterparties to the Multi-Use Contracts to separate the Multi-Use
Contracts so that the Company or one of the Subsidiaries (but not the Seller
or any of its other subsidiaries) is party to the portion of the Multi-Use
Contract related to the Transferred Business and the Seller or one of its
subsidiaries other than the Company or the Subsidiaries (but not the Company
or the Subsidiaries) is party to the portion of the Multi-Use Contract related
to the Excluded Business, which Consent may include any Consent (including
any Consent to any partial assignment of the Multi-Use Contract from or to the
Company or Seller), making arrangements with the counterparty for shared use
of the Multi-Use Contract, causing entry into one or more separate or amended
Contract(s) with the counterparty or other similar arrangement (any of which
shall be deemed a Consent hereunder), and (ii) in the absence of such Consent
being obtained, provide for the benefit of the Transferred Businesses receipt
of services or products or rights from and after the Closing that at or prior
to the Closing (prior to giving effect to the Reorganization) were received
from any third party counterparty under any Multi-Use Contract related to
the Transferred Business pursuant to a Multi-Use Contract (any arrangement
contemplated by clause (a) or (b), a " _Reorganization Arrangement_ "). The
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company or Subsidiary to, reasonably
cooperate at the Sellers sole cost and expense (and without limiting the
meaning of clause (i) of the definition of "Excluded Liabilities") to provide
for the benefit of the Excluded Business receipt of services or products or
rights from and after the Closing that were received by the Excluded Business
under a Multi-Use Contract. If the Seller shall provide the benefits of a
Multi-Use Contract pursuant to clause (ii) above, from and after the Closing,
(A) the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties against any Losses incurred by such party as a result of the Sellers
or any of its subsidiaries performance or failure to perform its obligations
under that portion of the Multi-Use Contract applicable to its or their
business after the Closing and (B) if the Seller has complied with _Section
5.14(e)_ with respect to the arrangement of the provision of services, the
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties
against any Losses incurred by such party as a result of the Companys or any
of the Subsidiaries performance or failure to perform its obligations under
that portion of the Multi-Use Contract applicable to its or their business
after the Closing.

(d) _Cooperation_. Parent and the Purchaser shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts at the Sellers sole cost and expense to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by the Seller

 



46  in connection with the receipt of the Consents and the Reorganization
Arrangements, including (i) participation in meetings with parties to
Contracts; and (ii) providing the Seller with information required by parties
to Contracts and as reasonably requested by the Seller with respect to Parent
or the Purchaser; _provided_ that (x) the effectiveness of any instruments
executed by Parent or the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries with respect
thereto shall be subject to the consummation of the Closing and (y) nothing
herein shall require any cooperation by Parent or the Purchaser to the extent
it would unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Parent,
the Purchaser or the Company or their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(e) _Modification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any Consents or obtaining or
entering into any Reorganization Arrangements, neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, for purposes of this 
_Section 5.14_, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall, without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (i) consent to or effect any modification of,
or amendment to, applicable terms of any Contract (including, for avoidance
of doubt, any Multi-Use Contract), (ii) otherwise obligate Parent, the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or subsidiaries
to take or omit to take any action, or (iii) agree to the grant of, or accept,
any Consent or Reorganization Arrangement that is subject to any restrictions
or other requirements, with respect to any of clause (i), (ii) or (iii), that
could adversely affect the terms of the applicable Contract (economic or
otherwise) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the value of the
Transferred Business or the Assets. Any economic effect of any such
modification, modification or amendment shall be a Consent Payment Amount.

 

(f) _Consent Payment Amounts_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
_Section 5.14(a)_ with respect to Consent Payment Amounts to obtain the
Seller Required Consents, the Seller shall bear the full cost of all Consent
Payment Amounts, and the Seller shall be responsible for, and shall reimburse
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or
Affiliates for, all Consent Payment Amounts incurred or paid by any such
Person at the request or approval of Seller, as incurred.

 

Section 5.15. _Business Financial Statements_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than the
deadlines specified in clause (c) of this  _Section 5.15_), the Seller shall
(i) prepare and provide, or cause to be prepared and provided, to the
Purchaser, at the Purchasers sole cost and expense, which costs and expenses
shall be reasonable and customary, any and all balance sheets, statements of
income, cash flows and stockholders equity for the Transferred Business in
accordance with GAAP and as required by Regulation S-X for the following
periods, and together with all footnotes required by GAAP, as of and for (A)
the year ended December 31, 2012 which shall be audited by EandY and (B) the
nine month period ended September 30, 2013, which shall be audited by EandY (the
" _Interim Financial Statements_ "), which financial statements shall be
prepared in a manner meeting the requirements of GAAP (for avoidance of doubt,
the financial statements will reflect Intercompany Receivable/Payables as
contribution/distributions in the Equity section of the balance sheet, and
the footnotes to financial statements will adequately describe the inclusion
of such accounts); and (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to assist EandY
in the completion of an audit of the financial statements and, including
executing such management and other representation letters as shall be
requested by EandY, so that EandY is able to complete its audit of the financial
statements. The Seller shall also cause EandY to deliver one or more customary
"comfort letters" as reasonably requested by the Purchaser and its financing
sources.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, if the Closing occurs after
December 30, 2013, in lieu of the Interim Financial Statements (defined as
September 30, 2013), GAAP financial statements (audited by EandY) for 2013
prepared in the manner contemplated in clause (a) above for the year ended
2012 shall be delivered no later than the deadline specified in clause (c) of
this _Section 5.15_.

 



47 (c) If the Closing occurs on or prior to December 30, 2013, the financial
statements required by clause (a) of this _Section 5.15_ shall be delivered
on or prior to February 1, 2014. If the Closing occurs after December 30,
2013, the financial statements required by clause (b) of this  _Section
5.15_ shall be delivered on or prior to seventy (70) days following the
Closing.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing (but in no event
later than the deadline required for the financial statements required by
clause (a) or (b) of this _Section 5.15_, as applicable), the Seller shall
prepare and provide financial statements for the period beginning on the
first day of the fiscal quarter in which the Closing occurs and ending on the
date of the Closing, prepared in accordance with GAAP and, subject to the next
sentence, otherwise on a basis substantially consistent with the financial
statements contemplated by clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section 5.15_;
_provided_ , _however_ that no such financial statements will be required if
the Closing occurs on December 31, 2013. Any such financial statements
required to be prepared and provided in accordance with the foregoing need not
be audited or reviewed by EandY or any other accounting firm, unless the Closing
occurs on March 31, 2014, in which case such financial statements shall be
reviewed by EandY, and the Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
assist EandY in the completion of a review of such financial statements.

Section 5.16. _Subsidiaries and Affiliates Compliance_. Without limiting the
obligations of the parties otherwise expressly set forth herein, each of the
parties hereto will take all action necessary to cause its subsidiaries to
perform their obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

ARTICLE VI

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 6.01. _Collective Bargaining Agreements and Employees_. The Company
and each of the Subsidiaries that are parties to the Wage Agreement shall be
referred to as the " _Signatory Companies_." As of the Closing Date the
Signatory Companies recognize that they are signatory to the Wage Agreement
and agree that the Seller has met its obligations regarding the successorship
provisions of Article I of the Wage Agreement. Twin Rivers Towing Inc. has a
labor agreement with the Seafarers International Union and recognizes the
obligations to its employees contained therein. Within three (3) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement, the Seller shall provide a complete and
accurate written list of all of the union employees employed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (" _Union Employees
List_ ") and shall include accrued vacation and holiday pay (which may be
provided no later than five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement),
active or leave status, and seniority. Prior to the Closing and other than as
occurring in the ordinary course of business, the Seller shall neither, and
shall cause its subsidiaries neither to, hire and/or terminate any union
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor transfer the
employment or service of any union employee to or from the Company or any of
the its Subsidiaries (other than solely between the Company and the
Subsidiaries). In accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the Union
Employees List will be updated by the Seller and provided to the Purchaser
at reasonable intervals through the Closing Date as changes are made in the
ordinary course, along with accrued vacation and holiday pay, active or leave
status, and seniority.

 

Section 6.02. _Pension Withdrawal Liability_. The Purchaser agrees that the
Signatory Companies will for periods on and after the Closing Date continue
to contribute to the 1974 UMWA

 



48  Pension Plan in accordance with the terms of the Wage Agreement. In the
event that the Signatory Companies withdraw from the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan at
any time on or after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Signatory
Companies will be solely responsible for satisfaction of any withdrawal
liability due to the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan pursuant to ERISA and for timely
making any and all periodic or other payments required by law;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this does not relieve or waive any obligations of the Seller
under its representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or any
breach by the Seller thereof. The Purchaser represents and warrants that the
value of the assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement together with the
value of other assets of the Purchaser will allow the Purchaser to satisfy the
currently estimated withdrawal liability under the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan of
the Signatory Companies. The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller against any and all claims that may be asserted by the 1974 UMWA
Pension Plan for payment of withdrawal liability with respect to the Signatory
Companies except to the extent the claims arise, occur or result in full or
part from a breach by the Seller of any representations, warranties or
covenants in this Agreement.

 

The Purchaser shall provide notice to the Seller of (i) any complete or
partial withdrawal from the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan by the Purchaser that
takes place after the Closing Date and on or prior to December 31, 2023 and
(ii) any resulting assessment of withdrawal liability and request or demand
for withdrawal liability payments by the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan received by
the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall pay or cause the Signatory Companies to pay
each installment of withdrawal liability applicable to the Signatory Companies
on or after the Closing Date prior to the due date of each such payment and
shall provide the Seller with notice of each installment payment; _provided_
, _however_ , this does not relieve or waive any obligations of the Seller
under its representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or any
breach by the Seller thereof. In the event of any breach by the Purchaser of
any of its obligations under this _Section 6.02_, the Seller shall have the
right to seek injunctive relief or to take any action necessary to prevent or
cure any actual or threatened default by the Purchaser.

Section 6.03. _Other Employment-Related Liabilities_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries will, and on and after the Closing Date the Purchaser will cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay off, satisfy and discharge all
Employee and Retiree Liabilities as they become due and payable. As set forth
in the TSA, the Seller shall maintain certain Plans to provide specific
Employee and Retiree Liabilities for the length of time contained therein, at
the expense of the Purchaser. Prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing, the Purchaser and Parent shall comply with all covenants restricting
dividends or other similar distributions from any such Person to any other
Person (other than any of its Subsidiaries) as set forth in any credit
agreement to which they are party, as such credit agreement may be in effect
from time to time. The obligations of the Purchaser, the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.03_ do not relieve or waive any
obligations of the Seller under its representations, warranties and covenants
in this Agreement or any breach by the Seller thereof.

Section 6.04. _Salaried and Hourly Non-Union Employees and Employee
Benefits_. Except as provided in the MSEEBA:

(a) The Purchaser shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to continue the employment of each of the non-union employees employed by the
Company or such Subsidiary as of the Closing Date (" _Business Employees_ "),
for which a complete and accurate list has provided to the Purchaser by the
Seller in writing at least one (1) day prior to the date of this Agreement ("
_Business Employees List_ "). Prior to the Closing and other than as occurring
in the ordinary course of business, with respect to the Seller Retained
Employees or with the Purchasers prior written consent, the Seller shall not,
and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, hire and/or terminate employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or transfer the employment or service
of any employees to or from the Company or any of the its Subsidiaries (other
than solely between the Company and the Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_
, that with respect to any employees listed on the Business Employee List not
currently employed

 



49  by the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Seller agrees to take all actions
necessary to transfer the employment of such employees to the Company or its
Subsidiaries so that they are employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as
of the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to transfer the employment and service as
employees of the Seller Retained Employees out of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Seller or its Affiliates. In accordance with the
provisions of this paragraph, the Business Employees List will be updated by
the Seller and provided to the Purchaser at reasonable intervals through the
Closing Date as changes are made in the ordinary course, along with accrued
vacation and holiday pay (which shall be included after the date of this
Agreement), active or leave status, seniority, whether exempt or not under the
Fair Labor Standards Act, and salary or wage and target bonus if any. The
Seller has provided a complete and accurate list of the following applicable
to each Business Employee: accrued vacation and holiday pay (which shall be
included after the date of this Agreement), active or leave status,
seniority, any collective bargaining agreement that applies, whether exempt or
not under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and, if not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, salary or wage and target bonus if any. Individuals
whose employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries continues after
the Closing Date in accordance with this _Section 6.04(a)_ are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Retained Employees_." Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, the Seller shall be responsible for all
obligations, if any, to Retained Employees with respect to performance bonuses
earned by the Retained Employees for any period of the 2013 and/or 2014
calendar year. Nothing in this  _Section 6.04_ shall obligate the Purchaser,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any such
Retained Employee and any other employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any specific period (it being understood that the Purchaser
shall be obligated to pay severance benefits pursuant to _Section 6.04(c)_
herein to the extent due).

 

(b) The Purchaser shall give, or shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries
to give, each Retained Employee credit under the applicable Purchasers Plans
that cover such employee, including any vacation, sick leave and severance
policies, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation,
sick leave and severance benefits (excluding accrual of benefits under
any defined benefit pension plan) for the Retained Employees service with
the Seller or the Signatory Companies and their Affiliates, as applicable,
prior to the Closing Date, to the extent credited by the Seller for the same
purpose under an analogous Plan and provided no duplication of benefits
results. Except as set forth on _Section 6.04(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules, no portion of the assets of any trust or other fund maintained by
the Seller for the purpose of paying benefits under any of the Plans will be
transferred to the Purchaser, or the Purchasers Plans. For purposes of this
Agreement " _Purchaser s Plans_" means all employee benefit plans (as defined
in Section 3(3) of the ERISA and all retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, disability, severance or other benefit plans,
programs or arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other
contracts or agreements, to which the Purchaser is a party or to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries will, after the Closing, be made a party, with
respect to which the Purchaser has and the Company or its Subsidiaries will
have after the Closing, any obligation or which are maintained, contributed
to or sponsored by the Purchaser and/or, after the Closing, by the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

(c) Except as set forth in the collective bargaining agreement with the UMWA,
if any Retained Employee is involuntarily terminated without cause by the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary within three (3) months following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser will, or will cause the Company or the
Subsidiaries to, provide under the Purchasers Plans benefits that are at
least equal to the severance pay and other benefits that the employee would
have received under the corresponding Plan. For those Retained Employees that
are involuntarily terminated on or prior to December 31, 2014, and have an
employment agreement with a change of control severance pay requirement, the
Purchaser will, or will cause the Company or the Subsidiaries to,
provide severance pay in an amount at least equal to the severance pay
required by the change of control provision.

 



50 (d) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company or the Subsidiaries to,
continue to credit to each Retained Employee in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Purchasers policies regarding vacation and personal holiday
pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the
Closing Date to the extent the relevant plan, policy or arrangement is set
forth on _Schedule 3.13(a)_ and the unused vacation and personal holiday pay
is set forth on the Business Employee List, and shall assume all liability for
the payment of such amounts to the extent accrued prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to the Sellers vacation and personal holiday pay policies listed in
_Schedule 3.13(a)_.

 

(e) The Purchaser will assume the responsibility to pay short-term and long-
term disability benefits to all Retained Employees who are on disability
leave on the Closing Date under the terms of the Sellers disability plans.
The Purchasers Plans will govern the determination of what, if any, short-
term and long-term disability benefits will be paid to any Retained
Employee whose disability occurs after the Closing. If any Retained Employee
is on any form of leave of absence at the Closing (including any leave subject
to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or comparable state law), the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company or the Subsidiaries to, reinstate
such Retained Employee to active employment upon the expiration of the leave
to the extent such reinstatement is required by any applicable Law or by the
Companys or such Subsidiarys, as applicable, personnel policies and shall
satisfy any other obligation with respect to such Retained Employee during and
immediately following such leave as required under any applicable Law or the
Companys or such Subsidiarys, as applicable, personnel policies (copies of
which, as in effect at the Closing Date, have been made available to the
Purchaser) upon the expiration of such leave.

 

(f) For at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, but no longer
than their employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser
shall be required to provide Retained Employees with group medical and dental
plans as may be sponsored by the Purchaser or any replacement for such plans
for similarly situated employees. Coverage of medical and dental expenses
for Retained Employees under the Plans will end on the Closing Date. Except
for the medical coverage considered to be an Excluded Liability, for twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be required to
provide retirees (and their eligible dependents) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with medical coverage and retiree life insurance coverage
substantially similar to the medical coverage provided to these retirees by
the Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date. Responsibility for retiree
medical coverage and retiree life insurance coverage shall be the obligation
of the Transferred Business or Excluded Business where the retiree last
worked. A list of current retirees is set forth in  _Schedule 6.04(f)_.

(g) Effective as of the Closing Date and continuing on and after the Closing
Date, the Seller shall or shall cause the Sellers Plans to provide all
entitlements under Code Section 4980B, Part 6 or 7 of Title I of ERISA, or any
similar state law (collectively, " _COBRA_ ") with respect to any Plan subject
to COBRA of any Business Employee or former employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at the time of termination of employment, or any dependent or
former dependent of any such employee or former employee, whose qualifying
event occurred on or prior to the Closing Date at a time when the employee or
former employee was on the payroll of the Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries or was on COBRA coverage, including any obligations to such
individuals currently on such COBRA continuation coverage and any obligations
to any such individual whose period for electing such COBRA continuation
coverage has not yet expired.

(h) Nothing in this _Article VI_ , express or implied, shall: (i) subject to
the Wage Agreement, limit the ability of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company or any Subsidiary)
to terminate the employment of any employee (including any Retained Employee)
at any time and for any or no reason; (ii) be construed to establish, amend,
or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, policy,
contract or arrangement; (iii) limit the ability

 



51  of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
the Company or any Subsidiary) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement, policy, contract or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored, or maintained by any of them; or (iv)
confer upon any Person (including any Retained Employee) any rights as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

Section 7.01.  _Tax Indemnities_.

(a) The Seller shall indemnify and hold each Purchaser Indemnified Party
harmless against all Excluded Taxes (except to the extent that such Taxes are
reflected as a liability in the Net Working Capital). The Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold each Seller Indemnified Party harmless against all Taxes
and associated expenses (i) resulting from any act, transaction or omission
of the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary occurring on the Closing Date
after the Closing that is not in the ordinary course of business or
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) resulting from an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable
period ending on the date of the Closing shall be:

 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than
conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under _Section 7.06_),
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable (after giving effect to
amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) if the
taxable period ended on the Closing Date; and

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, or otherwise measured by the level
of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset
against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any credit or refund resulting
from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based
upon the method employed in this paragraph (b) taking into account the type of
Tax to which the refund relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or
measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles,
any amount thereof required to be allocated under this _Section 7.01(b)_
shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the date of the
Closing. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations
shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company and
the Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(c) Payment by the indemnifying party of any amount due under this _Section
7.01_ shall be made within 10 days following written notice by the
indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate taxing
authority is due, _provided_ that the indemnifying party shall not be required
to make any payment earlier than five Business Days before it is due to the
appropriate taxing

 



52  authority. If the Seller receives an assessment or other notice of Taxes due
with respect to the Company and any Subsidiary for any taxable period (or
portion of any taxable period) ending on or before the date of the Closing
for which the Seller is not otherwise responsible, in whole or in part,
pursuant to this Agreement because such Taxes are reflected as a liability in
Net Working Capital, then the Purchaser shall pay such Taxes for which the
Seller is not responsible, or if the Seller pays such Taxes, then the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary shall pay to the Seller the amount of
such Taxes for which the Seller is not responsible within 10 days following
such payment provided that the Seller shall not be required to make any
payment earlier than five Business Days before it is due to the appropriate
taxing authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with
the provisions of  _Section 9.05_, payment of the Tax to the appropriate
taxing authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by the appropriate taxing authority or
court.

 

Section 7.02. _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_.

 

(a) Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including any interest paid or
credited with respect thereto) relating to taxable periods (or portion of a
Straddle Period) ending on or before the date of the Closing shall be the
property of the Seller (excluding (i) any refund or credit attributable to any
loss in a tax year (or portion of a Straddle Period) beginning after
the Closing Date applied (e.g., as a carryback) to income in a tax year (or
portion of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii)
amounts reflected as an asset in Net Working Capital (each such excluded
amount in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Excluded Refund_ "), and
if received by the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary, shall be paid
over to the Seller within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. The
Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Sellers expense, cause
the Company or other relevant entity to file for and use its reasonable
efforts to obtain the receipt of any refund, credit or similar benefit to
which the Seller is entitled under this  _Section 7.02_. The Purchaser shall
permit the Seller to participate in (at the Sellers expense) the prosecution
of any such claim.

 

(b) The Seller shall pay to the Purchaser any Excluded Refunds within fifteen
(15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. The Seller shall, if the
Purchaser so requests and at the Purchasers expense, cause any relevant
entity to file for and cooperate to obtain the receipt of any refund to which
the Purchaser is entitled under this _Section 7.02_. The Seller shall permit
the Purchaser to participate in (at the Purchasers expense) the prosecution
of any such refund claim.

(c) At the Purchasers request and expense, the Seller will uses its
reasonable efforts to obtain such refund (or reduction), including through the
filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims. The Purchaser agrees to
indemnify the Seller for any Taxes resulting from the disallowance of such
post-acquisition Tax attribute on audit or otherwise.

(d) The Purchaser shall elect, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to elect, as applicable, to waive any carryback of any net
operating loss, capital loss or credit on any Tax Return of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries filed in respect of a tax year ending on or before the
Closing Date.

Section 7.03. _Contests_. Any Tax audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding or of any demand or claim on the Purchaser, its Affiliates, the
Company or any Subsidiary which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or
after the lapse of time, could be grounds for indemnification by the Seller
under _Section 7.01_ shall be governed by the procedural principals of
_Section 9.05_.

 



53 Section 7.04. _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 

(a) The Seller shall prepare and file (or cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to prepare and file) all Tax Returns relating to the Company and
each Subsidiary for taxable periods ending on or before the date of the
Closing, and will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. With
respect to any such Tax Return, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser and its
authorized representative with a copy of the portion of such Tax Return
relating to the Company and each Subsidiary at least 30 days prior to the due
date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return, and the
Purchaser and its authorized representative shall have the right to review
and comment on such portion prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The Seller
and the Purchaser agree to consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any
issues arising as a result of the review of such Tax Return by the Purchaser
or its authorized representative.

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries to prepare and file) all Tax Returns that relate to the
Company or any Subsidiary for taxable periods ending after the date of the
Closing (including Straddle Periods); it being understood that all Taxes shown
as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the
Purchaser (including any Taxes reserved for on the Closing Statement), except
for such Taxes which are the responsibility of the Seller pursuant to _Section
7.01_ or _Section 9.02_ which the Seller shall pay in accordance with this
_Article VII_ or _Article IX_, as applicable. Insofar as relates to Taxes or
positions for periods ending on or before the Closing Date, such Tax Returns
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable
periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by Law. With
respect to any Tax Return required to be filed with respect to the Company or
any Subsidiary after the date of the Closing and as to which Taxes are
allocable to the Seller under _Section 7.01_ hereof, the Purchaser shall
provide the Seller and its authorized representative with a copy of the
portion of such Tax Return that is relevant to such Taxes allocable to the
Seller at least 30 days prior to the due date (including any extension
thereof) for filing of such Tax Return, and the Seller and its authorized
representative shall have the right to review, comment, and make such changes
as are reasonably requested by the Seller and its authorized representative
on such portion prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The Seller and the
Purchaser agree to consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues
arising as a result of the review of such Tax Return by the Seller or its
authorized representative.

Section 7.05. _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and
information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include (upon the other partys
reasonable request) providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by the applicable Governmental Authorities. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective
employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this _Section
7.05_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.02_, each of
the Seller and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers and all material records or other documents in its possession (or in
the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Company or
any Subsidiary for any taxable period that includes the date of the Closing
and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns
and other documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii) six years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After
such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such
documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the
other party shall be given an opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice,
to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other party
may select (at such other partys expense). Any information obtained under
this _Section 7.05_ shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund
or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 



54 Section 7.06. _Conveyance Taxes_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each bear
50 percent of any and all Conveyance Taxes that may be imposed upon, or
payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to
cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates
necessary to enable compliance with any pre-Closing filing requirements.

 

Section 7.07. _Tax Covenants_.

 

(a) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall make a Tax
election that has retroactive effect to any taxable period (or portion of any
taxable period) ending on or before the date of the Closing, without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 

(b) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall, without
the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (i) amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or
permit the Company or any Subsidiary to amend, refile or otherwise modify, any
Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any taxable period (or portion of
any taxable period) ending on or before the date of the Closing; (ii)
voluntarily initiate discussions regarding adjustments or examinations with
taxing authorities regarding Taxes with respect to any taxable period (or
portion of any taxable period) ending on or before the date of the Closing,
except as otherwise required by Law; or (iii) extend or waive any statute of
limitation with respect to Taxes attributable to any taxable period ending on
or before the date of the Closing (and in the case of an extension or waiver
with respect to a Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts provide notice thereof to the Seller).

 

Section 7.08. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat all payments made under this
_Article VII_, under any other indemnity provisions contained in this
Agreement, and for any breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements, as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

(b) For purposes of this _Article VII_ , all references to the Purchaser, the
Seller, Affiliates, the Company and any Subsidiary include successors.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this _Article
VII_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in question
(taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof).

 

(d) Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between the Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries), on the one hand,
and any of the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall have
been terminated, and all payments thereunder settled, immediately prior to the
Closing with no payments permitted to be made thereunder on and after the date
of the Closing.

Section 7.09. _Section 338 Election_. In connection with the sale of the
Shares contemplated hereby, at the election of the Seller, the parties shall
cause an express election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to be
made for the Company and its Subsidiaries for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, and shall cause similar elections to be made where appropriate for
state Tax purposes, and shall

 



55  comply with the rules and regulations applicable to such elections. For
purposes of making such elections, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
reasonably cooperate to determine the value of the tangible and intangible
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall timely jointly prepare an
allocation of the Purchasers "adjusted grossed-up basis" in the Shares
(within the meaning of the Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) among
such assets, in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation
shall be binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller for purposes of allocating
the "aggregate deemed selling price" (within the meaning of the Regulations)
among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and neither party shall
file any Tax Return, or take a position with a Tax authority, that is
inconsistent with the Allocation. Each party agrees to cooperate with the
other in the preparation of IRS Form 8594 or any similar form required by a
state taxing authority in connection with a Section 338(h)(10) election
and to furnish the other party with a copy of such form or forms prepared in
draft form within a reasonable period before its filing due date. If the
Seller and the Purchaser do not reach a written agreement as to the Allocation
prior to the 90th day after the Closing Date or, with respect to any revision
of the Allocation, within a reasonable period of time (which shall be presumed
to be 30 days), then either the Seller or the Purchaser may by notice to the
other submit to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, in accordance
with the procedural principles of _Section 2.06(c)_ and this _Section 7.09_,
of the dispute as to the Allocation.

 

Section 7.10. _Tax Year_. The parties intend that the transactions
contemplated hereby are structured in a manner that causes the Tax year of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to close as of the Closing Date for federal
income tax purposes and state income tax purposes, if applicable (and the
Purchaser shall take any and all actions reasonably necessary and permitted
by applicable Law to effectuate this result, including by including the
Company in its affiliated group for federal income tax purposes and state tax
purposes, if applicable).

an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.02_, unless and until the aggregate amount of

similar payments (after deduction for any actual increased insurance costs
(including documented future premium increases) as a result of such payment of
proceeds and any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with obtaining such proceeds) actually
received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to
the right of indemnification and (ii) any net Tax benefit actually realized by
such Indemnified Party (resulting in either (A) a reduction in cash Tax
payments otherwise required to be made or (B) a Tax refund actually received)
arising in connection with the accrual,

account any Tax detriment arising from the right to indemnification hereunder

Indemnified Party.

Section 9.05. _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any
matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 60 days of such
determination, stating the amount of the Losses, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall
not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
_Article IX_ except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is prejudiced
by such failure.

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim,
demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against it which may
give rise to a claim for Losses under this _Article IX_, within 30 days of
the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that the
Indemnified Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice if (i) it gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 15 days of the receipt of
such notice from the Indemnified Party and (ii) acknowledges in writing (in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party)
its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_
(subject to the limitations set forth herein). If the Indemnifying Party
elects to undertake any such defense against a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to assume or continue to control such defense
and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified
Party if the Indemnifying Party fails to reasonably diligently pursue the
Third Party Claim or (w) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief, (x) the Third Party Claim involves criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (y) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination of the Third Party Claim would
have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Partys business or
future business prospects, or (z) a conflict of interest exists between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third
Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment
or unless the Indemnifying Party withdraws from the defense of such Third
Party Claim liability or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be
taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the
Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes
the defense of any such claims or proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.05_
and proposes to settle such claims or proceeding prior to a final judgment
thereon or to forgo any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the settlement or
assume or reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, neither the Indemnifying
Party nor the Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the other party hereto (not to be unreasonably
withheld) if such settlement or compromise would subject the other party to
material obligations or require it to admit (or constitute an

 



60  admission of) liability; _provided_ , that the consent of the Indemnified
Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay
any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or compromise and such
settlement or compromise includes a complete, irrevocable and unconditional
written general release of the Indemnified Party from further liability, does
not result in or impose injunctive or other equitable relief, or any
obligation of specific performance, against the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates and does not require any admission of liability by or impose
any injunctive relief or material obligations or restrictions on the
Indemnified Party. 

Section 9.06. _Remedies_. The Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and agree
that, except (a) with respect to the enforcement of any rights or obligations
under _Section 2.06_ or _Section 2.08_ or any equitable remedies of the
parties hereto provided herein and (b) any fraud, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the matters described in clauses (a) and
(b), collectively, the " _Excluded Matters_ "), (i) following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of _Article VII_ , _Section 9.02_ and _Section
9.03_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser and the
Seller for any breach by the other party of the representations and warranties
in this Agreement and for any failure by the other party to perform and comply
with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, and (ii) anything herein
to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of the Purchaser or the Seller, after the consummation of the purchase
and sale of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto
shall take commercially reasonable steps as required by applicable law to
mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming actually aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses. Except for claims
under this Agreement and the Excluded Matters, from and after the Closing
the Purchaser and the Seller each disclaim, waive, and covenant not to sue
under any statutory or common law claim, with respect to any matter pertaining
or connected to this Agreement.

Section 11.03. _Public Announcements_. The parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate as to the timing and contents of their respective press releases
announcing the execution of this Agreement or the Closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 11.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 11.05. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 

Section 11.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation
of law or otherwise without the express written consent of the parties hereto
(which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of each party
hereto), as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the Purchaser
may assign the Agreement to any of its Affiliates, and (b) the Purchaser, and
after the Closing, the Company may each assign its rights (but not its
obligations) hereunder for collateral security purposes to any lender or
lenders (including any agent for any such lender or lenders)
providing financing to the

 



64  Purchaser in connection with transactions contemplated hereby, or to any
assignee or assignees of any such lender, lenders or agent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such assignment pursuant to clause (a) or clause (b)
above shall relieve the Purchaser or Parent from any of their respective
obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
heirs, successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives.

Section 11.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller
and the Purchaser (and, to the extent provided in _Section 11.09_, the
Financing Sources) or (b) by a waiver in accordance with _Section 11.08_.

Section 11.08. _Waiver_. Either party to this Agreement may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other

other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the
other party or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either party hereto to assert
any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such
rights.

Section 11.09. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (including the provisions of  _Article IX_ relating to indemnified

equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources, their
respective Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
controlling persons, employees or representatives (collectively, the "
_Financing Parties_ ") shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
11.09_, _Section 11.11_, _Section 11.12_ and _Section 11.15_ and such
Sections may not be amended or waived in a manner that impacts or is adverse
in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of
the Financing Sources.

Section 11.10.  _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
United States dollars.

 

Section 11.11. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware. All Actions
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such
Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware
state court sitting in the Wilmington, Delaware; and _provided_ , _further_ ,

Indemnified Party, as the case may be, is sued in an Action with respect to
which the Seller or such Seller Indemnified Party in entitled to

immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may 

 



65  not be enforced in or by any of the above named courts. Each of the parties
hereto (a) agrees that it will not bring or support any Action of any kind of
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York located in the Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York located in the
Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof) and (b) irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in
any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune
from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient

WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
DEBT FINANCING. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION 11.12_.

Section 11.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 11.14. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The foregoing right shall include the right of
a party to seek specific performance of any other partys obligations under
this Agreement, including the right of any party to seek specific performance
of the other partys obligations to effect the Closing under  _Section
2.03_, and the parties right to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall
be without the need of posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Prior to
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)_ or _10.01(d)_
, the terminating party shall deliver the other parties hereto at least ten
(10) Business Days prior written notice or its intent to terminate this
Agreement and the basis therefor prior to such termination and the parties
shall meet and confer in good faith for purposes of attempting to reach a
mutual agreement to maintain the effectiveness of this Agreement and avoid
such termination and any resulting purported termination shall not be
effective if the basis for such termination has been cured by the expiration
of such ten (10) Business Day period. Each of the parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity.

 



66 Section 11.15. _Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in Law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the other Ancillary
Agreements (including any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements), may be made only
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and
thereto. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement, including any
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any
named party to this Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements (" _Non-Party
Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
Law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of
an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or
liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or
such other Ancillary Document (as the case may be) or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such other Ancillary
Document (as the case may be) or the negotiation or execution hereof or
thereof; and each party waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. The Company and any person
or entity acting on behalf of the Company hereby waives and releases all of
the Non-Party Affiliates of the Seller and of the Sellers Affiliates from any
liabilities, claims and obligation arising from any action or omission by
such Non-Party Affiliate taken before the Closing. Non-Party Affiliates are
expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of this provision of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or in any related
agreement to the contrary, none of the Seller Related Parties shall have any
rights or claims against any Financing Party in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and no Financing Party shall have any rights or claims against any
Seller Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise;  _provided_ that, following the Closing Date,
the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Financing Parties under any
commitment letter or other definitive documentation related to the Debt
Financing.

 

Section 11.16. _Parent Guaranty_. To induce the Seller to enter into this
Agreement, Parent absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
the Seller (the " _Guaranty_ "), on the terms and conditions set forth herein
the due, full and punctual (i) payment of any amount payable by the Purchaser
or any amount due hereunder including Losses suffered or sustained by the
Seller as a result of or in connection with a breach of this Agreement by the
Purchaser; and (ii) performance of all of the Purchasers obligation pursuant
to this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_
"). All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States,
in immediately available funds. The Guaranty is one of payment, not collection
and Parent acknowledges that a separate action or actions may be brought and
prosecuted against Parent for the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations to
enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against
the Purchaser or any other Person or whether the Purchaser or any other
Person are joined in any such action or actions. Parent agrees that the
Guaranteed Obligations hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole
or in part, or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure or delay of the Seller
to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the
Purchaser; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition, substitution or release of any
Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, to
or from the Guaranty, this Agreement, or any related agreement or document;
(iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the
Purchaser or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
other similar proceeding affecting the Purchaser or any Person now or
hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) the

 



67  existence of any claim, set-off or other right which Parent may have at any
time against the Purchaser or the Seller whether in connection with the
Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; or (vii) the adequacy of any other means
the Seller may have of obtaining payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent hereby expressly waives any
and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law that would otherwise
require any election of remedies by the Seller. Parent hereby waives
promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Guaranty and of the
Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-
performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the incurrence of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations and all other notices of any kind (other than
notices expressly required to be provided to the Purchaser pursuant to 
_Section 11.16_), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshaling of assets of the Purchaser or any
other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and all suretyship defenses generally.
