after the Effective Date, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days
thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to, mail or deliver to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate(s) theretofore
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent or transfer of Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall have been approved in form
by the Company) advising such holder of the procedure for surrendering to the
Exchange Agent such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to _Section
3.01(b)_  hereof deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Parent Deliveries_. At least one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing, for the benefit of the holders of Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates, or at
Parent's option, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the holders of Company
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as the Merger
Consideration in exchange for their Certificate(s) and Book-Entry Shares as
provided in this  _Article III_. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to
vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed
with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.

  



  

(c) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_.

  



  

(i) Upon the Closing, each holder of an outstanding Certificate(s)
or Book-Entry Shares who has surrendered such Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to evidence of issuance in book-entry form, or
upon written request of such holder a certificate or certificates
representing, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement and any other distribution theretofore
paid after the Merger with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable in the
Merger, in each case, without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.

(ii) If a holder of Company Common Stock surrenders its
Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent, then Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following
receipt of such Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Shares and properly executed
letter of transmittal, deliver to such holder the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby have been
converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_.

  



  

(iii) Each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share which is not
surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures
provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly
surrendered to the Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and the right to receive the amount of
cash in lieu of fractional shares into which such Company Common Stock shall
have been converted. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of the Company of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares
and, if such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of
certificates for Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
hereinabove provided. No dividends which have been declared by Parent after
the Merger will be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock under _Section 3.01_ until such Person surrenders the
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares representing Company Common Stock, at
which time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without interest.

  



  

(d) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(e) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Parent pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_ that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time (as
well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the
Exchange Agent to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with _Section 3.02(c)_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the
payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of
Parent Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to any Governmental
Authority, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and any other applicable Law, become the property of Parent (and to
the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for
any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to establish
the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration
specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, Parent and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect
to any claims thereto.

Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company other than to receive the consideration provided
under this _Article III_.

  



  

3.04 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company
Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares surrendered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Parent
Average Share Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent. No such holder shall
be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.

  



  

3.05 _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the
VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

3.06 _Withholding Rights_. Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent is required under the Code or any
state, local or foreign Tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent.

  



  

3.07 _Stock Options and Stock Awards_.

  



  

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plan, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, at the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into an obligation of Parent to pay (or cause to
be paid), and a right of the holder of the Company Stock Option to receive,
cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Parent Average Share
Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio minus the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option. In the event that the product
obtained by such calculation with respect to a Company Stock Option is zero
or a negative number, then such Company Stock Option shall, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, be cancelled for no consideration. The amount
determined in accordance with the foregoing shall be paid to the applicable
holder of a Company Stock Option as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time and in no event later than thirty (30) days following the
Effective Time.

(b) Each restricted stock award issued pursuant to the Company Stock
Plan (a " _Company Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, vest in full and the restrictions
thereon shall lapse in accordance with the agreement relating to such award,
and, as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that was
formerly a Company Stock Award shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Article III_.

  



  

3.08 _Reservation of Shares_. Prior to the Closing, the Parent Board
shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for the purpose of issuing its shares in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger.

  



  

3.09 _Changes in Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed
into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class of
shares, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration and any similarly dependent
items, shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of Company
Common Stock and other securities the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

3.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is
hereby adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code.

contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in _Section 5.03_ or _5.04_ or to
one or more of its covenants contained in _Articles IV_ and _VI_ ; _provided_
, _however_ , that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
by a party that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule, such
item is or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.02 _Standard_. Except as set forth in the following sentence,
solely for the purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.02(a)_ or _7.03(a)_ , as the case may be, have been satisfied
(and without otherwise qualifying any representation or warranty made on the
date hereof), no representation or warranty of the Company on the one hand or
Parent on the other hand contained in _Sections 5.03_ or _5.04_ ,
respectively, shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes of _Sections
7.02(a) _ or _7.03(a)_ , and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached
a representation or warranty for purposes of such Sections, as a consequence
of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact,
circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or warranty
contained in  _Section 5.03_ or _5.04_ , has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the party making such representation or
warranty, disregarding for these purposes (i) any qualification or exception
for, or reference to, materiality in any such representation or warranty and
(ii) any use of the terms "material," "materially," "in all material
respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar terms or phrases in any such
representation or warranty. The foregoing standard shall not apply to

Company has in effect all federal, state, local and foreign governmental
authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of the Company
Articles and the Company Bylaws which have previously been made available to

indirectly owned by the Company. The outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable, and none of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
have been issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any Person. _Section

(k) _CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Customer Information
Security_. Parent has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better in its
most recent examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. Parent does
not have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause Parent: (i)
to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with
the CRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a
rating for CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than
"Satisfactory"; or (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation in any
material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be

well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by Parent.
To the Knowledge of Parent, no non-public customer information has been
disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner which
would cause either Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial
action. The Board of Directors of Parent (or where appropriate of any
Subsidiary of Parent) has adopted, and Parent (or such Subsidiary of
Parent) has implemented, an anti-money laundering program that contains
adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that
comply with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering
program meets the requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the
USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and Parent (or such Subsidiary
of Parent) has complied in all material respects with any requirements to
file reports and other necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act
and the regulations thereunder.

and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other parties or any of their Subsidiaries to any third party

counsel be required by Law or obligations pursuant to any listing agreement

6.06 _Access; Information._

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford Parent's officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to the books, records, properties and contracts of the
Company and, during such period, the Company shall make available to Parent
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state banking or securities laws (other than reports or documents
that the Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii)
all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of
the Company as Parent may reasonably request. The Company shall provide to
Parent all written agendas and meeting or written consent materials provided
to the directors of the Company and Bank Subsidiary in connection with board
and committee meetings, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information. Notwithstanding the above provisions in this _Section 6.06(a)_ ,
Parent and its representatives shall not be entitled to receive information
directly relating to the negotiation and prosecution of this Agreement or,
except as otherwise provided herein, relating to an Acquisition Proposal, a
Superior Proposal, a Change of Recommendation or any matters relating thereto.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or contravene any law, rule (including with respect to confidential
supervisory information), regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the previous sentence apply.

  



  

(b) All information furnished pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ shall
be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality and Non-
Disclosure Agreements, dated as of May 7, 2014 and July 7, 2014, between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ ").

  



  

6.07 _Acquisition Proposals_

  



  

(a) The Company agrees that it shall immediately cease, and shall
cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors and agents
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to immediately cease, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates and Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any
proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. Except as expressly permitted in this _Section 6.07_ ,
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.01_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, or otherwise participate in any
discussions (except to notify such person of the existence of the provisions
of this _Section 6.07_ ) or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) furnish to any Person any information concerning the Company, or any
access to the properties, books and records of the Company in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) propose, agree or publicly announce an
intention to take any of the foregoing actions or any other action which
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.07_ , if at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approvals, the Company or any of its Representatives,
receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 6.07_ ), the Company, the Company Board and its
Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with, and furnish
any information (so long as all such information has previously been made
available to Parent or is made available to Parent prior to or concurrently
with the time such information is made available to such person) and other
access to, any person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
if, and only if, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal and financial advisors, that (i)
such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the failure of the Company Board to furnish such
information or access or enter into such discussions or negotiations would be
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law; _provided_ that prior to furnishing any material
nonpublic information, the Company shall have received from the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at
least as restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the
Confidentiality Agreement dated May 7, 2014 is on Parent (excluding the
"standstill" provisions thereof), which confidentiality agreement shall not
prohibit the Company from complying with the terms of this _Section 6.07_.
The Company will promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, (x)
notify Parent in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal and the
identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and (y) communicate
the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent. The Company will
keep Parent reasonably apprised of the status of and other matters relating
to any such Acquisition Proposal on a current basis.

  



  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.07_ , neither
the Company nor the Company Board or any committee thereof shall
(i)(A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify
or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation
or (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, to
the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ") or (ii) authorize, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, securities purchase agreement or similar agreement with
respect to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in _Section 6.07(b)_ pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations
set forth therein).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approvals, the Company
Board may make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ , if (1) the Company Board receives a
written Acquisition Proposal from any person that is not withdrawn and did not
result from a breach of this _Section 6.07_ and (2) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that:

  



    

-49- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to take
such action would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; and

  



  

(ii) with respect to a Superior Proposal:

  



  

(1) the Company provides Parent prior written notice at least five
(5) Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice shall state that
the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to
effect a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ , as applicable, which notice shall specify the basis
for such Change of Recommendation or termination, including the material
terms of the Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it
being understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not in and of
itself be deemed a Change of Recommendation);

  



  

(2) during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company negotiates
in good faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent wishes to negotiate) to
enable Parent to make an offer that is at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(3) at the end of such five (5)-Business Day period (or such earlier
time that Parent advises the Company that it no longer wishes to negotiate to
amend this Agreement), the Company Board, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by
Parent after receipt of such notice again determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

  



  

It is understood that and agreed that any amendment to the financial or other
material terms of the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal giving rise to
a new response period for Parent, except that the five (5)-Business Day
period referred to in clause (1) above shall be reduced to three (3) Business
Days following the giving of such new Notice of Superior Proposal.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company
to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable law or (iii) informing any person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.07_.

  



    

-50-

--- 

    



  

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean
any proposal or offer (whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person
(other than Parent and any Affiliates thereof) relating to, or that is
reasonably expected to lead to, any direct or indirect purchase or
acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of (A)
any assets or businesses of the Company that constitute 25% or more of the
Company's consolidated assets or (B) beneficial ownership (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the total outstanding
voting securities of the Company or Bank Subsidiary pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock,
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction.

  



  

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean
any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal on terms which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, and taking into account all the
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of
view than the terms of this Agreement (in each case, taking into account any
revisions to this Agreement made or proposed by Parent and is reasonably
capable of being completed on the terms proposed); _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "25%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

  



  

6.08 _Exchange Listing_. Parent shall, as promptly as practicable,
file all documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use
its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to
the Company stockholders as part of the Merger Consideration in connection
with the Merger.

  



  

6.09 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matter in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any persons who are
or were serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another entity (including any
Company Benefit Plan) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), as
provided in the Company Articles or Company Bylaws or other indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals
for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

  



    

-51-

(b) Parent shall provide for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
insurance to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the
Company covering, without limitation, claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated hereby, which insurance shall contain terms and conditions
(including with respect to coverage) no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than the existing directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent be required to expend annually in the
aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") and _provided_
, _further_ , that if Parent is unable to maintain such policy (or substitute
policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Parent shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent, or the Company in
consultation with Parent for an aggregate price of no more than 250% of the
Insurance Amount, may obtain, on or prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)
year "tail" prepaid policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence. From and after the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor the Company shall take any action that would materially prejudice the
rights of, or otherwise impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of any
insurance policy contemplated by this _Section 6.09(c)_ , whether in respect
of claims arising before or after the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) The obligations of Parent under this _Section 6.09_ shall not be
terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Person, or any other Person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 6.09_ ,
to whom this _Section 6.09 _ applies without the consent of the affected
Indemnified Person or such other Person, as the case may be. If Parent or
any of its respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each
other Person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 6.09_ , his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

  



  

6.10 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Date, Parent shall provide to officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, who at or after the Effective Date become employees of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (" _Company Continuing Employees_ "), employee benefits
under Parent Benefit Plans, on terms and conditions which are the same as for
similarly situated officers and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Until such time as the Company Continuing Employees are able to participate
in the Parent Benefit Plans, Parent shall maintain for the benefit of the
Company Continuing Employees the Company Benefit Plans in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Date (it being understood that participation in the
Parent Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each
such Parent Benefit Plan).

  



    

-52- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and benefit accrual
(except not for purposes of benefit accrual with respect to any plan in which
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits) under the Parent
Benefit Plans, service with or credited by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with Parent. To the extent permitted
under applicable law, Parent shall cause welfare Parent Benefit Plans that
cover the Company Continuing Employees after the Effective Date to (i) waive
any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for preexisting
conditions or insurability (except for pre-existing conditions that
were excluded, or restrictions or limitations that were applicable, under the
Company Benefit Plans), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance, flexible
spending account contribution or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the
Company Continuing Employees under welfare Company Benefit Plans to be
credited to such Company Continuing Employees under welfare Parent Benefit
Plans, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum
out-of-pocket payments payable by, and provide credit for any flexible
spending account contributions already made by, such Company Continuing
Employees under welfare Parent Benefit Plans. Any paid time off amount with
respect to each Company Continuing Employee that is accrued and outstanding as
of the Effective Date shall be carried over or cashed out by Parent in its
sole discretion at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Date, as the case may be.

  



  

(c) Parent shall provide to employees of the Company whose
employment is terminated on or within one (1)-year of the Effective Date
under circumstances entitling the employee to severance benefits under
paragraph (d) of this _Section 6.10_ , outplacement services appropriate to
the employee's position, as determined by reasonable competitive practices,
for a period of six (6) months from the date of termination.

  



  

(d) Parent shall assume and honor the obligations of the Company
under all employment, severance, change in control, consulting,
retirement and other compensation contracts, arrangements, commitments or
understandings as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on
_Section 5.03(o)_ of the Company's Disclosure Schedule, in accordance with
their terms. Parent hereby acknowledges that the Merger will constitute a
"Change in Control" (or concept of similar import) in accordance with the
provisions of the Company Benefit Plans. Parent shall, after consummation of
the Merger, pay all amounts provided under such Company Benefit Plans and
agreements as a result of a change in control of the Company, as applicable,
in accordance with their respective terms, and to honor all rights,
privileges and modifications to or with respect to any such Company Benefit
Plans or agreements which become effective as a result of such change in
control.

  



  

(e) With respect to the Company's 401(k) plan, the Company shall
cause such plan to be fully vested and terminated effective immediately prior
to the Effective Date, in accordance with applicable law and subject to the
receipt of all applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each Company
Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Company's 401(k) plan shall be
eligible to participate in Parent's 401(k) plan as soon as administratively
practical after the Effective Date, and account balances under the
terminated Company 401(k) plan will be eligible for distribution or rollover,
including direct rollover of both cash and promissory notes to Parent's
401(k) plan for the Company Continuing Employees. Any other former employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries who is employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries
after the Effective Date shall be eligible to be a participant in
Parent's 401(k) plan upon complying with eligibility requirements. For
purposes of administering Parent's 401(k) plan, service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with Parent for participation
and vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit accrual.

  



    

-53-

(f) With respect to the Company's ESOP, prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall adopt an amendment to the ESOP providing that, upon the
Closing and subject to the consummation of the Merger, (i) the ESOP shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, (ii) no new participants shall be admitted
to the ESOP after the Closing, and (iii) all ESOP participants' accounts shall
be 100% vested on and after the ESOP termination date. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall cause the ESOP Trustee to repay in full the
outstanding indebtedness of the ESOP loan, subject to the terms of the ESOP,
the ESOP loan agreement, the ESOP pledge agreement and the ESOP Trust, by
delivering a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Company Common Stock
to the Company, subject to and in accordance with applicable law. At the
Effective Time, all remaining shares of the Company Common Stock held by the
ESOP immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and allocated to ESOP participants'
accounts. The ESOP account balances shall not be distributed to ESOP
participants until the ESOP has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service. In the event that the Closing occurs prior
to December 31, 2014, the Company may make a pro rata payment on the
outstanding ESOP indebtedness of the amount accrued through the Closing Date,
which accruals shall be made consistent with past practice.

  



  

(g) With respect to the Company's defined benefit pension plan,
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt a resolution
providing that benefit accruals for the pension plan shall be frozen such
that (i) no additional years of credited service for benefit accrual purposes
will be earned after the freeze date under the pension plan; and (ii)
compensation earned by participants after the freeze date will not be taken
into account under the pension plan. The Company shall take all necessary
steps prior to the Closing Date to freeze the pension plan benefit accruals
in accordance with ERISA and the pension plan, including providing
participants all required notices.

  



  

(h) This  _Section 6.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 6.10_.

  



  

(i) Except as provided in this _Section 6.10(i)_ , nothing in this
_Section 6.10_ shall be construed to limit the right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Date, to amend or terminate any of
the Parent Benefit Plans or the Company Benefit Plans maintained by the
respective parties before the Effective Date to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable Parent Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Plans, _provided_ that such amendment or termination shall
not relieve Parent from its obligations under this _Section 6.10_.

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to
result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein.

  



  

6.12 _Governance Matters_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Date, Parent shall cause Richard T. Wheeler,
Jr. to be appointed to the Board of Directors of Parent to serve in such
capacity until such time as his successor shall be duly elected and qualified.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Date, Parent shall establish the

The TowneBank Richmond Board shall initially be comprised of individuals
chosen by Parent from the current members of the Board of Directors of the
Company and Bank Subsidiary, together with other business and community
leaders chosen by Parent after consultation with the Company. Membership on
the TowneBank Richmond Board shall be conditional upon execution of an
agreement providing that such person will not engage in activities competitive
with Parent until the later of the date that is two (2) years following the
Effective Date or the date on which he or she ceases to be a member of the
TowneBank Richmond Board.

  



  

6.13 _Voting Agreement_. The Company has identified to Parent all
persons who are, as of the date hereof, directors or executive officers of
the Company. The Company shall have delivered to Parent on or prior to the
date hereof executed copies of a written agreement in the form of _Exhibit B_
hereto from each such director or executive officer.

  



  

6.14 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give the other prompt notice of any shareholder litigation against such
party or its directors or affiliates (or combination thereof) relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give the other the
opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of
any such litigation. In addition, no such settlement by the Company shall be
agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  



  

6.15 _Investment Portfolio_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof and in any event prior to the Closing Date, the Company and
Bank Subsidiary shall, subject to and consistent with applicable Law and
prudent investment management practices: (i) divest all the equity securities

and which are listed in  _Section 6.15_ of the Company's Disclosure Schedule;
and (ii) divest the corporate bonds it holds listed in _Section 6.15_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule so as to conform its investment portfolio to the
extent practicable in a manner that is consistent with the policies and
practices of Parent.

exclusive remedy of Parent or the Company as the case may be in the event of
termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in such section. In the
event that the Company fails to pay when due any amounts payable under this
_Section 8.03_ , then (1) such party shall reimburse the other party for all
costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel)
incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount, and (2)

ARTICLE IX 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

9.01 _Survival_. No representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other
than agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express terms are
to be performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this
Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, except
as provided for in _Section 8.02_. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, no representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished
so as to deprive a party hereto or any of its affiliates of any defense at
law or in equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of any
Person, including without limitation any stockholder or former stockholder.

9.02 _Waiver; Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision
of this Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the
provision or (ii) amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing
among the parties hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement,
except that after the approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by the
Company stockholders and the Parent stockholders, no amendment shall be made
which by law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company or
Parent without obtaining such approval. For purposes of clarification, an
amendment of any date in _Section 8.01(c)_ shall not require further approval
by any stockholders and if such amendment were deemed by law to require
further approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent, the approval
of the principal terms of this Agreement by the Company stockholders and the
Parent stockholders will be deemed to have granted the Company and Parent the
authority to amend such dates without such further approval.

  



  

9.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such
Commonwealth.

hereunder to a party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if
personally delivered, telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered

Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreements represent
the entire understanding of the parties hereto and thereto with reference to
the Transaction, and this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the

intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, nothing in

9.07 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this
_Section 9.07_ would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
Parent, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal
and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the
original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

  



  

9.08 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In the event attorneys' fees or other costs are incurred to secure
performance of any of the obligations herein provided for, or to establish
damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief,
whether by way of prosecution or defense, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred therein.

  



  

9.09 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the
words "as of the date hereof" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
to mean the day and year first above written.

  



  

9.10 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

9.11 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the
acquisition of the Company set forth herein, _provided_ that (i) the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock is not
thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such modification,
(ii) such modifications will not adversely affect the tax treatment to the
Company's stockholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration and
(iii) such modification will not materially jeopardize receipt of any required
approvals of Governmental Authorities or delay consummation of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

or Book-Entry Shares who has surrendered such Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to evidence of issuance in book-entry form, or
upon written request of such holder a certificate or certificates
representing, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been
converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger and any other distribution
theretofore paid after the Merger with respect to Parent Common Stock
issuable in the Merger, in each case, without interest. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices.

(d) If a holder of Company Common Stock surrenders its
Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent, then Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following
receipt of such Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Shares and properly executed
letter of transmittal, deliver to such holder the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_.

  



  

(e) Each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share which is not
surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures
provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly
surrendered to the Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and the right to receive the amount of
cash in lieu of fractional shares into which such Company Common Stock shall
have been converted. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of the Company of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares
and, if such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of
certificates for Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
hereinabove provided. No dividends which have been declared by Parent after
the Merger will be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock under _Section 2.01_ until such Person surrenders the
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares representing Company Common Stock, at
which time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without interest.

  



  

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate.

  



  

(g) Any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.02(b) _ that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after
the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof)
shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any stockholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with _Section 2.02(c)_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for the consideration deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Plan of Merger without any interest thereon. If
outstanding Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Company
Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior
to the date on which such shares of Parent Common Stock or cash would
otherwise escheat to any Governmental Authority (as defined in the
Agreement), the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and any other applicable Law (as defined in the Agreement), become
the property of Parent (and to the extent not in its possession shall be
delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any
party to the Agreement or this Plan of Merger shall be liable to any holder of
stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for any
consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to establish
the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration specified
in this Plan of Merger, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto.
In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by
any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an
independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims
thereto.

(h) At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other
than to receive the consideration provided under this _Article II_.

  



  

2.03 _Company Stock Options and Stock Awards_.

  



  

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Franklin Financial Corporation
2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
at the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into an obligation of Parent to pay (or cause to be paid), and a
right of the holder of the Company Stock Option to receive, cash in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the Parent Average Share Price multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio minus the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option. In the event that the product obtained by such
calculation with respect to a Company Stock Option is zero or a
negative number, then such Company Stock Option shall, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, be cancelled for no consideration. The amount determined
in accordance with the foregoing shall be paid to the applicable holder of a
Company Stock Option as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time and in no event later than thirty (30) days following the
Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Each restricted stock award issued pursuant to the Company
Stock Plan (a " _Company Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, vest in full and the
restrictions thereon shall lapse in accordance with the agreement relating to
such award, and, as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
that was formerly a Company Stock Award shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Article III_.

  



  

2.04 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Plan of Merger, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company
Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares surrendered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Parent
Average Share Price (as defined herein), rounded to the nearest whole cent.
No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other
rights in respect of any fractional share. As used herein, the term " _Parent
Average Share Price_ " means the average of the closing price per share of
Parent Common Stock, as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the
ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth trading
day prior to the Closing Date (as defined in the Agreement).

2.05 _Changes in Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan of Merger to the contrary, if,
between the date of the Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have
been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a
different class of shares, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration and any
similarly dependent items, shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide
the holders of Company Common Stock and other securities the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Plan of Merger prior to such event.

  



  

2.06 _Withholding Rights_. Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent is required under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any state, local or foreign Tax (as
defined in the Agreement) law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent.

  



  

2.07 _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the
VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
the Agreement and this Plan of Merger.

and among TowneBank, a Virginia banking corporation (" _Parent_ "), Franklin
Financial Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the " _Company_ "), and the
undersigned stockholder of the Company (the " _Stockholder_ "). All
capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have approved a
business combination of their companies through the merger (the " _Merger_

subsidiary of the Company, with and into Parent pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of July 14,
2014, by and among Parent, the Company and Franklin Federal Savings Bank, and
a related Plan of Merger (together, the " _Merger Agreement_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Stockholder is the beneficial and/or registered owner of, and
has the right and power to vote or direct the disposition of the number of
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company
Common Stock_ ") set forth opposite the Stockholder's name on _Schedule A_
hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Company Common Stock
subsequently acquired by the Stockholder during the term of this Agreement,
but excluding the shares of common stock described in the last sentence of
Section 5(a) hereof, are referred to herein as the " _Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent, the Company and Bank
Subsidiary entering into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder has agreed to
enter into and perform this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, representations,

(a) _Ownership. _ The Stockholder is the beneficial and/or
registered owner of the Shares as set forth opposite the Stockholder's
name on _Schedule A_ hereto. Except for the Stockholder's Shares, the
Stockholder is not the beneficial or registered owner of any other shares of
Company Common Stock or rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and
for which Stockholder has the right and power to vote and/or dispose. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" shall be
interpreted in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

  



  

(b) _Restrictions on Transfer._ During the term of this Agreement,
the Stockholder will not sell, pledge, hypothecate, grant a security
interest in, transfer or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares
and will not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other
than a proxy for the purpose of voting the Stockholder's Shares in accordance
with Section 1 hereof) which would during that term (i) restrict, (ii)
establish a right of first refusal to, or (iii) otherwise relate to, the
transfer or voting of the Shares, unless the purchaser or transferee agrees
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Authority. _ The Stockholder has full power, authority and
legal capacity to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform fully the Stockholder's obligations hereunder. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder,
enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(d) _No Breach._ None of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will result in a violation of, or a default under, or
conflict with, any contract, loan and credit arrangements, Liens (as defined
below), trust, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or
restriction of any kind to which the Stockholder is a party or bound or to
which the Shares are subject.

  



  

(e) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Stockholder does not, and the performance by the
Stockholder of his or her obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation by him or her of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
require the Stockholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or to make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority.

  



  

(f) _No Solicitation_. During the term of this Agreement, the
Stockholder shall not, nor shall he or she permit any investment
banker, attorney or other adviser or representative of the Stockholder to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of
any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal.

The Stockholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder
shall attach to the Shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity

operation of law or otherwise, including the Stockholder's successors or
assigns. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, merger, exchange,
reorganization, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of
the Company affecting the Shares, the number of Shares subject to the terms of
this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted, and this Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to any additional securities of the
Company issued to or acquired by the Stockholder.

  



  

5. Capacity; Obligation to Vote.

including actions permitted to be taken in compliance with Section 6.07 of the
Merger Agreement. The term "Shares" shall not include any securities
beneficially owned by the Stockholder as a trustee or fiduciary, and this
Agreement is not in any way intended to affect the exercise by the Stockholder
of his or her fiduciary responsibility in respect of any such securities.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding the provisions
contained in Section 1 hereof, the Stockholder shall not be obligated to vote
as required in Section 1 of this Agreement in the event that (i) Parent is in
material default with respect to any covenant, representation, warranty or
agreement with respect to it contained in the Merger Agreement, or (ii) the
Company is otherwise entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement.

  



  

6. Term; Termination.

  



  

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement

of the Merger Agreement. Other than as provided for herein, following the
termination of this Agreement, there shall be no further liabilities or
obligations hereunder on the part of the Stockholder, the Company or Parent,
or their respective officers or directors, except that nothing in this Section
6 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for breach of this
Agreement before such termination.

the applicable party hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. Each party
hereto waives the posting of any bond or security in connection with any
proceeding related thereto.

13. Severability.

  



  

In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable any other provisions hereof. Any provision
of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall
