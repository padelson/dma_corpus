Incorporation    -iv-  6         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this
"AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of November 15, 2000 (the "Execution
Date") by and among TeleCommunication Systems, Inc., a Maryland corporation
("ACQUIROR"), Windward Acquisition Corp., a Washington State corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("MERGER SUB"), XYPOINT Corporation, a
Washington State corporation ("TARGET").   RECITALS   The Boards of
Directors of Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub believe it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and the stockholders of their
respective companies that Target and Merger Sub combine into a single company
through the statutory merger of Target with and into Merger Sub with Merger
Sub being the surviving corporation in the merger (the "MERGER") and, in
furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger.   A. Pursuant to the Merger,
among other things, each outstanding share of the capital stock of Target
shall be converted into shares of Class A common stock of Acquiror, $0.01 par
value per share ("ACQUIROR COMMON STOCK"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and at the exchange rates set forth herein.  
B. Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and
warranties and other agreements and covenants in connection with the
Merger.   C. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt
a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and to cause the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and
368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.   D. Concurrent with the execution of this
Agreement and as an inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement,
certain shareholders of Target (collectively, the "TARGET PRINCIPAL
SHAREHOLDERS") are entering into an agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "VOTING AGREEMENT") to vote the shares of
Target Capital Stock (as defined herein) beneficially owned or controlled by
such person to approve this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and against any competing proposals.  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER   At the
Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Articles of Merger substantially in the
form attached     7  hereto as Exhibit B (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") and
the applicable provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act
("WASHINGTON LAW"), Target shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, in
accordance with Washington Law and other applicable law, the separate
corporate existence of Target shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as
the surviving corporation. Merger Sub as the surviving corporation after the
Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION."   1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME   The closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "CLOSING") shall be held at the offices
of Piper Marbury Rudnick and Wolfe LLP at 6225 Smith Avenue, Baltimore,
Maryland 21209, on December 29, 2000; provided, however, that in the event
that all the conditions to the Closing set forth in Articles VI and VII below
shall not have been satisfied or waived by that time, then the Closing shall
occur on the third business day after such conditions have been satisfied or
waived (the date on which the Closing shall occur being the "CLOSING DATE").
On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Washington, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of Washington Law (the time and date of such filing being the "EFFECTIVE
TIME" and the "EFFECTIVE DATE," respectively).   1.3 EFFECT OF THE
MERGER   At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be
as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the applicable
provisions of Washington Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Target shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.  
1.4 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION; BYLAWS   (a) At the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Washington Law and such
articles of incorporation.   (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by
Washington Law. Thereafter, the Bylaws may be amended or repealed in
accordance with their terms and the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and as provided by law.   1.5 DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS   At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the
Target shall resign and be removed and the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, to hold office until such time as such directors
resign, are   -2-   8   removed or their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified. The officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, to hold office until such time as such officers resign, are
removed or their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.   1.6 EFFECT ON TARGET CAPITAL STOCK AND OPTIONS   By virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, Target
or the holders of any of Target\'s securities:   (a) Conversion of Target
Capital Stock. (i) Subject to Section 1.6(c) below, on the Effective Date,
all Target capital stock outstanding, including all common stock, preferred
stock and shares reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding warrants and
options to purchase common and preferred stock (the "TARGET CAPITAL STOCK"),
immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall, without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be canceled and converted into an aggregate of
4,300,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded to the nearest 0.01
share), as set forth below; provided, however, the assumption of any New
Options (as defined in Section 4.3) or the issuance of any shares of Acquiror
Common Stock as a result of the exercise of any New Options shall be in
addition to such 4,300,00 shares of Acquiror Common Stock and shall be
exchanged at the same rate as the Common Stock Exchange Ratio. Any
shares with respect to which dissenter\'s rights shall have been perfected in
accordance with Washington Law (the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall be excluded
from the foregoing and the aggregate requirement for delivery of 4,300,000
shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be accordingly reduced.   (i)
Conversion of Target Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of
Target Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) will be converted automatically into
the right to receive that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to
the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of
Acquiror Common Stock.   (ii) Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. At
the Effective Time, each share of Target Series A Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive
that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Series A Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Acquiror Common Stock.  
(iii) Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, each
share of Target Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive that number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Series B Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole share of Acquiror Common Stock.   (iv) Conversion of
Series C Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Target Series
C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into
the right to receive that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to
the Series C Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of
Acquiror Common Stock.   -3-  9     (v) Conversion of Series D
Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Target Series D
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into
the right to receive that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to
the Series D Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of
Acquiror Common Stock.   (vi) Conversion of Series E Preferred Stock. At
the Effective Time, each share of Target Series E Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive
that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Series E Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Acquiror Common Stock.  
(vii) Conversion of Series X Junior Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time,
each share of Target Series X Junior Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares)
will be automatically converted into the right to receive that number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Series X Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share of Acquiror Common Stock.   (b) Fractional
Shares. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued; in
lieu thereof, each holder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest (after
aggregating all fractional shares to be received by such holder) shall
receive from Acquiror an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
based on the market value of Acquiror Common Stock as determined by
multiplying such fraction by the price per share of Class A Common Stock, as
listed on the NASDAQ National Market, on the close of trading the day prior
to Closing. Each such holder shall have no other rights with respect to such
fractional interest and shall have no rights as a stockholder of Acquiror.  
(c) Escrow of Shares. Of the shares of the Acquiror Common Stock to be issued
by the Acquiror at the Effective Date, 400,000 shares (the "Escrow Shares")
shall be deposited into an escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND") in accordance with
Article IX and the Escrow Agreement (as defined hereinafter), which shall be
registered in the name of the Escrow Agent (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) as nominee for the holders of such shares. Such Escrow
Shares shall be beneficially owned by such holders and shall be held in
escrow and shall be available to compensate Acquiror for damages as provided
in Article IX and the Escrow Agreement. To the extent not used for such
purposes, such shares shall be released, all as provided in Article IX and in
the Escrow Agreement.   (d) Assumption of Common Options and Target Warrants
and New Options.   At the Effective Time all unexpired and unexercised
Common Options and Target Warrants and New Options then outstanding, whether
vested or unvested, together with the Target Stock Plans, shall be assumed by
the Acquiror in accordance with provisions described below.   (i) At the
Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised Target Option and Target
Warrant and New Option then outstanding, whether vested or unvested, together
with the Target Stock Plans, shall be, in connection with the Merger, assumed
by the   -4-  10      Acquiror. Each Target Option and Target Warrant
and New Option so assumed by the Acquiror under this Agreement shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable
to such Target Option or Target Warrant or New Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided that (1) such Target Option or Target Warrant or
New Option, as the case may be, shall be exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares
of Target Capital Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Target
Option or Target Warrant or New Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio applicable to the series or class of
Target Capital Stock subject to the Target Option or Target Warrant or New
Option (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock) and (2) the per share exercise price for the shares of Acquiror Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Target Option or Target Warrant
or New Option, as the case may be, shall be equal to the quotient determined
by dividing the exercise price per share of Target Capital Stock at which
such Target Option or Target Warrant or New Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio
applicable to the series or class of Target Capital Stock subject to the
Target Option or Target Warrant or New Option (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent).   (ii) The adjustments provided in this Section 1.6(d)
with respect to any Outstanding Option which are "incentive stock options"
(as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "CODE") shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. Within thirty (30) days following
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deliver to former holders of Common
Options and New Options appropriate agreements representing the right to
acquire Acquiror Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 1.6(d).   (e) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time,
each share of Merger Sub common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (f) Dissenters\' Rights. Any Dissenting Shares,
which as of the Effective Date the holder thereof has not withdrawn or lost
any right to such appraisal, shall not be converted into Acquiror Common
Stock or represent the right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock and
shall not receive or represent the right to receive any cash in lieu of
fractional shares but instead shall be converted into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Washington Law. The Target shall give the
Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares
of Target Capital Stock, withdrawals or modifications of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to Washington Law and received by the
Target which relate to any such demand for appraisal and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to
the Closing. Target agrees that, except with the prior written consent of
Acquiror, it will not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any claim, demand or other liability with respect to any Dissenting
Shares. Each holder of Dissenting Shares (a "DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER") who,
pursuant to the provisions of Washington Law becomes     -5- 
11      entitled to payment of the fair value for shares of Target
Capital Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value
therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such
provisions) and thereupon such Dissenting Shares shall be canceled, retired
and cease to exist. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall
lose their status as Dissenting Shares (either because the Dissenting
Shareholder withdraws, fails to perfect or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal), Acquiror shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such
Dissenting Shareholder of a certificate or certificates representing shares
of Target Capital Stock, the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to
which such Dissenting Shareholder would otherwise be entitled under Section
1.6(a) and the Articles of Merger, without interest thereon. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Acquiror shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement and be released from all obligations
hereunder if, immediately prior to the proposed Effective Date, Target
shareholders who would otherwise receive in excess of 5% of the
4,300,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be delivered in connection with
the Merger have demanded appraisal rights (which demands have not been
withdrawn).   1.7 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES   (a) Exchange Agent. Acquiror, or
an agent designated by it, shall act as exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT")
in the Merger.   (b) Acquiror to Provide Acquiror Common Stock and Cash.
After the Effective Time, Acquiror shall make available in accordance with
this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Acquiror may adopt, (i)
the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in
exchange for shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time less the Escrow Shares deposited in the Escrow Fund
pursuant to the requirements of Article IX and the Escrow Agreement, and (ii)
cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(b).   (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record (the "FORMER TARGET SHAREHOLDERS") of a certificate or
certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock, whose shares
were converted into the right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.6(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the
Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Acquiror may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon
surrender of a Certificate, free and clear of all Liens (as defined herein
below) and other charges thereon of every kind, for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock
(less the Escrow Shares to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder\'s
behalf pursuant to Article IX and the Escrow Agreement), and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. "LIENS" means any mortgage,
lien (including mechanics, warehousemen, laborers and landlords liens),  
-6-    12    claim, pledge, charge, security interest, preemptive
right, right of first refusal, option, judgment, title defect or encumbrance
of any kind. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior
to the Effective Time, represented shares of Target Capital Stock will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other
than the payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of
full shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which such shares of Target Capital
Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time and subject to and in accordance with the provisions
of Section 9.3, Acquiror shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent a
certificate or certificates representing the Escrow Shares, which shall be
registered in the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for the holders of
Certificates cancelled pursuant to this Section 1.7(c).   (d) Distributions
with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Acquiror Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Acquiror Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of
such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time which would have been previously
payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with respect to such
shares of Acquiror Common Stock.   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any
certificate for shares of Acquiror Common Stock is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Acquiror or the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in
Section 2.13) required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares
of Acquiror Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Acquiror or the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.   (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 1.7, no party hereto or any of their respective agents shall
be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  
(g) Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 1.7 also shall apply to
Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations
of Acquiror under this Section 1.6 shall commence on the date of loss of such
status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for such shares the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6.    -7-   13    1.8 NO
FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN TARGET CAPITAL STOCK   All shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Target

with respect to any Target Employee Plan, which would reasonably be expected
to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Target; (iii) each
Target Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects in

nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA has occurred;
(vii) no Target Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Target nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; and (viii) each Target Employee Plan can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, without any material Liability to Acquiror (other
than ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination
event). With respect to each Target Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either
an employee pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an
employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
Target has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite Governmental
Entity reports (which were true and correct as of the date filed) and has
properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports
to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each

ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.   (g) Neither Target

hereunder.   5.3 ACQUIROR COMMON STOCK   At the Effective Date, the
Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in exchange for the Target Capital Stock
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, and non-assessable, free of preemptive rights and free
and clear of all Liens created by or through Acquiror, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. The Acquiror Common Stock to be
issued upon exchange for the Target Capital Stock pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement will be issued in all material respects in accordance with
applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.   5.4
REGISTRATION OF SHARES   Acquiror, with the assistance of Target and its
representatives, will promptly file a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the
"REGISTRATION STATEMENT") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") and a prospectus which shall satisfy all applicable requirements of
applicable state and federal laws, including the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and applicable state securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Registration Statement shall also include any information
required under applicable law in connection with the shareholders\' meeting
or consent solicitation Target will hold or conduct pursuant to Section 4.4
hereof. The number of shares to be registered will be an amount sufficient to
allow all of the shares of the Acquiror Common Stock issued to holders of the
Target Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement to be registered under the
Securities Act.   -40-  46     Acquiror will use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
and, after the Registration Statement has been declared effective to make the
Registration Statement available for mailing to the shareholders of the
Target. Acquiror may rely upon all information expressly provided to it by
Target and its representatives for inclusion in the preparation of the
Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto and shall not be
liable for any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a
material fact in the Registration Statement, the post-effective amendment, if
such statement is made in reliance upon any information expressly provided to
it by Target or by any of its officers or representatives for inclusion in
the Registration Statement. Acquiror shall promptly take all such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to comply in all material respects
with all applicable securities laws of any state having jurisdiction over the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger. Acquiror shall
furnish Target with copies of all such filings and keep Target advised of the
status thereof. Acquiror shall promptly notify Target of all communications,
oral or written, with the SEC concerning the Registration Statement. Prior to
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall file with the NASDAQ Stock Market a
Notification Form for Listing of Additional Shares with respect to the shares
of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Target Capital Stock
in the Merger, and in respect of the Common Options and Target Warrants and
New Options being assumed by Acquiror.   5.5 CURRENT INFORMATION; ADVICE OF
CHANGES; CONDUCT OF BUSINESS   Between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall promptly advise Target, by written update to
the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event which would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of
Target to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied, or (b) the failure of Acquiror to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would be likely to result in
any condition to the obligations of Target to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied. The delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to Target. Without the approval and consent of Target, Acquiror and
its subsidiaries will not agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with,
by purchasing an equity interest in, or a portion of the assets of, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof if any such business or
assets to be acquired includes products that could reasonably be considered
to be competitive with Target\'s business in any material respect (a
"COMPETITIVE BUSINESS") and would reasonably be likely delay or prolong the
waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger at any time
before the applicable waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR
Act shall have expired or have been earlier terminated, unless in connection
with that acquisition Acquiror agrees with the applicable Governmental Entity
to hold separate such Competitive Business or take similar actions that would
cause such Governmental Entity to permit promptly the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger.   -41-  47      5.6 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS   Between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Date, Acquiror will consult with Target
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as counsel may advise is required by
law.   5.7 ESCROW AGREEMENT   Acquiror shall execute and deliver the
Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.  
5.8 COOPERATION AND CONDITIONS   Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the conditions specified in Articles VI and VII have
been satisfied on a prompt basis. Acquiror agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including cooperating fully with the other
party, including by provision of information.   5.9 FORM S-8 REGISTRATION
STATEMENT   Acquiror agrees to file, no later than 30 days after the
Closing, a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms) that will register the shares of Acquiror Common Stock
issuable pursuant to outstanding options under the Target Stock Option Plan
assumed by Acquiror to the extent permitted by federal securities laws;
provided, that Acquiror has received not less than ten business days prior to
such projected filing date, all option documentation relating to the
outstanding options; and provided further, that such options qualify for
registration on such Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms).
Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. In addition,
Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquiror
Common Stock subject to Common Options to be listed on The NASDAQ National
Market and such exchanges as Acquiror shall determine.   5.10 TAX FREE
REORGANIZATION   Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub will not, either before or
after consummation of the Merger, take any action or fail to take any action
which would cause the Merger to fail to constitute a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Code Section 368 and the Acquiror and Merger Sub will each
use commercially reasonable efforts not to permit any of its directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, agents, consultants, or other
representatives to take any such action. Acquiror and Merger Sub each agree
to file their respective federal and state income tax returns consistent with
treatment of the Merger as a reorganization.   -42-  48        
5.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS.   To the extent that service is relevant for
eligibility, vesting and (except as would result in duplication of benefits)
benefit accruals under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Acquiror or any subsidiary of Acquiror, such plan, program or
arrangement shall credit each employee of Target (a "TARGET EMPLOYEE") who
participates therein for service on or prior to the Effective Time with
Target or any affiliate or predecessor of any of them. Acquiror agrees to
offer to Target Employees benefits commensurate with those benefits conferred
to Acquiror employees similarly situated. In addition, Acquiror shall (i)
waive limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions under
any Acquiror or subsidiary of Acquiror welfare benefit plan in which Target
Employees may participate and (ii) recognize, for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of- pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Target Employees and their
respective dependents under Target\'s medical, dental and other
healthcare plans in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. In
the event any Target Employee is terminated from employment prior to
participation in a health benefit plan of Acquiror or an Acquiror subsidiary
and is eligible for COBRA continuation coverage under a Target Benefit Plan,
prior to termination of such Target Benefit Plan Acquiror shall assure that
such Target Employee\'s COBRA continuation coverage shall be provided under a
health benefit plan of Acquiror or an Acquiror subsidiary for so long as such
Target Employee would be eligible for such COBRA coverage but for the
termination of the Target Benefit Plan.   Acquiror also confirms its intent
and plan to grant options to purchase Acquiror Common Stock to management and
employees after the Effective Date in amounts sufficient to cause management
and employees of Target to have options on a number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock generally consistent with the option levels held by comparable
level employees of Acquiror (taking into account Common Options and New
Options assumed by Acquiror).   5.12 TARGET OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.   (a)
Acquiror agrees that all rights to indemnification (including advancement of
expenses) existing on the date hereof in favor of the present or former
officers and directors of Target (collectively, the "TARGET
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") with respect to actions taken in their capacities as
officers and directors prior to the Effective Time as provided in Target\'s
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws and indemnification agreements, shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six
years following the Effective Time and shall be guaranteed by Acquiror.  
(b) Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the
current policy of officers\' and directors\' liability insurance, for acts
and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, maintained by
Target provided that Acquiror may substitute therefor (i) policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
no less advantageous in any material respect to the Target Indemnified
Parties and (ii) coverage under Acquiror\'s directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance coverage for acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time;
provided, Acquiror shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such
insurance in excess of 100% of   -43-  49   the last annual premium paid
by Target prior to the date hereof (as adjusted for inflation), but in such
case shall provide as much coverage as possible for such amount. The last
annual premium paid by Target was $28,000.00.   (c) This Section 5.12 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, and is intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Target Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its respective successors and assigns.   5.13
REPORTS UNDER SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934   With a view to making
available to the Target stockholders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT"), and any other rule
or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit such Target stockholders
to sell securities of Acquiror to the public, Acquiror agrees, for a period
of two years from the Effective Date, to:   (a) use reasonably commercial
efforts to make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in SEC Rule 144, at all times so long as Acquiror
remains subject to the periodic reporting requirements under Sections 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act;   (b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all
reports and other documents required of Acquiror under the Act and the
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"); and   (c) furnish to

Acquiror Common Stock, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by
Acquiror that it has complied with the reporting requirements of SEC Rule
144, the Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of Acquiror and such other reports and documents so filed by

144 as may be reasonably requested by a Target stockholder.   5.14 ACQUIROR

that approval by its shareholders is not required in connection with the
Merger. If such confirmation is not received, Acquiror will include in the
Registration Statement such information as may be necessary, and shall take
such other action as may be necessary, to cause the Merger to be submitted to
its shareholders for approval. If shareholder approval is required, the
obligations of Acquiror and Target hereunder shall be conditioned on receipt

actual fraud or willful misconduct shall survive indefinitely. The covenants
and agreements of the parties shall survive until the expiration of the

the limitations set forth in this Article IX, the shareholders of Target

and expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes of action,
including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees, net of any recoveries

the representations and warranties made by Target under this Agreement to be
true and accurate at the time which they were made (including, if applicable,
as of the Closing Date) or (ii) any breach or default by Target of any
covenant or agreement made by Target in this Agreement, the Target Disclosure
Schedule or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement and which is required
to be performed by Target at or prior to the Effective Time. The Escrow Fund
shall be the sole security for this indemnity obligation subject to the
limitations in this Agreement.   (b) From and after the Effective Time, and
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, Acquiror will
indemnify and hold harmless Target Shareholders from and against any and all
Damages resulting from any misrepresentation or breach of or default in
connection with any representation, warranty or covenant of Acquiror in this

misrepresentation, breach or default has occurred, any materiality standard
contained in the applicable representation, warranty or covenant shall be
disregarded.   9.3 ESCROW FUND   Subject to Section 9.6, sole and
exclusive security for the indemnity provided for in Section 9.2(a), the
Escrow Shares shall be registered in the name of, and, be deposited with an

Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the "ESCROW
AGENT"), such deposit to constitute an escrow fund to be governed by the
terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement, in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT").   9.4 CERTAIN LIMITATIONS  
(a) Acquiror\'s right to indemnification for Damages under Section 9.2 shall

(the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT") and then only to the extent of any excess Damages
over such $150,000 amount.   -52-  58       (b) No Indemnifying

the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto and
received by the Indemnifying Party on or before 5:00 p.m., Baltimore,
Maryland time on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "EXPIRATION
DATE").   (c) Subject to Section 9.6, the Parties hereby agree that
the maximum liability of a particular shareholder of the Target under this
Article for Damages shall in no event exceed the value of the Acquiror Common
Stock held in escrow for such Target shareholder pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement valued as provided in the Escrow Agreement.   9.5 CERTAIN
PROCEDURAL MATTERS   (a) A party seeking indemnification (the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY") shall give prompt written notice to the party from whom
indemnification will be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of any claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon
as practicable thereafter all information and documentation necessary to
support and verify the claim asserted (or which would be asserted if not
below the Threshold Amount), and the Indemnifying Party and his or its
representatives shall be given access to all personnel, properties, books and
records that the Indemnifying Party reasonably determines to be related
thereto.   (b) If any legal proceeding is instituted or any claim or
demand is asserted by any person in respect of which an Indemnified Party may
seek to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any such legal
proceeding, claim or demand to be made to the Indemnifying Party; provided
that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not reduce or
adversely affect the right of the Indemnified Party to assert a claim for
indemnification hereunder with respect to such legal proceeding, claim or
demand except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby.   (c) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right at any
time, at his or its option and expense, to participate in the defense of any
such legal proceeding, claim or demand (including without limitation the
right to participate in negotiations and settlement discussions). The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate fully with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation and settlement of any such
legal proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnifying Party shall be given
access to all personnel, properties, books and records that the Indemnifying
Party reasonably determines to be related thereto. No such legal proceeding,
claim or demand may be settled or compromised (nor shall any agreement be
entered into or commitment made with respect to any settlement or compromise)
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   9.6 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY   If the Merger is
consummated and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
exhibits hereto to the contrary, recovery from the Escrow Fund pursuant to
the terms set forth in this Article IX shall be the exclusive remedy
available to Acquiror for   -53-  59      Damages under this
Agreement. The limitations contained in this Article IX, however, shall not
limit the liability of any Indemnifying Party with respect to any actual
fraud or willful misconduct of such party.   9.7 RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS;
ARBITRATION   (a) In case an Indemnifying Party shall object to
any indemnification claim or claims by an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30)
days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such claims.   (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party
may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless
the amount of the Damages is at issue pending litigation with a third party,
in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree to
arbitration; and in such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by a single arbitrator. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall jointly select an arbitrator. If the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party fail to agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) days, an
arbitrator shall be selected for them by the American Arbitration Association
("AAA"). The decision of the arbitrator so selected as to the validity and
amount of any indemnification claim shall be binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement.   (c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such
arbitration shall be held in Chicago, Illinois under the commercial rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The Non-Prevailing
Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each
arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association,
and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys\' fees and costs
reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration.   9.8
