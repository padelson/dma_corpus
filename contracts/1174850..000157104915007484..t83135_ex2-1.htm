cause the Baylake Trust to discharge its obligations with respect to the
Baylake Trust Preferred Securities arising after the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreements related to the
Baylake Trust Preferred Securities and the TRUPS Assumption; and (c)
Nicolet and Baylake shall execute and deliver, or cause to be delivered, a
supplemental indenture, in a form satisfactory to the trustee of the Baylake
Trust, to effectuate the TRUPS Assumption, for each Baylake Trust, whereby
Baylake shall assign, and Nicolet shall assume, all of Baylake's covenants,
agreements and obligations under the Baylake Trust Debentures (the
"Supplemental Indentures"), signed by a duly authorized officer of each of
Baylake and Nicolet, and any and all other documentation and consents,
including opinions of counsel, required by the trustee of the Baylake Trust to
make such assumptions effective.

  



  

Section 1.9 _Absence of Control_. Subject to any specific
provisions of this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties to this

influence over the management or policies of such other party or any of its
respective Subsidiaries.

parties may, upon their mutual written agreement, change the method of
effecting the Contemplated Transactions if and to the extent that they
conclude such a change to be desirable; _provided_ , that: (a) any such
change shall not affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger to holders of Baylake Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i)

Article 2 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

  



  

Section 2.1 _Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, Baylake, or the
holder of any shares of Baylake Common Stock and subject to Section 2.3, the
shares of Baylake Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, with respect to each holder of record of such shares, will
be converted into the right to receive: (a) 0.4517 fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Nicolet Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"),
multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Baylake Common Stock held by such
holder of record (such product, the "Merger Consideration"). 

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the contrary, at the
Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Baylake Common
Stock held in Baylake's treasury and each share of Baylake Common Stock owned
directly or indirectly by Nicolet (other than shares held in a fiduciary
capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted) will be canceled
and no shares of Nicolet Common Stock or other consideration will be issued
or paid in exchange therefor. 

  



  

Section 2.2 _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time,
the shares of Baylake Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and
will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. Certificates that
represented Baylake Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock or cash
into which they were converted pursuant to this Article 2.

  



  

Section 2.3 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Nicolet
Common Stock shall be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each
holder of Baylake Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Nicolet Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 shall
instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to
the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying Nicolet Common Stock Price
by the fractional share of Nicolet Common Stock to which such former holder
would otherwise be entitled.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Nicolet Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, Baylake,
or the holder of any shares of Nicolet Common Stock, the shares of Nicolet
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  



  

Section 2.5 _Reserved_.

Section 2.6 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. shall serve, pursuant to customary terms of an exchange
agent agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the
"Exchange Agent"); and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent
agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. Nicolet shall be solely
responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Nicolet shall authorize the
issuance of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Baylake Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this
Article 2: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock for
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, and (ii)
sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Nicolet Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3. Such amount of cash and
shares of Nicolet Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this
Article 2 as the "Conversion Fund."

  



  

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Nicolet
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one
or more certificates representing shares of Baylake Common Stock ("Baylake
Stock Certificates") a letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal") which
specifies, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Baylake Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Baylake Stock Certificates
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Upon proper surrender of a Baylake Stock Certificate for
exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and
duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Baylake Stock
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor his, her or its
Merger Consideration plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Nicolet
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3 deliverable in respect of the
shares of Baylake Common Stock represented by such Baylake Stock Certificate;
thereupon such Baylake Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger Consideration
deliverable upon surrender of a Baylake Stock Certificate.

  



  

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of
Outstanding Baylake Shares on the stock transfer books of Baylake.

  



  

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
Nicolet Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Baylake Stock
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Baylake Stock
Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Promptly after the surrender
of a Baylake Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record
holder

  



    

 | 5|

Execution Copy

  



  

thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable
with respect to shares of Nicolet Common Stock into which the shares of
Baylake Common Stock represented by such Baylake Stock Certificate
were converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1. No holder of
an unsurrendered Baylake Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the
surrender of such Baylake Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Nicolet
Common Stock into which such holder's Baylake Common Stock shall have been
converted. 

  



  

(g) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Baylake twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any stockholders
of Baylake who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest,
for issuance of Nicolet Common stock pursuant to the Merger Consideration and
the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect
of such stockholders' shares of Baylake Common Stock, as well as any accrued
and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Nicolet Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Baylake Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  



  

(h) In the event any Baylake Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Baylake Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Baylake Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Baylake Stock Certificate, and in
accordance with this Article 2, shares of Nicolet Common stock pursuant to
the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(i) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Nicolet Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration per share shall be adjusted
appropriately to provide the holders of Baylake Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Baylake Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each option granted by Baylake to purchase shares of Baylake
Common Stock under a Baylake Stock Plan or

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

otherwise, whether vested or unvested (a "Baylake Stock Option"), that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
adjusted under the Baylake Stock Plan or converted into a substituted option
under a Nicolet stock plan, in either case, so that the number of whole
shares of Nicolet Common Stock subject to such adjusted or substituted option
will be equal to the number of shares of Baylake Common Stock subject to such
Baylake Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise
price per share of Nicolet Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the exercise price for each share of Baylake Common Stock
subject to such Baylake Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by the Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms and conditions of Baylake
Stock Plan, if any, pursuant to which such Baylake Stock Option was granted
and associated award agreement. If Nicolet elects to adjust Baylake Stock
Options rather than provide substituted options, Nicolet shall take any action
necessary to assume sponsorship of the Baylake Stock Plan and the obligations
thereunder. It is intended that the adjustment or substitution, as the case
may be, of Baylake Stock Options under this Section 2.7(a) shall comply with
Sections 409A and 424 of the Code, to the extent applicable, and this Section
2.7(a) shall be construed consistent with such intent.

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each award in respect of a share of Baylake Common Stock
subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a
Baylake Stock Plan or otherwise, including, but not limited to, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, and performance contingent stock (a "Baylake
Restricted Stock Award"), which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be adjusted under the Baylake Stock Plan or converted
into a substitute award under a Nicolet Stock Plan, in either case, so that
the number of whole shares of Nicolet Common Stock that is equal to the number
of shares of Baylake Common Stock subject to such Baylake Equity Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole share), subject to the terms and
conditions of the Baylake Stock Plan, if any, pursuant to which such
Baylake Equity Award was granted and associated award agreement. If Nicolet
elects to adjust Baylake Equity Awards rather than provide substituted
awards, Nicolet shall take any action necessary to assume sponsorship of the
Baylake Stock Plan and the obligations thereunder. It is intended that the
conversion of Baylake Equity Awards under this Section 2.7(b) shall
comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable, and this
Section 2.7(b) shall be construed consistent with such intent.

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Baylake, the Baylake Board
and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.7. Effective as of the Effective Time, Nicolet,
the Nicolet Board and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.7.

other rights obligating Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, sell
or otherwise dispose of, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any
shares of capital stock of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) no
contractual obligations of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Baylake Common Stock or any equity
security of Baylake or its Subsidiaries or any securities representing the
right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of Baylake or its Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by
this Agreement, since Baylake Capitalization Date, no shares of Baylake Common
Stock have been purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, directly or
indirectly, by Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries and no dividends or other
distributions payable in any equity securities of Baylake or any of its
Subsidiaries have been declared, set aside, made or paid to the
stockholders of Baylake. Except as set forth in Section 3.5(d) of the
Baylake Disclosure Schedules, other than its Subsidiaries, Baylake does not

of any Person or any direct or indirect equity or ownership interest in any
other business.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Baylake Subsidiary Capitalization_. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
ownership interests of each Subsidiary of Baylake are owned by Baylake,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any material liens,
pledges, charges, claims and security interests and similar encumbrances, and
all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. No Subsidiary of Baylake has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock
or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Baylake SEC Reports; Financial Statements and
Reports; Regulatory Filings_.

  



  

(a) Baylake has timely filed all Baylake SEC Reports, and all such
Baylake SEC Reports have complied as to form in all material respects, as of
their respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with
all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The
Baylake SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates,
none of the Baylake SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised
by the SEC with

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

respect to any of the Baylake SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Baylake is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by
reference) in the Baylake SEC Reports (including the related notes, where
applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case
as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all
material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the
financial statements presented in the Baylake SEC Reports (collectively, the
"Baylake Financial Statements") are complete and correct in all material
respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position,
assets, liabilities and results of operations of Baylake and its Subsidiaries
at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in Baylake
Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the
case of unaudited Baylake Financial Statements. The Baylake Financial
Statements do not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities,
absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would
render the Baylake Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as
of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. As
of the date hereof, Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP has not resigned (or
informed Baylake that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
registered public accountants of Baylake.

  



  

(c) Baylake is in compliance in all material respects with all of
the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or
any of its Subsidiaries. Baylake maintains a system of disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act
that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by Baylake in reports that Baylake is required to file under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to Baylake's management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. As of June 30, 2015, to the
Knowledge of Baylake, such controls and procedures were effective, in all
material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

  



  

(d) Baylake and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and
maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the
meaning of Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) ("Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting"). Baylake's certifying officers have
evaluated the effectiveness of Baylake's Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed
quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Baylake under the Exchange Act (the "Baylake
Evaluation Date"). Baylake presented in such quarterly report the conclusions
of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of Baylake's Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Baylake
Evaluation Date. Since the Baylake Evaluation Date, there have been no
changes in Baylake's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
Baylake's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Baylake has devised and
maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences.

  



  

(e) Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2013, with all
applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the
extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Baylake and its
Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed
prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date.

  



  

(f) Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory
Authority in the Ordinary Course of Business of Baylake and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Authority has initiated since January 1, 2013, or
has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or to the Knowledge of
Baylake, investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of Baylake
or its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2013, no Regulatory Authority has
resolved any proceeding enforcement action or, to the Knowledge of Baylake,
investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of Baylake or its
Subsidiaries. Baylake and its Subsidiaries have fully complied with, and
there is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory
Authority with respect to, any report or statement relating to any
examination or inspection of Baylake or its Subsidiaries. Since January 1,
2013, there have been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or
disputes with, any Regulatory Authority with respect to the business,
operations, policies or procedures of Baylake or its Subsidiaries (other than
normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Authority in Baylake's Ordinary
Course of Business). To the Knowledge of Baylake, there has not been any
event or occurrence since January 1, 2013 that would result in a
determination that Baylake Bank is not an eligible depository institution as
defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r).

  



  

Section 3.8 _Books and Records_. The books of account, minute
books, stock record books and other records of Baylake and its
Subsidiaries are complete and correct in all material respects and have been
maintained in accordance with Baylake's business practices and all applicable
Legal Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of
internal controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of

Section 3.9 _Properties_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.9 of the Baylake Disclosure Schedules lists or
describes all interests in real property owned by Baylake and each of
its Subsidiaries, including OREO, as of the date of this Agreement and the
principal buildings and structures located thereon, together with the address
of such real estate, and each lease of real property to which it is a party,
identifying the parties thereto, the annual rental payable, the expiration
date thereof and a brief description of the property covered, and in each case
of either owned or leased real property, the proper identification, if
applicable, of each such property as a branch or main office or other office.

  



  

(b) Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable
title to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible
or intangible, that it purports to own, subject to no liens, mortgages,
security interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind except: (i) as noted
in the most recent Baylake Financial Statements; (ii) statutory liens for
Taxes not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate
Proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established and
reflected in the Baylake Financial Statements; (iii) pledges or liens
required to be granted in connection with the acceptance of government
deposits, granted in connection with repurchase or reverse repurchase
agreements or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business; (iv)
easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not
materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
properties; and (v) minor defects and irregularities in title and
encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes
for which they are held (collectively, the "Baylake Permitted Exceptions").
Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under valid and
existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the
respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without
default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of Baylake, the lessor.
All buildings and structures owned by Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries
lie wholly within the boundaries of the real property owned or validly leased
by it, and do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with
the property rights of, any other Person.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_.

  



  

(a) Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing
agreement by Baylake Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty,
renewal or extension thereof (the "Baylake Loans") reflected as an asset on
any of the Baylake Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory
Authorities is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally
sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of
Baylake, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named
therein, enforceable in accordance with

  



    

 | 14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or
equitable principles or doctrines.

  



  

(b) All Baylake Loans originated or purchased by Baylake Bank were
made or purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of
directors of Baylake Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of Baylake
Bank. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Baylake Disclosure
Schedules, Baylake Bank's interest in all Baylake Loans is free and clear of
any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other charge, and Baylake Bank
has complied in all material respects with all Legal Requirements relating to
such Baylake Loans. There has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver
of, in whole or in part, any Baylake Loan made to an executive officer or
director of Baylake Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer or
director during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(c) of the Baylake Disclosure
Schedules, as of the date of this Agreement, Baylake Bank is not a party to
any Baylake Loan: (i) under the terms of which the obligor is more than
ninety (90) days delinquent in payment of principal or interest or in default
of any other material provision as of the dates shown thereon or for which
Baylake Bank has discontinued the accrual of interest; (ii) that has been
classified as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss," "other loans especially
mentioned" or any comparable classifications by Baylake Bank; (iii) that has
been listed on any "watch list" or similar internal report of Baylake Bank;
(iv) that has been the subject of any notice from any obligor of adverse
environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of any collateral for
such Baylake Loan; (v) with respect to which Baylake Bank has Knowledge of
potential violations of any Environmental Laws that may have occurred on the
property serving as collateral for such Baylake Loan or by any obligor of such
Baylake Loan; or (vi) that represents an extension of credit to an executive
officer or director of Baylake Bank or an entity controlled by an executive
officer or director.

  



  

(d) Baylake Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in
Baylake Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on
the basis of Baylake Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio
of Baylake Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was
established in a manner consistent with Baylake Bank's internal policies, and,
in the reasonable judgment of Baylake Bank, was adequate in all material
respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide
for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Baylake Loans
previously charged-off, on outstanding Baylake Loans.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Taxes_.

Subsidiaries have paid, or made adequate provision for the payment of, all

upon any of the assets of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of
Baylake, threatened against Baylake and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that
they owe. No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or
payable by Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being conducted
or, to the Knowledge of Baylake, threatened by any Regulatory Authority.
Neither Baylake nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return, and there are no liens for Taxes
(other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of Baylake's or its
Subsidiaries' assets. Neither Baylake nor its Subsidiaries has executed an
extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or
collection of any Tax that is currently in effect.

  



  

(c) Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries have delivered or made
available to Nicolet true, correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns
relating to income taxes and franchise taxes owed by Baylake and its
Subsidiaries with respect to the last two (2) fiscal years.

  



  

(d) To the Knowledge of Baylake, Baylake and each of its
Subsidiaries have not engaged in any transaction that could affect the Tax
liability for any Tax Returns not closed by applicable statute of
limitations: (i) which is a "reportable transaction" or a "listed
transaction" or (ii) a "significant purpose of which is the avoidance or
evasion of U.S. federal income tax" within the meaning of Sections 6662,
6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of the Code or of the regulations of the
U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated thereunder or pursuant to notices
or other guidance published by the IRS (irrespective of the effective dates).

  



  

(e) Baylake operates at least one historic business line, or owns at
least a significant portion of its historic business assets, in each

Execution Copy

  



  

Baylake Benefit Plans, as required by applicable law, or describing Baylake
Benefit Plan design changes or describing opportunities to enroll in
Baylake Benefit Plans; (ii) to the extent applicable, the last two (2) years'
annual reports on Form 5500, including all schedules thereto and the opinions
of independent accountants; and (iii) other material ancillary documents,
including:

  



  

(i) all contracts with third party administrators, actuaries,
investment managers, consultants, insurers, and independent contractors;

  



  

(ii) all notices and other communications that were given by Baylake,
any Subsidiary, or any Baylake Benefit Plan to the IRS, the DOL or the PBGC
pursuant to applicable law within the six (6) years preceding the date of this
Agreement; and

  



  

(iii) all notices or other communications that were given by the IRS,
the PBGC, or the DOL to Baylake, any Subsidiary, or any Baylake Benefit Plan
within the six (6) years preceding the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(b) of the Baylake Disclosure
Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible
terminations of employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment,
vesting, increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under
any Baylake Benefit Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of Baylake
or any Subsidiary under any Baylake Benefit Plan as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section
3.12(b) of the Baylake Disclosure Schedules, no Baylake Benefit Plan provides
for payment of any amount which, considered in the aggregate with amounts
payable pursuant to all other Baylake Benefit Plans, would result in any
amount being non-deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of
Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(c) of the Baylake Disclosure
Schedules, neither Baylake nor any of the Baylake ERISA Affiliates sponsors,
maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained,
administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any liability
with respect to, (i) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA), (ii) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (iii) any self-insured plan (including any plan
pursuant to which a stop loss policy or contract applies). With respect to
any Baylake Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in
Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional
employer organization, such Baylake Benefit Plan complies in all respects with
the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither Baylake nor any of the
Baylake ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or
remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled
individuals. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(c) of the Baylake
Disclosure Schedules, neither Baylake nor any of the Baylake ERISA Affiliates

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored,
maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any
liability with respect to, any Baylake Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any tax-qualified
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). No Baylake
Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued
liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

  



  

(d) Each Baylake Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under
Section 401 and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS to the effect that it is so
qualified under the Code and that its related funding instrument is tax
exempt under Section 501 of the Code (or Baylake and its Subsidiaries are
otherwise relying on an opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and,
to Baylake's Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would
adversely affect the qualified status of any Baylake Benefit Plan or the tax-
exempt status of any related trust.

  



  

(e) Each Baylake Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all
material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

  



  

(f) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary
Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending
or, to Baylake's Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any
Baylake Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other
fiduciaries of any Baylake Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable
state or federal law or violation of any Baylake Benefit Plan document or
related agreement.

  



  

(g) No Baylake Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or
has had, any liability to any Baylake Benefit Plan participant,
beneficiary or any other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other
applicable law by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with
any Baylake Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment
of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any
credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights. To Baylake's
Knowledge, no party in interest (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of
any Baylake Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited
transaction (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

  



  

(h) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by
Baylake or any Subsidiary to any Baylake Benefit Plan (i) through the
date hereof have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been
set aside therefor and reflected in Baylake Financial Statements and (ii)
through the Closing Date will have been made or reserves adequate for such
purposes will have been set aside therefore and reflected in Baylake
Financial Statements.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(i) of the Baylake Disclosure
Schedules, there are no obligations under any Baylake Benefit Plans to
provide health or other welfare

benefits to retirees or other former employees, directors, consultants or
their dependents (other than rights under Section 4980B of the Code or Section
601 of ERISA or comparable state laws).

  



  

(j) No condition exists as a result of which Baylake or any
Subsidiary would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent,
under any Baylake Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a
person performing services for Baylake or any Subsidiary as an independent
contractor rather than as an employee. All individuals participating in
Baylake Benefit Plans are in fact eligible and authorized to participate in
such Baylake Benefit Plan. 

  



  

(k) Neither Baylake nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities
to employees or former employees that are not reflected in the
Baylake Benefit Plans.

  



  

Section 3.13 _Compliance with Legal Requirements_. Baylake and
each of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates,
permits, franchises and rights from all appropriate Regulatory Authorities
necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses. Baylake and each

or written) from any Regulatory Authority or any other Person regarding: (a)
any actual, alleged, possible, or potential violation of, or failure to
comply with, any Legal Requirement; or (b) any actual, alleged, possible, or
potential obligation on the part of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries to

Requirement.

Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order that prohibits such
officer, director, employee or agent from engaging in or continuing any
conduct, activity or practice relating to the businesses of Baylake or any of
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

Baylake, none of the foregoing has been threatened by any Regulatory
Authority.

respect to contractual performance extended by Baylake or any of its
Subsidiaries other than in the Ordinary Course of Business;

  



  

(p) each Baylake Benefit Plan (other than those described in Section
3.16(k)); and

  



  

(q) each amendment, supplement and modification in respect of any of
the foregoing.

  



  

Section 3.17 _No Defaults_. Each Baylake Material Contract is in
full force and effect and is valid and enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other Legal Requirements affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity. To the Knowledge of
Baylake, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without
notice or lapse of time) may contravene, conflict with or result in a
material violation or breach of, or give Baylake, any of its Subsidiaries or
other Person the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy under, or
to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or to cancel, terminate or
modify, any Baylake Material Contract. Except in the Ordinary Course of
Business with respect to any Baylake Loan, neither Baylake nor any of
its Subsidiaries has given to or received from any other Person, at any time
since January 1, 2013, any notice or other communication (whether oral or
written) regarding any actual, alleged, possible or potential violation or
breach of, or default under, any Baylake Material Contract, that has not been
terminated or satisfied prior to the date of this Agreement. Other than in
the Ordinary Course of Business, there are no renegotiations of, attempts to
renegotiate or outstanding rights to renegotiate, any material amounts paid

payable to Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries under current or completed
Baylake Material Contracts with any Person, and no such Person has made
written demand for such renegotiation.

  



  

Section 3.18 _Insurance_. Section 3.18 of the Baylake Disclosure
Schedules lists all insurance policies and bonds owned or held as of the date
of this Agreement by Baylake and its Subsidiaries with respect to their
respective business, operations, properties or assets (including
bankers' blanket bond and insurance providing benefits for employees), true,
complete and correct copies of each of which have been delivered or made
available to Nicolet. Baylake and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of Baylake
reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with industry practice.
Baylake and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with
their insurance policies and are not in default under any of the terms
thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of Baylake and its Subsidiaries, Baylake or the
relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficiary of such policies. All
premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all
claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. Section 3.18 of
the Baylake Disclosure Schedules lists and briefly describes all claims that
have been filed under such insurance policies and bonds within the past
two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement that individually or in the
aggregate exceed $250,000 and the current status of such claims. All such
claims have been filed in due and timely fashion. None of Baylake or any of
its Subsidiaries has had any insurance policy or bond cancelled or nonrenewed
by the issuer of the policy or bond within the past two (2) years.

  



  

Section 3.19 _Compliance with Environmental Laws_. There are no
actions, suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders
involving Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets
that are pending or, to the Knowledge of Baylake, threatened, nor to the
Knowledge of Baylake, is there any factual basis for any of the foregoing, as
a result of any asserted failure of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries of, or
any predecessor thereof, to comply with any Environmental Law.
No environmental clearances or other governmental approvals are required for
the conduct of the business of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries or the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Except as set forth in Section
3.19 of the Baylake Disclosure Schedules, to the Knowledge of Baylake,
neither Baylake nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any interest in
real estate on which any substances have been generated, used, stored,
deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which substances if known to be
present on, at or under such property, would require notification to any
Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other remedial action under
any Environmental Law at such property or any impacted adjacent or down
gradient property. Baylake and each Subsidiary of Baylake has complied in
all material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to it and its
business operations.

  



  

Section 3.20 _Transactions with Affiliates_. Since January 1,
2013, all transactions required to be disclosed by Baylake pursuant to

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

the Securities Act have been disclosed in Baylake SEC Reports. No
transaction, or series of related transactions, is currently proposed by
Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Baylake, by any
other Person, to which Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries would be a
participant that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act if consummated.

  



  

Section 3.21 _Brokers; Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Except for
fees payable to Sandler O'Neill and Partners, L.P. pursuant to an
engagement letter that has been Previously Disclosed, none of Baylake or its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, has incurred any
obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders'
fees or agents' commissions or other similar payment in connection with this
Agreement. The Baylake Board has received the opinion of Sandler O'Neill and
Partners, L.P., to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based
upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of Baylake Common Stock in
connection with the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Baylake Common Stock.

  



  

Section 3.22 _Approval Delays_. To the Knowledge of Baylake, there
is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals
would be denied or unduly delayed. Baylake Bank's most recent CRA rating was
"satisfactory" or better.

  



  

Section 3.23 _Labor Matters_.

  



  

(a) There are no collective bargaining agreements or other labor
union Contracts applicable to any employees of Baylake or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout,
or, to the Knowledge of Baylake, threat thereof, by or with respect to any
employees of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries, and there has been no labor
dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout in the previous three (3) years.
There are no organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a
collective bargaining unit presently being made, or to the Knowledge of
Baylake, threatened, involving employees of Baylake or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Baylake nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged or is
engaging in any unfair labor practice. Baylake and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health. No
Proceeding asserting that Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an
unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act
of 1935) or seeking to compel Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain
with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Baylake, threatened with respect to Baylake or
any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Regulatory Authority.

  



  

(b) Neither Baylake nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any
Regulatory Authority relating to

  



    

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

employees or employment practices. None of Baylake, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of its or their executive officers has received within the past
three (3) years any written notice of intent by any Regulatory Authority
responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment laws to conduct an
investigation relating to Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the
Knowledge of Baylake, no such investigation is in progress.

  



  

Section 3.24 _Intellectual Property_. Each of Baylake and its
Subsidiaries has the unrestricted right and authority, and the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries will have the unrestricted right and authority
from and after the Effective Time, to use all patents,
trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade names or other intellectual
property owned by them as is necessary to enable them to conduct and to
continue to conduct all material phases of the businesses of Baylake and its
Subsidiaries in the manner presently conducted by them, and, to the Knowledge
of Baylake, such use does not, and will not, conflict with, infringe on or
violate any patent, trademark, copyright, service mark, trade name or any
other intellectual property right of any Person.

  



  

Section 3.25 _Investments_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.25(a) of the Baylake Disclosure Schedules includes a
complete and correct list and description as of June 30, 2015, of: (i) all
investment and debt securities, mortgage-backed and related securities,
marketable equity securities and securities purchased under agreements to
resell that are owned by Baylake or its Subsidiaries, other than, with respect
to Baylake Bank, in a fiduciary or agency capacity (the "Baylake Investment
Securities"); and (ii) any such Baylake Investment Securities that are
pledged as collateral to another Person. Baylake and each Subsidiary has good
and marketable title to all Baylake Investment Securities held by it, free
and clear of any liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or
charges, except for Baylake Permitted Exceptions and except to the extent
such Baylake Investment Securities are pledged in the Ordinary Course
of Business consistent with prudent banking practices to secure obligations
of Baylake or Baylake Bank. The Baylake Investment Securities are valued on
the books of Baylake and Baylake Bank in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.25(b) of the Baylake Disclosure
Schedules and as may be imposed by applicable securities laws and
restrictions that may exist for securities that are classified as "held to
maturity," none of the Baylake Investment Securities is subject to any
restriction, whether contractual or statutory, that materially impairs the
ability of Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of such investment
at any time. With respect to all material repurchase agreements to which
Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, Baylake or such Subsidiary of
Baylake, as the case may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security
interest in the securities or other collateral securing each such repurchase
agreement, and the value of the collateral securing each such repurchase
agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured by such collateral
under such agreement.

Execution Copy

  



  

(c) None of Baylake or its Subsidiaries has sold or otherwise
disposed of any Baylake Investment Securities in a transaction in which
the acquiror of such Baylake Investment Securities or other person has the
right, either conditionally or absolutely, to require Baylake or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase or otherwise reacquire any such Baylake Investment
Securities.

  



  

(d) There are no interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option
agreements or other interest rate risk management arrangements (other than
loan caps or floors contained within Baylake Loans entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business) to which Baylake or its Subsidiaries is bound.

  



  

Section 3.26 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Baylake has performed,
or has caused Baylake Trust to perform, all of the obligations required to be
performed by it and is not in default under the terms of the Baylake Trust
Debentures or the Baylake Trust Preferred Securities or any agreements
related thereto.

  



  

Section 3.27 _Waiver of Vesting_. As of the date of this
Agreement, Baylake has received executed waivers, in the form of Exhibit B,
from each Baylake employee set forth on Schedule 2 waiving any acceleration
of vesting of any outstanding Baylake Equity Awards resulting from the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Nicolet, and the
consummation by it of its obligations under this Agreement, have been
authorized by all necessary corporate action, subject to Nicolet Stockholder
Approval, and, subject to the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals,
this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Nicolet
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Legal Requirements
affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity.

this Agreement nor the consummation or performance of any of the
Contemplated Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or without
notice or lapse of time): (a) contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, certificate of
formation or charter (or similar organizational documents) or bylaws or

effective resolution adopted by the board of directors, stockholders, manager
or members of, Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries; (b) assuming receipt of

Regulatory Approvals, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of,
or give any Regulatory Authority or other Person the valid and

claims and security interests and similar encumbrances, and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (except as provided in 12 U.S.C. § 55) and
free of preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of Nicolet has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements
of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of
capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Nicolet SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports;
Regulatory Filings_.

  



  

(a) Nicolet has timely filed all Nicolet SEC Reports, and all such
Nicolet SEC Reports have complied as to form in all material respects, as of
their respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with
all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The
Nicolet SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates,
none of the Nicolet SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof,
there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC
with respect to any of the Nicolet SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Nicolet is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by
reference) in the Nicolet SEC Reports (including the related notes, where
applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case
as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all
material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the
financial statements presented in the Nicolet SEC Reports (collectively, the
"Nicolet Financial Statements") are complete and correct in all material
respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position,
assets, liabilities and results of operations of Nicolet and its Subsidiaries
at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Nicolet
Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the
case of unaudited Nicolet Financial Statements. The Nicolet Financial
Statements do not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities,
absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would
render the Nicolet Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as
of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. As
of the date hereof, Porter Keadle Moore, LLC has not resigned (or informed
Nicolet that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
registered public accountants of Nicolet.

  



    

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

(c) Nicolet is in compliance in all material respects with all of
the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or
any of its Subsidiaries. Nicolet maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by Nicolet in reports that Nicolet is required to file under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to Nicolet's management to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of June 30, 2015, to the
Knowledge of Nicolet, such controls and procedures were effective, in all
material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

  



  

(d) Nicolet and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and
maintained a system of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Nicolet's certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of Nicolet's
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered
by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Nicolet under the
Exchange Act (the "Nicolet Evaluation Date"). Nicolet presented in such
quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the
effectiveness of Nicolet's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on
their evaluations as of the Nicolet Evaluation Date. Since the Nicolet
Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in Nicolet's Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, Nicolet's Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Nicolet has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

  



  

(e) Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2013, with all
applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the
extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Nicolet and its
Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed
prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date.

  



  

(f) Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory
Authority in the Ordinary Course of Business of Nicolet and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Authority has

  



    

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

initiated since January 1, 2013, or has pending any proceeding, enforcement
action or to the Knowledge of Nicolet, investigation into the business,
disclosures or operations of Nicolet or its Subsidiaries. Since January 1,
2013, no Regulatory Authority has resolved any proceeding enforcement action
or, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, investigation into the business, disclosures
or operations of Nicolet or its Subsidiaries. Nicolet and its Subsidiaries
have fully complied with, and there is no unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by any Regulatory Authority with respect to, any report or
statement relating to any examination or inspection of Nicolet or its
Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2013, there have been no formal or informal
inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory
Authority with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of
Nicolet or its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations conducted by a
Regulatory Authority in Nicolet's Ordinary Course of Business). To the
Knowledge of Nicolet, there has not been any event or occurrence since
January 1, 2013 that would result in a determination that Nicolet Bank is not
an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r).

  



  

Section 4.8 _Books and Records_. The books of account, minute
books, stock record books and other records of Nicolet and its Subsidiaries
are complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in
accordance with Nicolet's business practices and all applicable Legal
Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal
controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of Nicolet
and each of its Subsidiaries contain accurate and complete records in all
material respects of all meetings held of, and corporate action taken by, its
respective stockholders, boards of directors and committees of the boards of
directors. At the Closing, all of those books and records will be in the
possession of Nicolet and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 4.9 _Properties_.

  



  

(a) Section 4.9 of the Nicolet Disclosure Schedules lists or
describes all interests in real property owned by Nicolet and each of
its Subsidiaries, including OREO as of the date of this Agreement, and the
principal buildings and structures located thereon, together with the address
of such real estate, and each lease of real property to which it is a party,
identifying the parties thereto, the annual rental payable, the expiration
date thereof and a brief description of the property covered, and in each case
of either owned or leased real property, the proper identification, if
applicable, of each such property as a branch or main office or other office.

  



  

(b) Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable
title to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible
or intangible, that it purports to own, subject to no liens, mortgages,
security interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind except: (i) as noted
in the most recent Nicolet Financial Statements; (ii) statutory liens for
Taxes not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate
Proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established and
reflected in the Nicolet Financial Statements; (iii) pledges or

liens required to be granted in connection with the acceptance of government
deposits, granted in connection with repurchase or reverse repurchase
agreements or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business; (iv)
easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not
materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
properties; and (v) minor defects and irregularities in title and encumbrances
that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they
are held (collectively, the "Nicolet Permitted Exceptions"). Nicolet and each
of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under valid and existing leases to
occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the respective property
leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without default thereunder by
the lessee or, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, the lessor. All buildings and
structures owned by Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries lie wholly within
the boundaries of the real property owned or validly leased by it, and do not
encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights
of, any other Person.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_.

  



  

(a) Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing
agreement by Nicolet Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty,
renewal or extension thereof (the "Nicolet Loans") reflected as an asset on
any of the Nicolet Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory
Authorities is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally
sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of
Nicolet, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named
therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or
equitable principles or doctrines.

  



  

(b) All Nicolet Loans originated or purchased by Nicolet Bank were
made or purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of
directors of Nicolet Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of Nicolet
Bank. Except as set forth in Section 4.10(b) of the Nicolet Disclosure
Schedules, Nicolet Bank's interest in all Nicolet Loans is free and clear of
any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other charge, and Nicolet Bank
has complied in all material respects with all Legal Requirements relating to
such Nicolet Loans. There has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver
of, in whole or in part, any Nicolet Loan made to an executive officer
or director of Nicolet Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer
or director during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(c) of the Nicolet Disclosure
Schedules, as of the date of this Agreement, Nicolet Bank is not a party to
any Nicolet Loan: (i) under the terms of which the obligor is more than ninety
(90) days delinquent in payment of principal or interest or in default of any
other material provision as of the dates shown thereon or for which Nicolet
Bank has discontinued the accrual of interest; (ii) that has been classified
as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss," "other loans especially mentioned" or
any comparable

  



    

 | 35|

Execution Copy

  



  

classifications by Nicolet Bank; (iii) that has been listed on any "watch
list" or similar internal report of Nicolet Bank; (iv) that has been the
subject of any notice from any obligor of adverse environmental conditions
potentially affecting the value of any collateral for such Nicolet Loan; (v)
with respect to which Nicolet Bank has Knowledge of potential violations of
any Environmental Laws that may have occurred on the property serving as
collateral for such Nicolet Loan or by any obligor of such Nicolet Loan; or
(vi) that represents an extension of credit to an executive officer or
director of Nicolet Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer or
director.

  



  

(d) Nicolet Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in
the Nicolet Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined
on the basis of Nicolet Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the
portfolio of Nicolet Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal
Requirements, was established in a manner consistent with Nicolet Bank's
internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of Nicolet Bank, was
adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal
Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries
relating to Nicolet Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding Nicolet
Loans.

  



  

Section 4.11 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed
all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on or before the Closing
Date for all taxable or reporting periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, and each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries have paid, or made adequate
provision for the payment of, all Taxes (whether or not reflected in Tax
Returns as filed or to be filed) due and payable by Nicolet and each of its
Subsidiaries, or claimed to be due and payable by any Regulatory Authority,
and are not delinquent in the payment of any Tax, except such Taxes as are
being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been
provided. There are no liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of Nicolet or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of
Nicolet, threatened against Nicolet and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that
they owe. No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or
payable by Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being conducted
or, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, threatened by any Regulatory Authority.
Neither Nicolet nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return, and there are no liens for Taxes
(other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of Nicolet's or its
Subsidiaries' assets. Neither Nicolet nor its Subsidiaries have executed an
extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or
collection of any Tax that is currently in effect.

Subsidiaries with respect to the last two (2) fiscal years.

  



  

(d) To the Knowledge of Nicolet, Nicolet and each of its
Subsidiaries have not engaged in any transaction that could affect the Tax
liability for any Tax Returns not closed by applicable statute of
limitations: (i) which is a "reportable transaction" or a "listed
transaction" or (ii) a "significant purpose of which is the avoidance or
evasion of U.S. federal income tax" within the meaning of Sections 6662,
6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of the Code or of the regulations of the
U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated thereunder or pursuant to notices
or other guidance published by the IRS (irrespective of the effective dates).

  



  

(e) It is the present intention of Nicolet to continue at least one
significant historic business line of Baylake, or to use at least a
significant portion of Baylake\'s historic business assets in a business, in
each case within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d).

  



  

Section 4.12 _Employee Benefits_.

complete and correct list of each Nicolet Benefit Plan. Nicolet has delivered
to Baylake true and complete copies of the following with respect to each
Nicolet Benefit Plan: (i) copies of each Nicolet Benefit Plan (including a
written description when no formal plan document exists), and all related plan
descriptions and other written communications provided to participants of the
Nicolet Benefit Plans, as required by applicable law, or describing Nicolet
Benefit Plan design changes or describing opportunities to enroll in Nicolet
Benefit Plans; (ii) to the extent applicable, the last two (2) years' annual
reports on Form 5500, including all schedules thereto and the opinions of
independent accountants; and (iii) other material ancillary documents,
including:

  



  

(i) all contracts with third party administrators, actuaries,
investment managers, consultants, insurers, and independent contractors;

  



  

(ii) all notices and other communications that were given by Nicolet,
any Subsidiary, or any Nicolet Benefit Plan to the IRS, the DOL or the PBGC
pursuant to applicable law within the six (6) years preceding the date of this
Agreement; and

  



  

(iii) all notices or other communications that were given by the IRS,
the PBGC, or the DOL to Nicolet, any Subsidiary, or any Nicolet Benefit Plan
within the six (6) years preceding the date of this Agreement.

Execution Copy

  



  

contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of employment in
connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or acceleration
of benefits or benefit entitlements under any Nicolet Benefit Plan or any
other increase in the liabilities of Nicolet or any Subsidiary under any
Nicolet Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 4.12(b) of the Nicolet Disclosure
Schedules, no Nicolet Benefit Plan provides for payment of any amount which,
considered in the aggregate with amounts payable pursuant to all other
Nicolet Benefit Plans, would result in any amount being non-deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(c) of the Nicolet Disclosure
Schedules, neither Nicolet nor any of the Nicolet ERISA Affiliates sponsors,
maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained,
administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any liability
with respect to, (i) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA), (ii) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (iii) any self-insured plan (including any plan
pursuant to which a stop loss policy or contract applies). With respect to any
Nicolet Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in
Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a
professional employer organization, such Nicolet Benefit Plan complies in all
respects with the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither Nicolet nor
any of the Nicolet ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment
and/or remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of
enrolled individuals. Except as set forth in Section 4.12(c) of the Nicolet
Disclosure Schedules, neither Nicolet nor any of the Nicolet ERISA Affiliates
sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored,
maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any
liability with respect to, any Nicolet Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any tax-qualified
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). No Nicolet
Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued
liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

  



  

(d) Each Nicolet Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under
Section 401 and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS to the effect that it is so
qualified under the Code and that its related funding instrument is tax
exempt under Section 501 of the Code (or Nicolet and its Subsidiaries are
otherwise relying on an opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and,
to Nicolet's Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would
adversely affect the qualified status of any Nicolet Benefit Plan or the tax-
exempt status of any related trust.

  



  

(e) Each Nicolet Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all
material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

  



  

(f) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary
Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending
or, to Nicolet's Knowledge,

threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Nicolet Benefit Plan or against
the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Nicolet Benefit
Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or federal law or violation
of any Nicolet Benefit Plan document or related agreement.

  



  

(g) No Nicolet Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or
has had, any liability to any Nicolet Benefit Plan participant,
beneficiary or any other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other
applicable law by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with
any Nicolet Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment
of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any
credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights. To Nicolet's
Knowledge, no party in interest (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of
any Nicolet Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited
transaction (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

  



  

(h) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by
Nicolet or any Subsidiary to any Nicolet Benefit Plan (i) through the date
hereof have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been set
aside therefor and reflected in the Nicolet Financial Statements and (ii)
through the Closing Date will have been made or reserves adequate for such
purposes will have been set aside therefore and reflected in the Nicolet
Financial Statements.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(i) of the Nicolet Disclosure
Schedules, there are no obligations under any Nicolet Benefit Plans to
provide health or other welfare benefits to retirees or other former
employees, directors, consultants or their dependents (other than rights
under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA or comparable state
laws).

  



  

(j) No condition exists as a result of which Nicolet or any
Subsidiary would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent,
under any Nicolet Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a
person performing services for Nicolet or any Subsidiary as an independent
contractor rather than as an employee. All individuals participating in the
Nicolet Benefit Plans are in fact eligible and authorized to participate in
such Nicolet Benefit Plan.

  



  

(k) Neither Nicolet nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities
to employees or former employees that are not reflected in the
Nicolet Benefit Plans.

  



  

Section 4.13 _Compliance with Legal Requirements_. Nicolet and each
of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates, permits,
franchises and rights from all appropriate Regulatory Authorities necessary

Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order that prohibits such

Nicolet, none of the foregoing has been threatened by any Regulatory
Authority.

Section 4.17 _No Defaults_. Each Nicolet Material Contract is in
full force and effect and is valid and enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other Legal Requirements affecting creditors'
rights generally and subject to general principles of equity. To the Knowledge
of Nicolet, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or
without notice or lapse of time) may contravene, conflict with or result in a
material violation or breach of, or give Nicolet, any of its Subsidiaries or
other Person the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy under, or
to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or to cancel, terminate or
modify, any Nicolet Material Contract. Except in the Ordinary Course of
Business with respect to any Nicolet Loan, neither Nicolet nor any of its
Subsidiaries has given to or received from any other Person, at any time
since January 1, 2013, any notice or other communication (whether oral or
written) regarding any actual, alleged, possible or potential violation or
breach of, or default under, any Nicolet Material Contract, that has not been
terminated or satisfied prior to the date of this Agreement. Other than in
the Ordinary Course of Business, there are no renegotiations of, attempts to
renegotiate or outstanding rights to renegotiate, any material amounts paid or
payable to Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries under current or completed
Nicolet Material Contracts with any Person, and no such Person has made
written demand for such renegotiation.

  



  

Section 4.18 _Insurance_.  Section 4.18 of the Nicolet Disclosure
Schedules lists all insurance policies and bonds owned or held as of the date
of this Agreement by Nicolet and its Subsidiaries with respect to their
respective business, operations, properties or assets (including bankers'
blanket bond and insurance providing benefits for employees), true, complete
and correct copies of each of which have been delivered or made available to
Baylake. Nicolet and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers
against such risks and in such amounts as the management of Nicolet
reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with industry
practice. Nicolet and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with their insurance policies and are not in default under any of
the terms thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and
effect and, except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of
officers, directors and employees of Nicolet and its Subsidiaries, Nicolet or
the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficiary of such policies. All
premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all
claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. Section 4.18 of
the Nicolet Disclosure Schedules lists and briefly describes all claims that
have been filed under such insurance policies and bonds within the past two
(2) years prior to the date of this Agreement that individually or in the
aggregate exceed $250,000 and the current status of such claims. All such
claims have been filed in due and timely fashion. None of Nicolet or any of
its Subsidiaries has had any insurance policy or bond cancelled or nonrenewed
by the issuer of the policy or bond within the past two (2) years.

  



  

Section 4.19 _Compliance with Environmental Laws_. There are no
actions, suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders
involving Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets that are pending or, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, threatened, nor to
the Knowledge of Nicolet, is there any factual basis for any of the foregoing,

  



    

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

as a result of any asserted failure of Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries of,
or any predecessor thereof, to comply with any Environmental Law. No
environmental clearances or other governmental approvals are required for the
conduct of the business of Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries or the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. To the Knowledge of Nicolet,
neither Nicolet nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any interest in
real estate on which any substances have been generated, used, stored,
deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which substances if known to be
present on, at or under such property, would require notification to any
Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other remedial action under
any Environmental Law at such property or any impacted adjacent or down
gradient property. Nicolet and each Subsidiary of Nicolet has complied in all
material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to it and its
business operations.

  



  

Section 4.20 _Transactions with Affiliates_. Since January 1, 2013,
all transactions required to be disclosed by Nicolet pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act have been disclosed in the
Nicolet SEC Reports. No transaction, or series of related transactions, is
currently proposed by Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge
of Nicolet, by any other Person, to which Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries
would be a participant that would be required to be disclosed under Item
404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act if consummated.

  



  

Section 4.21 _Brokers; Opinion of Financial Advisor_. None of
Nicolet or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, has
incurred any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage
or finders' fees or agents' commissions or other similar payment in
connection with this Agreement. The Nicolet Board has received the opinion
(which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a
written opinion, dated the same date) of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to
the factors, assumptions, and limitations set forth therein, the Exchange
Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to Nicolet.

  



  

Section 4.22 _Approval Delays_. To the Knowledge of Nicolet, there
is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals
would be denied or unduly delayed. Nicolet Bank's most recent CRA rating was
"satisfactory" or better.

  



  

Section 4.23 _Labor Matters_.

  



  

(a) There are no collective bargaining agreements or other labor
union Contracts applicable to any employees of Nicolet or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout,
or, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, threat thereof, by or with respect to any
employees of Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries, and there has been no labor
dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout in the previous three (3) years.
There are no organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a
collective bargaining unit presently being made, or to the Knowledge of
Nicolet, threatened, involving employees of Nicolet or any

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

of its Subsidiaries. Neither Nicolet nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
or is engaging in any unfair labor practice. Nicolet and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health. No
Proceeding asserting that Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an
unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act
of 1935) or seeking to compel Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain
with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, threatened with respect to Nicolet or
any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Regulatory Authority.

  



  

(b) Neither Nicolet nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any
Regulatory Authority relating to employees or employment practices. None of
Nicolet, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their executive officers
has received within the past three (3) years any written notice of intent by
any Regulatory Authority responsible for the enforcement of labor or
employment laws to conduct an investigation relating to Nicolet or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, no such investigation is in
progress.

  



  

Section 4.24 _Intellectual Property_. Each of Nicolet and its
Subsidiaries has the unrestricted right and authority, and the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries will have the unrestricted right and authority
from and after the Effective Time, to use all patents,
trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade names or other intellectual
property owned by them as is necessary to enable them to conduct and to
continue to conduct all material phases of the businesses of Nicolet and its
Subsidiaries in the manner presently conducted by them, and, to the Knowledge
of Nicolet, such use does not, and will not, conflict with, infringe on or
violate any patent, trademark, copyright, service mark, trade name or any
other intellectual property right of any Person.

  



  

Section 4.25 _Investments_.

  



  

(a) Section 4.25(a) of the Nicolet Disclosure Schedules includes a
complete and correct list and description as of June 30, 2015, of: (i)
all investment and debt securities, mortgage-backed and related securities,
marketable equity securities and securities purchased under agreements to
resell that are owned by Nicolet or its Subsidiaries, other than, with respect
to Nicolet Bank, in a fiduciary or agency capacity (the "Nicolet Investment
Securities"); and (ii) any such Nicolet Investment Securities that are
pledged as collateral to another Person. Nicolet and each Subsidiary has good
and marketable title to all Nicolet Investment Securities held by it, free
and clear of any liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or
charges, except for Nicolet Permitted Exceptions and except to the extent
such Nicolet Investment Securities are pledged in the Ordinary Course of
Business consistent with prudent banking

practices to secure obligations of Nicolet or Nicolet Bank. The Nicolet
Investment Securities are valued on the books of Nicolet and Nicolet Bank in
accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.25(b) of the Nicolet Disclosure
Schedules and as may be imposed by applicable securities laws and
restrictions that may exist for securities that are classified as "held to
maturity," none of the Nicolet Investment Securities is subject to any
restriction, whether contractual or statutory, that materially impairs the
ability of Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of such investment
at any time. With respect to all material repurchase agreements to which
Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, Nicolet or such Subsidiary of
Nicolet, as the case may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security
interest in the securities or other collateral securing each such repurchase
agreement, and the value of the collateral securing each such repurchase
agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured by such collateral
under such agreement.

  



  

(c) None of Nicolet or its Subsidiaries has sold or otherwise
disposed of any Nicolet Investment Securities in a transaction in which
the acquiror of such Nicolet Investment Securities or other person has the
right, either conditionally or absolutely, to require Nicolet or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase or otherwise reacquire any such Nicolet Investment
Securities.

  



  

(d) There are no interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option
agreements or other interest rate risk management arrangements (other than
loan caps or floors contained within Nicolet Loans entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business) to which Nicolet or its Subsidiaries is bound.

  



  

Section 4.26 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Nicolet has performed,
or has caused each Nicolet Trust to perform, all of the obligations
required to be performed by it and is not in default under the terms of the
trust preferred securities issued by the Nicolet Trusts, the subordinated
notes issued by Nicolet to the Nicolet Trusts or any agreements related
thereto.

  



  

Section 4.27 _Waiver of Vesting_. As of the date of this Agreement,
Nicolet has received executed waivers, in the form of Exhibit B, from each
Nicolet employee set forth on Schedule 2 waiving any acceleration of vesting
of any Nicolet Equity Awards resulting from the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Article 5 
 BAYLAKE'S COVENANTS

  



  

Section 5.1 _Access and Investigation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to any applicable Legal Requirement, Nicolet and its
Representatives shall, at all times during normal business hours and
with reasonable advance

  



    

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

notice, have such reasonable access to the facilities, operations, records
and properties of Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 5.1(a) as shall be necessary for the purpose of
determining Baylake's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and preparing for the integration of Nicolet and Baylake
following the Effective Time. Nicolet and its Representatives may, during
such period, make or cause to be made such reasonable investigation of the
operations, records and properties of Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries
and of their respective financial and legal conditions as Nicolet shall deem
necessary or advisable to familiarize itself with such records, properties and
other matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access or investigation
shall not interfere materially with the normal operations of Baylake or any of
its Subsidiaries. Upon request, Baylake and each of its Subsidiaries will
furnish Nicolet or its Representatives attorneys' responses to
auditors' requests for information regarding Baylake or such Subsidiary, as
the case may be, and such financial and operating data and other information
reasonably requested by Nicolet (provided, such disclosure would not result in
the waiver by Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-
client privilege). No investigation by Nicolet or any of its Representatives
shall affect the representations and warranties made by Baylake in this
Agreement. This Section 5.1(a) shall not require the disclosure of any
information to Nicolet the disclosure of which, in Baylake's reasonable
judgment: (i) would be prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement; (ii)
would result in the breach of any agreement with any third party in effect on
the date of this Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened
litigation or investigations, if disclosure might affect the
confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to, the matters being
discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply,
Baylake and Nicolet will make appropriate alternative disclosure arrangements,
including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with any
applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Baylake shall
promptly furnish to Nicolet: (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal and state banking laws or
federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on the
SEC's EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy of each report filed by it
or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other
than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or
examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable
Legal Requirement.

  



  

(c) Baylake shall provide, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to
provide, to Nicolet all information provided to the directors on all
such boards or members of such committees in connection with all meetings of
the board of directors and committees of the board of directors of Baylake or
otherwise provided to the directors or members, and to provide any other
financial reports or other analysis prepared for senior management of Baylake
or its Subsidiaries; in each case other than portions of such documents
relating to confidential

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

supervisory or examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate
any applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

(d) All information obtained by Nicolet in accordance with this
Section 5.1 shall be treated in confidence as provided in that
certain confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement dated June 17, 2015,
between Nicolet and Baylake (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  



  

Section 5.2 _Operation of Baylake and Baylake Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) Except as Previously Disclosed, as expressly contemplated by or
permitted by this Agreement, as required by applicable Legal Requirement, or
with the prior written consent of Nicolet, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, Baylake shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to: (i) conduct its business in the Ordinary Course of Business
in all material respects; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain and preserve intact its business organization and advantageous
business relationships; and (iii) take no action that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay the ability of
Baylake or Nicolet to obtain any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, to
perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

(b) Except as Previously Disclosed, as expressly contemplated by or
permitted by this Agreement, as required by applicable Legal Requirement, or
with the prior written consent of Nicolet, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, Baylake will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to:

Baylake is a party that is outstanding on the date of this Agreement (as
disclosed in Section 5.2(b)(i) of the Baylake Disclosure Schedules): (A)

encumber or pledge, or authorize or propose the creation of, any additional

regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share of Baylake Common Stock
consistent with past practice and (y) pay a special dividend of $0.40 per

(iii) amend the terms of, waive any rights under, terminate, knowingly
violate the terms of or enter into: (A) any Baylake Material Contract (other

presently being conducted; or (C) any Contract or other binding obligation
relating to any class of Baylake Capital Stock or rights associated therewith
or any outstanding instrument of indebtedness;

  



  

(iv) enter into loan transactions not in accordance with, or

than those available to the borrower from competitive sources in arm's-length
transactions;

  



  

(v) (A) enter into any new credit or new lending relationships
greater than $1.0 million that would require an exception to Baylake
Bank's formal loan policy as in effect as of the date of this Agreement or
that are not in strict compliance with the provisions of such loan policy; or
(B) other than incident to a reasonable loan restructuring, extend additional
credit to any Person and any director or officer of, or any owner of a
material interest in, such Person (any of the foregoing with respect to a
Person being referred to as a "Borrowing Affiliate") if such Person or such
Borrowing Affiliate is the obligor under any indebtedness to Baylake or any
of its Subsidiaries which constitutes a nonperforming loan or against any part
of such indebtedness Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries has established loss
reserves or any part of which has been charged-off by Baylake or any of its
Subsidiaries;

  



  

(vi) maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses which is not
adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP to

previously charged off, on Baylake Loans and leases outstanding (including
accrued interest receivable);

  



  

(vii) fail to: (A) charge-off any Baylake Loans or leases that would be
deemed uncollectible in accordance with GAAP or any applicable Legal
Requirement; or (B) place on non-accrual any Baylake Loans or leases that are
past due greater than ninety (90) days;

Ordinary Course of Business and in a transaction that, together with other
such transactions, is not material to Baylake and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole;

of any other entity except in the Ordinary Course of Business and in a
transaction that, together with other such transactions, is not material to

material risk that the Closing Date will be materially delayed or that any
approvals necessary to complete the Merger or the other Contemplated
Transactions will be more difficult to obtain;

(xvii) settle any action, suit, claim or proceeding against it or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for an action, suit, claim or proceeding that is
settled in an amount and for consideration not in excess of $250,000 and that

its Subsidiaries; or (B) create precedent for claims that is reasonably likely

(xviii) except as set forth in Section 5.2(b)(xviii) of the Baylake

(xx) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any

Section 5.3 _Notice of Changes_. Baylake will give prompt notice
to Nicolet of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that: (a)
is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

Baylake's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article 8; _provided, however_ ,
that a failure to comply with this section shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article 8 to be
satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach
would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Article 8 to be satisfied.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Stockholders ' Meeting_. Baylake shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date the Registration Statement is
declared effective, take all action necessary, including as required by and
in accordance with the WBCL, Baylake Articles of Incorporation and
Baylake Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the "Baylake Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Baylake Stockholder Approval. Baylake and Baylake Board will use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the votes in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement required by the WBCL, including by
recommending that its stockholders vote in favor of this Agreement, and
Baylake and Baylake Board will not withdraw, qualify or adversely modify (or
publicly propose or resolve to withdraw, qualify or adversely modify) Baylake
Board's recommendation to Baylake's stockholders that Baylake's stockholders
vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement (an "Adverse
Recommendation"). However, if, prior to the time Baylake Stockholder Approval
is obtained, the Baylake Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
determines in good faith that (a) an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (b) it is reasonably likely that to continue to
recommend this Agreement to its stockholders in light of such Acquisition
Proposal would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under the WBCL,
then, in submitting this Agreement at the Baylake Stockholders' Meeting, the
Baylake Board may make an Adverse Recommendation or publicly propose or
resolve to make an Adverse Recommendation.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Information Provided to Nicolet_. Baylake agrees
that the information concerning Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or to be provided by Baylake in writing to Nicolet specifically for

Section 5.6 _Operating Functions_. Baylake and Baylake Bank shall

efficient and orderly combination of the parties and the operation of Baylake

appropriate operating functions to be effective on upon consummation of the

assistance) in connection with the foregoing, and senior officers of Baylake
and Nicolet shall meet from time to time as Baylake or Nicolet may reasonably
request, to review the financial and operational affairs of Baylake and
Baylake Bank, and Baylake shall give due consideration to Nicolet's input on

associated with any payments due under any Baylake Benefit Plan,

Bank 401(k) Plan so that it ceases, effective as of the close of the plan
year ending December 31, 2015, to be a plan that is intended to satisfy any of
the alternative non-discrimination testing requirements under Section
401(k)(12) or (13) of the Code and also ceases to be a plan that is intended
to satisfy any of the alternative non-discrimination testing requirements
under Section 401(m)(11) or (12) of the Code. Baylake shall not provide any

amendments.

  



  

(d) On or before December 31, 2015, to the extent corrective action
is available, Baylake shall take all available corrective action to remedy
document failures affecting the (i) Deferred Compensation Plan for Selected
Directors of Baylake Bank, (ii) the Baylake Bank Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan and (iii) certain individual deferred compensation, employment
and change in control agreements to which Baylake and/or Baylake Bank are
parties, as identified by Nicolet, by making amendments to such plans and
agreements consistent with IRS correction guidance promulgated under Section

document or operational failures affecting such plans and agreements, Baylake
shall report appropriate amounts deferred under such plans and agreements as
includible in income under Section 409A of the Code for the 2015 calendar year
or earlier calendar years, as appropriate. On a timely basis, but in no event
later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, Baylake shall
complete applicable tax reporting and withholding actions required by
applicable IRS correction guidance or, in the alternative, required with
regard to deferred compensation that fails to satisfy the requirements for
nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code for which
no correction remedy is available.

Section 6.1 _Access and Investigation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to any applicable Legal Requirement, Baylake and its
Representatives shall, at all times during normal business hours and
with reasonable advance notice, have such reasonable access to the
facilities, operations, records and properties of Nicolet and each of its
Subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.1(a) as shall
be necessary for the purpose of determining Nicolet's continued compliance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and preparing for the
integration of Nicolet and Baylake following the Effective Time. Baylake and
its Representatives may, during such period, make or cause to be made
such reasonable investigation of the operations, records and properties of
Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and
legal conditions as Baylake shall deem necessary or advisable to familiarize
itself with such records, properties and other matters; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such access or investigation shall not interfere materially
with the

Execution Copy

  



  

normal operations of Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon request,
Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries will furnish Baylake or its
Representatives attorneys' responses to auditors' requests for information
regarding Nicolet or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such financial
and operating data and other information reasonably requested by Baylake
(provided, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by Nicolet or any
of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege). No
investigation by Baylake or any of its Representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties made by Nicolet in this Agreement. This
Section 6.1(a) shall not require the disclosure of any information to Baylake
the disclosure of which, in Nicolet's reasonable judgment: (i) would be
prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement; (ii) would result in the
breach of any agreement with any third party in effect on the date of this
Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened litigation or
investigations, if disclosure might affect the confidential nature of, or any
privilege relating to, the matters being discussed. If any of
the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply, Nicolet and Baylake
will make appropriate alternative disclosure arrangements, including adopting
additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive
material and to ensure compliance with any applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Nicolet shall
promptly furnish to Baylake: (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal and state banking laws or
federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on the
SEC's EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy of each report filed by it
or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other
than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or
examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable
Legal Requirement.

  



  

(c) Nicolet shall provide, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to
provide, to Baylake all information provided to the directors on all
such boards or members of such committees in connection with all meetings of
the board of directors and committees of the board of directors of Nicolet or
otherwise provided to the directors or members, and to provide any other
financial reports or other analysis prepared for senior management of Nicolet
or its Subsidiaries; in each case other than portions of such documents
relating to confidential supervisory or examination materials or the
disclosure of which would violate any applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

(d) All information obtained by Baylake in accordance with this
Section 6.1 shall be treated in confidence as provided in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

credit to any Person and any Borrowing Affiliate if such Person or such

events and circumstances known to it, to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Nicolet; or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of

WBCL, and in favor of the issuance of Nicolet Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement required by the NASDAQ Rules, including by recommending that
its stockholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and stock issuance, and Nicolet and Nicolet Board will not make an Adverse

obtained, the Nicolet Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
determines in good faith that (a) an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (b) it is reasonably likely that to continue to

Nicolet Board may make an Adverse Recommendation or publicly propose or
resolve to make an Adverse Recommendation.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Information Provided to Baylake_. Nicolet agrees that
the information concerning Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries that is

the Contemplated Transactions will: (a) at the respective times such
documents are filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it
becomes effective and, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, when
mailed, not be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
(b) in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, at the time of Nicolet Stockholders' Meeting, not be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection
with which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be mailed. Nicolet will have a duty
to correct any material misleading statement specified by Nicolet for
inclusion, and so included, in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy
Statement and any other documents filed with any Regulatory Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Nicolet shall have no responsibility for the
truth or accuracy of any information with respect to Baylake or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates contained in the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement or in any document
submitted to, or other communication with, any Regulatory Authority.

cooperate with Baylake and Baylake Bank in connection with planning for the
efficient and orderly combination of the parties and the operation of Nicolet
Bank and Baylake Bank, and in preparing for the consolidation of the banks'
appropriate operating functions to be effective on the Effective Date. Without
limiting the foregoing, Nicolet shall provide office space and support
services (and other reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection
with the foregoing, and senior officers of Nicolet and Baylake shall meet
from time to time as Nicolet or Baylake may reasonably request, to review the
financial and operational affairs of Baylake and Baylake Bank, and Nicolet
shall give due consideration to Baylake's input on such matters, with the

understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this

other Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; (b) neither Nicolet nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that
could reasonably be deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under
federal or state antitrust laws; and (c) neither Nicolet nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any material obligation that is
not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

Proceeding") to which the Indemnified Party was made a party by virtue of his
or her service in any of the capacities set forth above in clauses (1)
through (3) of this Section 6.7(a), to the extent that such Indemnified Party

Subsidiary of Baylake, or the respective shareholders thereof in connection
with a matter in which the Indemnified Party had a material conflict of
interest, (2) a violation of the criminal law, unless the Indemnified Party

as incurred if the Indemnified Party provides Nicolet with all of the
following: (1) a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he
or she did not breach or fail to perform his or her duties to Baylake and (2)
a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay
to Nicolet such reimbursements if and to the extent that it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
for such amounts under the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Upon written request by an Indemnified Employee who has been
made party to an Indemnification Proceeding, Nicolet may reimburse
the Expenses of such Indemnified Employee as incurred if the Indemnified
Employee provides Nicolet with all of the following: (1) a written
affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she did not breach or
fail to perform his or her duties to Baylake or to any Subsidiary of Baylake
and (2) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to
repay to Nicolet such reimbursements if and to the extent that it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Employee was not entitled to
indemnification for such amounts under the terms of this Agreement. Any
determination of whether an Indemnified Employee shall receive
reimbursement for Expenses as such Expenses are incurred pursuant to this
Section 6.7(f) shall be made at the sole and exclusive discretion of Nicolet.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in order
for any Indemnified Party or Indemnified Employee to be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Employee must make a written request to Nicolet. This written request shall
contain a declaration that Nicolet shall have the right to exercise all rights
and remedies available to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Employee
against any other Party arising out of or related to the Indemnification
Proceeding for which indemnification is being sought and that the Indemnified
Party or Indemnified Employee has assigned to Nicolet all such rights and
remedies. Nicolet shall have no obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party
or Indemnified Employee under this Agreement if and to the extent that such
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Employee has previously received
indemnification or allowance for Expenses from any Party in connection with
the same Indemnification Proceeding.

  



  

(h) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time or, if
such term coverage is not available, such other maximum period of
coverage available, Nicolet shall maintain a directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy or policies covering each Indemnified Party and
Indemnified Employee covered by Baylake's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof, on and subject to terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the insureds than Baylake's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof, for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no
event shall Nicolet be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount
in excess of 300% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by Baylake for
fiscal year 2014 for such purpose and, if Nicolet is unable to maintain such
policy (or substitute policy) as a result of this proviso, Nicolet shall
obtain a policy or policies of insurance with substantially

  



    

 | 65|

Execution Copy

  



  

similar terms and conditions as may then be available, and with an equal or
lesser claims reporting time period as may then be available for payment of
such amount; _provided further_ , that in lieu of the obligations of this
subsection, Nicolet may request that Baylake obtain, and upon such
request Baylake shall obtain, such extended reporting period coverage under
Baylake's existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time).

  



  

(i) If Nicolet or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Nicolet shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of
Nicolet assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

  



  

(j) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive consummation of
the Merger and the Bank Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, each Indemnified Employee, his
or her heirs, and his or her legal representatives.

notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its
Subsidiaries with or to any Regulatory Authority in connection with the

the date of this Agreement, Baylake and Nicolet shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and Nicolet shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint Proxy Statement

Contemplated Transactions. Baylake will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Baylake's stockholders, and
Nicolet will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to Nicolet's stockholders, in each case as promptly as

any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of Nicolet Capital Stock issuable in

after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC to amend the
Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. The parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to respond (with the assistance of the other party) as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If prior to the
Effective Time any event occurs with respect to Baylake, Nicolet or any
Subsidiary of Baylake or Nicolet, respectively, or any change occurs
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Baylake or Nicolet,
respectively, for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement that, in each case, is required to be described in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement,
Baylake or Nicolet, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other of such
event, and Baylake or, Nicolet, as applicable, shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and, as required by applicable
Legal Requirements, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to Baylake's stockholders and to Nicolet's
stockholders.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Publicity_.  Neither Baylake nor Nicolet shall, and

Execution Copy

  



  

as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of
nonpublic information to a third party, concerning, the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of Nicolet, in the case of a proposed
announcement, statement or disclosure by Baylake, or Baylake, in the case of
a proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Nicolet;
_provided, however_ , that either party may, without the prior consent of the
other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent
practicable under the circumstances), issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements or by the NASDAQ Rules. Subject to the
foregoing, Nicolet and Baylake agree that the press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of
Nicolet and Baylake, mutually agreed upon by both parties. Thereafter, and
subject to the limitations of this paragraph, Nicolet and Baylake shall
each use their reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions and to ensure that all press
releases and other public statements with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions shall be consistent with such joint communications plan.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation; Takeover
Statutes_. Each of Nicolet and Baylake agrees to exercise good faith and use
its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions
to Closing in this Agreement, and to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions as promptly as practicable. Neither Nicolet nor Baylake will
intentionally take or intentionally permit to be taken any action that would
be a breach of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. Between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, each of Nicolet and Baylake will, and
will cause each Subsidiary of Nicolet and Baylake, respectively, and all of
their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with respect to
all filings that any party is required by any applicable Legal Requirements
to make in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Subject to
applicable Legal Requirements and the instructions of any
Regulatory Authority, each party shall keep the other party reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the Contemplated Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other party
with copies of notices or other written communications received by it or any
of its Subsidiaries from any Regulatory Authority with respect to such
transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, none of Nicolet, Baylake or
their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause
any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Contemplated Transactions
from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any
Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Contemplated Transactions, each party and the members of their respective
Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Contemplated Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
any of the Contemplated Transactions, including, if necessary, challenging
the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

Section 7.5 _Tax Free Reorganization_.

  



  

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of
the Code and that this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated
under the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Effective Time, each of Baylake and Nicolet shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take
any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause
any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither Nicolet nor any
Affiliate of Nicolet knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to be
taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken, which
action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(b) As of the date hereof, Baylake does not know of any reason: (i)
why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to Baylake and counsel to
Nicolet, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in Sections 8.8 and
9.8, certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance
ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications
thereto (the "IRS Guidelines"), to enable counsel to Nicolet and counsel to
Baylake to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8,
respectively, and Baylake hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective
as of the date of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to Baylake would not be
able to deliver the opinion required by Section 9.8. Baylake will deliver
such certificates to counsel to Baylake and counsel to Nicolet.

  



  

(c) As of the date hereof, Nicolet does not know of any reason: (i)
why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to Nicolet and counsel to
Baylake, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in Sections 8.8 and
9.8, certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, to
enable counsel to Nicolet and counsel to Baylake to deliver the legal opinions
contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8, respectively, and Nicolet hereby agrees
to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or
(ii) why counsel to Nicolet would not be able to deliver the opinion required
by Section 8.8. Nicolet will deliver such certificates to counsel to Nicolet
and counsel to Baylake.

  



  

(d) Nicolet will continue at least one significant historic business
line of Baylake, or use at least a significant portion of Baylake\'s
historic business assets in a business, in each case within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d), except that Nicolet may transfer Baylake\'s
historic business assets (i) to a corporation that is a member of Nicolet\'s
"qualified group," within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), or (ii) to a partnership if (A) one or more members of
Nicolet\'s "qualified group" have active and substantial management functions
as a partner with respect to Baylake\'s historic business or (B) members of
Nicolet\'s

"qualified group" in the aggregate own an interest in the partnership
representing a significant interest in Baylake\'s historic business, in
each case within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii).

  



  

Section 7.6 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) All individuals employed by Baylake or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing ("Covered Employees") shall automatically
become employees of Nicolet as of the Closing. Following the Closing, Nicolet
shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly-
situated employees of Nicolet under the Nicolet Benefit Plans; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen Nicolet Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such
time as Nicolet shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Nicolet
Benefit Plans, a Covered Employee's continued participation in Baylake
Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this
sentence (it being understood that participation in the Nicolet Benefit Plans
may commence at different times with respect to each Nicolet Benefit Plan).

  



  

(b) For all purposes (other than purposes of benefit accruals) under
the Nicolet Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the
"New Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with Baylake and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors
to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for
such service under any applicable Baylake Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service.

  



  

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as of the Transition Date, Nicolet shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an
applicable Baylake Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was
participating immediately prior to the Transition Date (such Baylake Benefit
Plans prior to the Transition Date collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision
or similar benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived
for such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such
Covered Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible
expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Execution Copy

  



  

the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account under
such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred during
the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Nicolet shall assume and honor the obligations of Baylake and its
Subsidiaries under all employment, severance, change in control, consulting,
and other similar plans, programs, agreements and arrangements (the
"Severance Plans") in accordance with their terms, without amendment for a
period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing, or longer
following the Closing Date if specifically provided for in such Severance
Plans; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the severance benefits provided to a
terminated Covered Employee shall be determined without taking into
account any reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such Covered
Employee. Nicolet and Baylake hereby agree that the Merger shall only
constitute a "change in control" (or concept of similar import) for purposes
of the Severance Plans, or equity incentive plans, if applicable pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the applicable Severance Plan or equity
incentive plan. Nicolet shall, after consummation of the Merger, pay all
amounts, if and when due, as provided under the Severance Plans, in
accordance with their respective terms, and honor all rights, privileges and
modifications to or with respect to any Severance Plans that become effective
as a result of a change in control or termination of employment.

  



  

(e) Nicolet and Baylake shall determine and establish a retention
bonus program for certain employees of Nicolet and Baylake who remain
employed through the Closing, or at Nicolet for an interim period following
Closing. Baylake and Nicolet shall mutually agree as to each employee
eligible to receive a retention bonus and the amount of each such retention
bonus.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to
cause any disposition of Baylake Capital Stock or Baylake Equity Awards or
conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Baylake
Capital Stock in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) Each of Baylake and Nicolet will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before
the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than Baylake or Nicolet, as
applicable with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Each party will within one (1) Business

Day advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and
the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep the other party apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the material
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a reasonably current
basis.

  



  

(b) Each of Baylake and Nicolet agrees that it will not, and will
cause its respective Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' officers,
directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit,
encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than contacting a Person for the
sole purpose of seeking clarification of the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ that, in the event Baylake or Nicolet
receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, from a Person other
than Baylake or Nicolet, as applicable, after the execution of this Agreement
and prior to the receipt of Baylake Stockholder Approval or Nicolet
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, and the applicable Baylake Board or
Nicolet Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and, after considering the advice of outside
counsel, that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
law, Baylake or Nicolet, as applicable, may: (i) furnish information with
respect to it to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement (subject to the requirement that any such
information not previously provided to Baylake or Nicolet, as applicable,
shall be promptly furnished to Baylake or Nicolet, as applicable); (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; and (iii) terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently enter
into an agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that Baylake or Nicolet may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.8 unless and until (x) five (5) Business Days have elapsed
following the delivery to the other party of a written notice of such
determination by the Baylake Board or the Nicolet Board and, during such five
(5) Business-Day period, the parties cooperate with one another with the
intent of enabling the parties to engage in good faith negotiations so that
the Contemplated Transactions may be effected, and (y) at the end of such
five (5) Business-Day period, Baylake or Nicolet continues, in good faith and
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to
believe that a Superior Proposal continues to exist.

  



  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Baylake or the
Baylake Board or Nicolet or the Nicolet Board from complying with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the
effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Calculation of Tangible Common Equity_. Each of
Baylake and Nicolet shall deliver the calculation of Tangible Common Equity to
the other party, accompanied by

appropriate supporting detail, no later than the close of business on the
fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the Closing Date, and such calculation
shall be subject to verification and approval by the other party and its
independent auditors, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of Baylake and Nicolet
shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the
defense of any shareholder litigation against Baylake or Nicolet, as
applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the
Contemplated Transactions.

representations and warranties of Baylake set forth in this Agreement
(including the representations set forth in Section 3.3 and 3.5(a)) such that
the aggregate effect of such inaccuracies has, or is reasonably likely to
have, a Material Adverse Effect; _provided that_ , for purposes of this
sentence only, those representations and warranties which are qualified by
references to "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or to the
"Knowledge" of any Person shall be deemed not to include such qualifications.

September ___, 2015

  



  

[Bank Holding Company Name]

  

[Bank Holding Company Address]

  

Attn: Chairperson, [Compensation Committee] [Personnel and Compensation
Committee]

  



   | Re:| Waiver of Equity Vesting Rights 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Dear [Name of Chairperson]:

  



  

The purpose of this letter is to document my consent to a waiver of the
opportunity I might otherwise have to obtain accelerated, full vesting of the
equity rights currently outstanding in my favor pursuant to the terms of
those awards previously granted to me under the [Nicolet Bankshares, Inc.
2002 Stock Incentive Plan and/or the Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. 2011 Long Term
Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Plans")] [Baylake Corp. 2010 Equity
Incentive Plan (the "Plan")] (each, an "Award" and, collectively, the
"Awards") in connection with the consummation of those transactions
(collectively, the "Merger Transaction") contemplated by the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated September ___, 2015, between Nicolet Bankshares, Inc.
and Baylake Corp. (the "Merger Agreement").

  



  

Pursuant to terms of the Awards and the underlying Plan[(s)], subject to my
continuing employment, I understand that I would have the opportunity to
become fully vested in all of my equity rights under the Awards upon
consummation of the Merger Transaction.

  



  

By delivery of this letter to you, I hereby waive any right I might otherwise
have to the accelerated vesting of my equity rights under the Awards on
account of the consummation of the Merger Transaction. My waiver is
conditioned upon my understanding that the Awards: (i) will survive the Merger
Transaction[, (ii) will be adjusted in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Merger Agreement,] [(ii)] [(iii)] will thereafter represent
equity rights with respect to shares of the common stock of Nicolet
Bankshares, Inc., and [(iii)] [(iv)] will continue to vest in accordance with
the fixed vesting schedule contained in each of the Awards based upon my
service following the Merger Transaction with Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. and/or
any one or more of its affiliates

  



  

My waiver is further conditioned upon my understanding that I retain the
opportunity to obtain accelerated, full vesting of the equity rights under
each of the Awards upon the occurrence of the first event that may occur
following the Merger Transaction that would trigger the full vesting of

  



    



 



    



  

the Award pursuant to its terms, such determination to be made only after
adjusting appropriately for the changes in circumstances effected by the
Merger Transaction.

  



  

I understand and acknowledge that the waiver evidenced by this letter
enhances my prospects for continuing employment with [Nicolet National Bank]
[Baylake Bank] and that other aspects of the Merger Transaction will be
beneficial to me respecting my future employment and compensation
opportunities with the survivor of the Merger Transaction, Nicolet
Bankshares, Inc. and/or any one or more of its affiliates.

  



  

I am providing this written consent voluntarily, without fear or coercion and
without any promise of continuing employment or the receipt of consideration,
other than that specified above.

  



       | Sincerely, 
---|---

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made the _____ day of
_____________, 201__, to become effective as of the Effective Date (as
hereinafter defined and subject to the contingencies provided for herein), by
and between Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., a bank holding company organized under
the laws of the State of Wisconsin (the " _Employer_ "), and Robert J. Cera, a
resident of the State of Wisconsin (the " _Executive_ ").

  



  

BACKGROUND:

  



  

The Employer is party to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 8,
2015, with Baylake Corp. (" _Baylake_ ") pursuant to which, subject to the
conditions and contingencies set forth therein, Baylake will be merged with
and into the Employer, with the Employer as the surviving entity (the "
_Merger Transaction_ ").

  



  

The Employer and the Executive now desire to enter into this Agreement, which
is to become effective as of the Effective Date, subject to the
consummation of the Merger Transaction on or before September 8, 2016 and the
Executive's continued employment with Baylake through and until the Effective
Date.

  



  

The Employer and the Executive intend that this Agreement embodies the
complete terms and conditions of the Executive's employment with the
Employer and supersedes all prior employment and similar agreements between
the Executive and Baylake and/or the Employer (and/or their Affiliates), as
set forth more specifically below.

  



  

AGREEMENT:

  



  

In consideration of the above premises and the mutual agreements hereinafter
set forth, effective as of the Effective Date, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

1. _Duties_.

  



  

1.1 _Positions_.  The Executive shall be employed as Co-Chief
Executive Officer of the Employer and, subject to the direction of the Board
of Directors, shall perform and discharge faithfully those duties in
connection with the conduct of the Businesses of the Employer for which the
Executive is responsible, as mutually agreed upon between the Executive and
the Executive's counterpart with whom the office of Chief Executive Officer
is being shared; subject to any specific allocation of duties as may be
provided for by the Board of Directors. The duties and responsibilities
assumed by, or assigned to, the Executive shall be commensurate with the
duties and responsibilities associated with similar positions at other
holding companies of community banks of a similar size to the Employer. For
as long as the Executive continues to serve on the Board of Directors, the
Executive also shall serve as its Co-Chairperson.

  



    



 



    



  

1.2 _Full-Time Status_. In addition to the duties and
responsibilities specifically assigned to the Executive pursuant to  _Section
1.1_ hereof, the Executive shall: 

  



  

(a) subject to _Section 1.3_ , devote substantially all of the
Executive's time, energy and skill during regular business hours to the
performance of the duties of the Executive's employment (reasonable vacations
and reasonable absences due to illness excepted) and faithfully and
industriously perform such duties;

  



  

(b) diligently follow and implement all reasonable and lawful
management policies and decisions communicated to the Executive by the Board
of Directors; and

  



  

(c) timely prepare and forward to the Board of Directors all reports
and accountings as reasonably may be requested of the Executive.

  



  

  

1.3 _Permitted Activities_. The Executive shall devote
substantially all of the Executive's entire business time, attention and
energies to the business of the Employer, but as long as the following
activities do not interfere with the Executive's obligations to the Employer,
this shall not be construed as preventing the Executive from:

    



  

(a) investing the Executive's personal assets in any manner which
will not require any services on the part of the Executive in the
operation or affairs of the entity and in which the Executive's participation
is solely that of an investor; provided that such investment activity
following the Effective Date shall not result in the Executive owning
beneficially at any time one percent (1%) or more of the equity securities of
any Competing Business; or

  



  

(b) participating in civic and professional affairs and
organizations and conferences, preparing or publishing papers or books,
teaching or serving on the board of directors of an entity so long as any
such participation does not interfere with the ability of the Executive
to effectively discharge the Executive's duties hereunder; provided further,
that the Board of Directors may direct the Executive in writing to resign
from any such organization and/or cease such activities should the Board of
Directors reasonably conclude that continued membership and/or activities of
the type identified would not be in the best interests of the Employer.

  



  

2. _Term_. This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date and shall remain in effect for the Term. This Agreement shall expire on the last day of the Term, unless extended pursuant to the mutual agreement of the parties on or before the last day of the Term. In the event the Executive continues to provide services to the Employer as an employee following the expiration of the Term, but without entering into a new written employment agreement, such post-expiration of the Term employment shall be deemed to be performed on an "at-will" basis and either party may thereafter terminate such employment with or without notice and for any or no reason and without any obligations determined by reference to this Agreement. In the event the Agreement does not become effective by September 8, 2016, the Agreement shall become null and void upon the close of business on September 8, 2016.

will become vested and exercisable in one-fifth (1/5) annual increments,
commencing on the first anniversary of the Effective Date and continuing for
the next four (4) successive anniversaries until the award is fully vested and
exercisable; provided, however, that the restricted stock award will become

3.7 _Business and Professional Education Expenses; Memberships_.
In accordance with the reimbursement policies from time to time adopted by
the Board of Directors and consistent with the annual budget approved for the
period during which an expense was incurred, the Employer specifically agrees
to reimburse the Executive for reasonable and necessary business expenses
incurred by the Executive in the performance of the Executive's duties
hereunder; provided, however, that the Executive shall, as a condition of
any such reimbursement, submit verification of the nature and amount of such
expenses in accordance with such reimbursement policies and in sufficient
detail to comply with rules and regulations promulgated by the United States
Treasury Department. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, the Employer acknowledges and agrees that reasonable and necessary
business expenses for purposes of this _Section 3.7_ shall include
reimbursement for the cost of the annual dues for membership in a
single country club of which the Executive is a member as of the Effective
Date and the use of an automobile of a make and model determined by the
Employer. The Employer shall pay the expenses associated with the operation,
maintenance, repair and insurance for the automobile. The Executive shall be
responsible for maintaining adequate records of the Executive's personal use
of the automobile and for timely providing the Employer with such records on
an annual basis. In the event of any failure to do so, the Employer
shall report the entire value of the use of the automobile and related
reimbursements as taxable income to the Executive. Except as

compensation hereunder all amounts required to be deducted and withheld in
accordance with applicable federal and state income, FICA and other
withholding requirements. The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that
the Employer's provision of certain in-kind benefits and reimbursements of
expenses will result in income or imputed income for income tax purposes in
accordance with applicable tax laws and that such income or imputed income
also may be subject to tax withholding obligations that may be satisfied by
deductions made from other compensation otherwise payable to the Executive by
the Employer.

Employer under this Agreement. The satisfaction of the obligations in this
_Section 3_ and _Section 4_ shall be subject to any approvals or non-
objections from, and any conditions or restrictions imposed by, any regulator
of the Employer.

  



  

3.12 _Reimbursement of Expenses; In-Kind Benefits_. All expenses
eligible for reimbursements described in this Agreement must be incurred
by the Executive during the Term to be eligible for reimbursement. All in-
kind benefits described in this _Section 3_ must be provided by the Employer
during the Term. The amount of reimbursable expenses incurred, and the amount
of in-kind benefits provided, in one taxable year shall not affect the
expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, in any
other taxable year. Each category of reimbursement shall be paid as soon as
administratively practicable, but in no event shall any such reimbursement be
paid after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in
which the expense was incurred. Neither rights to reimbursement nor in-kind
benefits are subject to liquidation or exchanges for other benefits.

  



  

3.13 _Clawback of Incentive Compensation_. The Executive agrees to
repay any incentive compensation previously paid or otherwise made
available to the Executive under this Agreement that is subject to recovery
under any applicable law (including any rule of any exchange or service
through which the securities of the Employer are then traded), including, but
not limited to, the following circumstances:

  



  

(a) where such compensation was in excess of what should have been
paid or made available because the determination of the amount due was based,
in whole or in part, on materially inaccurate financial information of the
Employer;

  



  

(b) where such compensation constitutes "excessive compensation"
within the meaning of 12 C.F.R. Part 30, Appendix A;

  



  

(c) where the Executive has committed, is substantially responsible
for, or has violated, the respective acts, omissions, conditions, or offenses
outlined under 12 C.F.R. Section 359.4(a)(4); and

  



  

(d) if the Employer becomes, and for so long as the Employer
remains, subject to the provisions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1831o(f), where
such compensation exceeds the restrictions imposed on the senior executive
officers of such an entity.

  



  

The Executive agrees to return promptly any such compensation identified by
the Employer by written notice provided pursuant to _Section 12_. If the
Executive fails to return such compensation promptly, the Executive agrees
that the amount of such compensation may be deducted from any and all other
compensation owed to the Executive by the Employer. If the Executive is then
employed by the Employer, the Executive acknowledges that the Employer may
take appropriate disciplinary action (up to, and including, Termination of
Employment) if the Executive fails to return such compensation. The Executive
acknowledges the Employer's rights to engage in any legal or equitable action
or proceeding in order to enforce the provisions

Board of Directors.

to _Section 4.1(a)(2)_ ; (b) a resignation by the Executive for Good Reason
pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)(2)_ ; (c) death pursuant to _Section 4.1(f)_ ; or

a lump sum on a date determined by the Employer but in no event later than
sixty (60) days following the effective date of the Executive's Termination of
Employment.

  



  

4.3 _Parachute Payments_. In the event shall any payment or other
consideration described in this Agreement exceeds the amount permitted by

timely revoke during any revocation period provided therein, a release in the
form provided by the Employer. The Employer shall provide the release to the
Executive in sufficient time so that if the Executive timely executes and
returns the release, the revocation period will expire no later than sixty
(60) days following the effective date of the Termination of Employment.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary,
to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of tax on the Executive under
Code Section 409A, any payments that are otherwise payable to the Executive
within the first six (6) months following the effective date of Termination
of Employment, shall be suspended and paid as soon as practicable following
the end of the six-month period following such effective date if, immediately
prior to the Executive's Termination of Employment, the Executive is
determined to be a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Code Section
409A(a)(2)(B)(i)) of the Employer (or any related "service recipient" within
the meaning of Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder). Any payments
suspended by operation of the foregoing sentence shall be paid as a lump sum

depository institution controlled by the Employer, but excluding any such
assistance provided to the industry generally, the Employer shall have the
right to terminate all obligations of the Employer under this Agreement as of
the date of such assistance, other than any rights of the Executive that

provided, however, that none of the foregoing obligations shall preclude the

In the event that the Executive is required by law to disclose any Employer

written notice is given to the Employer when the Executive becomes aware that
such disclosure has been requested

Therefore, the Executive agrees and consents that, in addition to all the remedies provided by law or in equity, the Employer shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

and temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent a breach or contemplated
breach of any of the covenants. Furthermore, in addition to any other
remedies, the Executive agrees that any willful violation of the covenants in
_Sections 5 through 8_ that results in material harm to the Employer will
result in the immediate forfeiture of any payment that otherwise is or may
become due under _Section 4.2_. The Employer and the Executive agree that all
remedies available to the Employer shall be cumulative.

  



  

10. _Severability_.  The parties agree that each of the provisions included in this Agreement is separate, distinct and severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and that the invalidity or unenforceability of any Agreement provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

11. _No Set-Off by the Executive_. The existence of any claim, demand, action or cause of action by the Executive against the Employer whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Employer of any of its rights hereunder.

The Executive represents that the Executive is not and, during the Term, will not become a party to any non-competition or non-solicitation agreement or any other agreement which would prohibit the Executive from entering into this Agreement or providing the services for the Employer contemplated by this Agreement on or after the Effective Date. In the event the Executive is subject to any such agreement, this Agreement shall be rendered null and void and the Employer shall have no obligations to the Executive under this Agreement.

  



  

23. _Section 409A_. It is the intent of the parties that any payment to which the Executive is entitled under this Agreement be exempt from Section 409A of the Code to the maximum extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code. However, to the extent any such amounts are considered to be "nonqualified deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall be paid and provided in a manner, and at such time and form, as complies with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code to avoid the unfavorable tax consequences provided therein for non-compliance. Neither the Executive nor the Employer shall intentionally take any action to accelerate or delay the payment of any amounts in any manner which would not be in compliance with Section 409A of the Code without the consent of the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, all rights to payments shall be treated as rights to receive a series of separate payments to the fullest extent allowed by Section 409A of the Code. It is also intended that the payments satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A, including those provided under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (regarding short-term deferrals), Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (regarding the severance pay exception) and Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iv) (regarding reimbursements and other separation pay).
