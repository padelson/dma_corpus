                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of August
13, 2001, is among Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Devon NewCo Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., a
Texas corporation (the "Company").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have determined that the merger of the Company with and into
Merger Sub (the "Merger"), in the manner contemplated herein, is advisable and
in the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders, and, by
resolutions duly adopted, have approved and adopted this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code"); and

         WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent to
enter into this Agreement, certain principal stockholders of the Company have
entered into a shareholders agreement with Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
which such stockholders have (i) agreed, among other things, to vote their
shares of Company common stock in favor of the Merger and (ii) granted to Parent
and Merger Sub an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of Company common stock
upon the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Principal Shareholders
Agreement").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.1  THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), the Company shall
be merged with and into Merger Sub in accordance with this Agreement, and the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and shall be a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and the Texas Business Corporation Act (the
"TBCA"). At the election of Parent, any direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
may be substituted for Merger Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger. In
such event, the parties hereto agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement in order to reflect such substitution.

Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

                          CONVERSION OF COMPANY SHARES

         Section 3.1  EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the following effects on the capital stock of the Company and Merger
Sub, without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the
Company or Merger Sub:

         (a) Conversion of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the provisions
of this Section 3.1 and Section 3.3, each share of Class A common stock, $0.10
par value per share, of the Company (each a "Company Share" and collectively the
"Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(but not including any Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and any Company
Shares that are (i) owned (A) by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent or (B) by the Company or any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) are not held on behalf of third parties (the
"Excluded Company Shares")) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into (i) the right to
receive $31.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) 0.585 of a share (the
"Exchange Ratio") of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration" and,
together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration). "Parent Common
Stock" shall mean the common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Parent.

         (b) Cancellation of Excluded Company Shares. Each Excluded Company
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
no longer be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

         (c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall thereby become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

         Section 3.2  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.

         (a) Exchange Procedures. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders
of Company Shares, an amount in cash and certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock required to effect the conversion of the Company Shares into
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a). Parent shall make
sufficient funds available to an exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), selected
by Parent with the Company's prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, from time to time as needed to pay cash in respect of dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section 3.2(b). Promptly after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than three business days following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record as of the Effective Time of a certificate representing
Company Shares (each a "Certificate") (other than holders of a Certificate in
respect of Excluded Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that
delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and


                                       3
<PAGE>   8
that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or, in lieu of such Certificates, affidavits of loss
together with either a reasonable undertaking to indemnify Parent or the
Company, if Parent believes that the person providing the indemnity is
sufficiently creditworthy, or, if Parent does not so believe, indemnity bonds)
to the Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for exchanging the Certificates and receiving the Merger
Consideration to which such holder shall be entitled therefore pursuant to
Section 3.1(a). Subject to Section 3.2(g), upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
3.1(a) and (ii) a check in the aggregate amount (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings) of (A) the cash that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) plus (B) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares determined in accordance with Section 3.2(d) plus (C) any cash dividends
and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.2. The Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon due surrender of any Certificate. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Shares that occurred prior to the Effective
Time, but is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate
formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any
certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting
such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable.

         (b) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends
or other distributions so declared in respect of such Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be issued or paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be
required thereon, to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such Certificate, without interest,
(i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date that is at or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or
prior to the date of surrender of such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in


                                       4
<PAGE>   9
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time.

         (c) Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         (d) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be received in exchange for all shares held by such holder) but for
this Section 3.2(d) shall be entitled to receive in lieu thereof an amount in
cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction (rounded to the
nearest one-hundredth of a share) by the average closing price of a share of
Parent Common Stock, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Southwestern
edition, on the five trading days immediately prior to the last business day
before the Effective Time.

         (e) Termination of Exchange Period; Unclaimed Merger Consideration. Any
shares of Parent Common Stock and any portion of the cash, dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock deposited by Parent with
the Exchange Agent (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remain unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company 180 days after the Effective
Time shall be paid to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter be entitled to look
only to Parent for payment of their Merger Consideration and any cash, dividends
and other distributions in respect thereof issuable and/or payable pursuant to
Section 3.1, Section 3.2(b) and Section 3.2(d) upon due surrender of their
Certificates (or, in lieu of such Certificates, affidavits of loss together with
either a reasonable undertaking to indemnify Parent or the Company, if Parent
believes that the Person providing the indemnity is sufficiently creditworthy,
or, if Parent does not so believe, indemnity bonds), in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

         (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and if Parent believes that the Person providing the
indemnity is sufficiently creditworthy, the making of a reasonable undertaking
to indemnify Parent or the Company, or, if Parent does not so believe, the
posting by such Person of a bond in the form customarily required by Parent to
indemnify against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Parent will issue the shares of Parent Common Stock and the
Exchange Agent will distribute such Merger Consideration, dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof issuable or payable in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 3.2(b) and
Section 3.2(d), in each case, without interest.


                                       5
<PAGE>   10
         (g) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Rule 145 Affiliate (as
determined pursuant to Section 6.10) of the Company shall not be exchanged until
Parent has received a written agreement from such Person as provided in Section
6.10.

         Section 3.3  DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. Company Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who
shall have not voted in favor of the Merger and who shall have made written
demand for payment of the fair value for such shares in accordance with Section
5.12 of the TBCA (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of the
Company Shares held by them in accordance with the TBCA, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who

in the manner provided in Section 3.1(a).

reflect such event.

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent
concurrently with the execution hereof (the "Company Disclosure Letter") or as
disclosed with reasonable specificity in the Company Reports (as defined in
Section 4.7), the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:

         Section 4.1  EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING; CORPORATE AUTHORITY. The Company
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Texas. The Company is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction
in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in
which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not have or reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 9.9). The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business
as now conducted. The copies of the Company's articles of incorporation and
bylaws previously made available to Parent are true and correct and contain all
amendments as of the date hereof.

         Section 4.2  AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENTS. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby, to
which it is a party. The consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby has been duly


                                       6
<PAGE>   11
authorized by all requisite corporate action, other than, with respect to the
Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of the Company to the extent it is a party, enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights and general
principles of equity.

         Section 4.3  CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 200,000,000 Company Shares, and 10,000,000 shares of the
Company preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share ("Company Preferred Stock").
As of August 10, 2001, there were (a) 49,911,612 Company Shares issued and
outstanding, (b) no shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding,
(c) 2,136,588 Company Shares subject to outstanding employee stock options, of
which the weighted average exercise price was approximately $27.67 per share and
(d) 1,056,257 Company bonus units outstanding, of which the weighted average
Designation Date Price (as defined in the Bonus Unit Plan) was approximately
$31.85 per unit. All issued and outstanding Company Shares (i) are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, (ii) were not issued in violation of the terms of any agreement or other
understanding binding upon the Company and (iii) were issued in compliance with
all applicable charter documents of the Company and all applicable federal and
state securities laws, rules and regulations. Except as set forth in this
Section 4.3 and except for any Company Shares issued pursuant to the plans
described in the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding shares of
capital stock and there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions,
shareholder rights plan or similar instruments, convertible securities, or other
rights, agreements or commitments which obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which
have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any
matter.

         Section 4.4  SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Significant Subsidiary" shall mean significant subsidiary as defined in Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act (the "Exchange Act"). Each
of the Company's Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability
company or partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(where applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has the corporate or partnership power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (where
applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease of
its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good
standing would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the Company's
Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and
clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims, preferential purchase
rights or other rights, interests or encumbrances ("Liens"). Schedule 4.4 to the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth for each Significant Subsidiary of the
Company, its name and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

         Section 4.5  NO VIOLATION. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has received notice that it would be with the passage of
time, in violation of any term, condition or provision of (a) its charter
documents or bylaws, (b) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license or other instrument or (c) any

of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is subject,
or is delinquent with respect to any report required to be filed with any
governmental entity, except, in the case of matters described in clause (b) or
(c), as would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except where it would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries hold all
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of
all governmental authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses (the "Company Permits") and the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits. No
investigation by any governmental authority with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
other than those that would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.6  NO CONFLICT.

         (a) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provisions of the charter documents or bylaws of the Company; (ii)
violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries under, or result
in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or
otherwise result in a detriment to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, Company Permit, lease, contract, agreement, joint
venture or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their properties is bound or affected; or (iii) contravene or conflict
with or constitute a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation,
judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of matters described in clause (ii) or
(iii), as would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof or thereof will require any consent, approval
or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or
regulatory authority, other than (i) the filings provided for in Article l and
(ii) filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or

competition or antitrust laws ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "Regulatory
Filings"), except for any consent, approval or authorization the


                                       8
<PAGE>   13
failure of which to obtain and for any filing or registration the failure of
which to make would not prevent the consummation of the Merger or otherwise
prevent the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and
would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Other than as contemplated by Section 4.6(b), no consents,
assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates are necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the
continuation in full force and effect of all of the Company's material contracts
or leases or for the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
except when the failure to receive such consents or other certificates would not
have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.6(d) to the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will: (i) result in any
payment from the Company or its Subsidiaries (including severance, unemployment
compensation, parachute payment, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Company Plan (as defined in Section 4.11) or otherwise;
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan or
otherwise; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of any such benefits.

         Section 4.7  SEC DOCUMENTS. The Company has made available to Parent
each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") since January 1, 2000, each in the form (including
exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof
(collectively, the "Company Reports"), and the Company has filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to
relevant securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since such time.
As of their respective dates, the Company Reports (i) were prepared in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
("Securities Act"), the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder
and complied with the then applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
except for such statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings
with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders' equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presents the results of operations, cash flows or changes
in stockholders' equity, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), in each case in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

         (e) Except as would not have or reasonably be expected to have,

         Section 4.14  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Company and its Subsidiaries
own or possess all necessary licenses or other valid rights to use all patents,
patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights and proprietary information used or

such licenses and other rights would not have or would not be


                                       13
<PAGE>   18
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and there are no assertions or claims challenging the
validity of any of the foregoing which would have or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except in the ordinary course of business, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has granted to any other person any license to use any of
the foregoing. The conduct of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective
businesses as currently conducted does not conflict with any patents, patent

clear of any Lien, except: (a) Liens reflected in the balance sheet of the
Company as of December 31, 2000; (b) Liens for current taxes not yet due and

obtains operating rights affecting any real or personal property are in good
standing, valid, and effective; and there is not, under any such leases, any
existing or prospective default or event of default or event which with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that would not have or be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All

condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. The Company has not received any
material advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that entitle purchasers
of production to receive deliveries of hydrocarbons without paying therefor,

         Section 4.18  OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS. The Board of Directors of
the Company has received the opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the
Company Shares (other than Parent); it being understood and acknowledged by
Parent that each such opinion has been rendered for the benefit of the Board of
Directors of the Company, and is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon by
Parent, its affiliates or their respective Subsidiaries.

         Section 4.19  CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

         (a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.19 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no contracts that are material to the business, properties,
assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole ("Material Contracts"). Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of or in default under (nor does there
exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would cause such a violation of or default under) any Material Contract to
which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound,
except for violations or defaults that have not and could not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each Material Contract is in full force and effect, and is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company or a Company Subsidiary and, to the
knowledge of the Company, each of the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors'
rights and general principles of equity. No condition exists or event has
occurred which (whether with or without notice or lapse of time or both) would
constitute a default by the Company or a Company Subsidiary or, to the knowledge
of the Company, any other party thereto under any Material Contract or result in
a right of termination of any Material Contract.

         (b) Set forth in Schedule 4.19(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter is
(i) a list of all loan or credit agreements, notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures
and other agreements and instruments pursuant to which any indebtedness of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$5,000,000 is outstanding or may be incurred, and (ii) the respective principal
amounts currently outstanding thereunder.

         (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any contract and there is no commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or subject to that
has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or
impairing the conduct of business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any contract that may be terminable as a result of Parent's status as a
competitor of any party to such contract or arrangement.

         Section 4.20  VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of holders of
two-thirds of the outstanding Company Shares is the only vote necessary to
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company
Requisite Vote").

         Section 4.21  CERTAIN APPROVALS. The Company's Board of Directors has
taken any and all necessary and appropriate action to render inapplicable to the
Merger and the


                                       15
<PAGE>   20
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Principal Shareholders
Agreement the provisions of Section 13.03 of the TBCA and any other "fair
price," "moratorium," control share acquisition, interested shareholder or other
similar antitakeover provision or regulation and any restrictive provision of
any antitakeover provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company.

         Section 4.22  CERTAIN CONTRACTS. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any non-competition agreement or any
other agreement or obligation which purports to limit the manner in which, or
the localities in which, the current business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, is conducted or (ii) any executory agreement or obligation which pertains
to the acquisition or disposition of any asset, or which provides any third
party any lien, claim or preferential right with regard thereto, except, in the
case of this clause (ii), for such agreements or obligations that would not have
or be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                                   ARTICLE 5
                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
                              PARENT AND MERGER SUB

         Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to the Company
concurrently with the execution hereof (the "Parent Disclosure Letter") or as
disclosed with reasonable specificity in the Parent Reports (as defined in
Section 5.7), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Company that:

         Section 5.1  EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING; CORPORATE AUTHORITY. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.9).
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. As of the date hereof, the copies of each of Parent's and Merger
Sub's certificate of incorporation and bylaws previously made available to the
Company are true and correct and contain all amendments.

         Section 5.2  AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENTS. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby, to which it is a party. The consummation by each of Parent and Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance and delivery
by Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, has been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action, other than, with respect to the
Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by Parent's stockholders.
This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub to the extent it is a party, enforceable in accordance
with their respective


                                       16
<PAGE>   21
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

Special Voting Stock, par value $0.10 per share, and 4,500,000 shares of
Parent's preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share "Parent Preferred Stock").
As of August 10, 2001, there were (a) 125,983,553 shares of Parent Common Stock

the Parent Restricted Stock Award Plan, (e) 40,646 shares of Parent Common Stock
reserved for issuance under certain conditional stock awards granted to former

6.49% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, issued and outstanding and (h)

Parent Common Stock (i) are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,

preemptive rights, (ii) were not issued in violation of the terms of any
agreement or other understanding binding upon Parent and (iii) were issued in
compliance with all applicable charter documents of Parent and all applicable
federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations. One right to purchase
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of Parent (each, a "Parent Right")
issued pursuant to a Rights Agreement, dated as of August 17, 1999 (the "Parent
Rights Agreement"), between Parent and BankBoston, N.A., is associated with and
attached to each outstanding share of Parent Common Stock. The shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, when issued in
accordance with this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in this
Section 5.3 and except for any shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to
the plans described in the Parent Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding
shares of capital stock and there are no options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions, convertible securities, or other rights, agreements or
commitments which obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer
or sell any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no outstanding
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on any matter.

         Section 5.4  SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES.

         (a) Each of Parent's Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited
liability company or partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (where applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization, has the corporate, limited liability company or partnership

business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except for


                                       17
<PAGE>   22
jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing
would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of Parent's Significant
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
and is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent free and clear of all Liens.
Schedule 5.4 to the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth for each Significant
Subsidiary of Parent its name and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

         (b) Devon Energy Production Company, L.P. ("Devon Production"), a
Significant Subsidiary, is a limited partnership (except for tax purposes) duly
organized and validly existing under Oklahoma law, the general partner of which
is Devon Energy Management Company, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability
company which is wholly owned by Devon Energy Corporation (Oklahoma), an
Oklahoma corporation, and has elected to be treated as a sole proprietorship for
federal income tax purposes. Devon Production has one limited partner. All of
the outstanding partnership interests of Devon Production are owned directly or
indirectly by Parent.

         (c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub are

engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and has not engaged in any
activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         Section 5.5  NO VIOLATION. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
is, or has received notice that it would be with the passage of time, in
violation of any term, condition or provision of (a) its charter documents or
bylaws, (b) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license or other instrument or (c) any order of any
court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or any law,
ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is subject, or is
delinquent with respect to any report required to be filed with any governmental
entity, except, in the case of matters described in clause (b) or (c), as would
not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all governmental
authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the
"Parent Permits") and Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Parent Permits. No investigation by any governmental authority with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened, other than those that would not have or reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 5.6  NO CONFLICT.

         (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement nor the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will: (i) conflict with
or result in a breach of any provisions of the charter documents or bylaws of
Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of
any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of


                                       18
<PAGE>   23
time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or
in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of
purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of Parent or its Subsidiaries
under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding
effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, lease, contract,
agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected; or (iii)
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of matters described in
clause (ii) or (iii), as would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this
Agreement nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will require any
consent, approval or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any
governmental or regulatory authority, other than Regulatory Filings, and listing
of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger on the AMEX, except for
any consent, approval or authorization the failure of which to obtain and for
any filing or registration the failure of which to make would not prevent the
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not have or reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Other than as contemplated by Section 5.6(b), no consents,
assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates are necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the
continuation in full force and effect of all of Parent's material contracts or
leases or for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except
when the failure to receive such consents or other certificates would not have
or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.7  SEC DOCUMENTS. Parent has made available to the Company
each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) filed by Parent with the SEC since January 1,
2000, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed
with the SEC prior to the date hereof (collectively, the "Parent Reports"), and
Parent has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it
with the SEC pursuant to relevant securities statutes, regulations, policies and
rules since such time. As of their respective dates, the Parent Reports (i) were
prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder and complied with the
then applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except for such
statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC
prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports


                                       19
<PAGE>   24

operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders' equity, as the case may be,
of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to such exceptions as may be permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC), in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein.

         Section 5.8  ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Since December 31, 2000,
Parent has conducted its business only in the ordinary and usual course of
business, and during such period there have not been (i) events, conditions,
actions, occurrences or omissions that would have or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; (ii) any change by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in any of its
accounting methods, principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices
or elections, except for changes required by generally accepted accounting
principles; or (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend
or other distribution in respect of the capital stock of Parent (except for, and
provided that, Parent may continue to pay or cause to be paid, dividends upon
the shares of Parent Common Stock and the Northstar Exchangeable Shares at a
rate not greater than $.05 per share in any quarter and dividends upon its 6.49%
cumulative preferred stock).

         Section 5.9  NO BROKERS. Other than UBS Warburg LLC, Parent has not
entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or firm
which may result in the obligation of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to pay
any finder's fees, brokerage or agent's commissions or other like payments in
connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 5.10  OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Board of Directors of
Parent has received the opinion of UBS Warburg LLC to the effect that, as of the
date of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point
of view, to Parent; it being understood and acknowledged by Parent that such
opinion has been rendered for the benefit of the Board of Directors of Parent,
and is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon by the Company, its
affiliates or their respective Subsidiaries.

         Section 5.11  VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy by holders of Parent Common
Stock and the outstanding Northstar Exchangeable Shares, voting as a single
class with the Parent Special Voting Share voting for the Northstar Exchangeable
Shares as provided in Parent's charter, represented in person or by proxy at a
meeting at which a quorum is present, approving the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to Article 3, is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of Parent capital stock necessary to approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Parent Requisite
Vote"); provided, however, if a proposal to amend Parent's certificate of
incorporation is presented at the meeting for approval pursuant to Section 2.1
hereof, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock and the outstanding Northstar Exchangeable Shares,
voting as a single


                                       20
<PAGE>   25
class with the Parent Special Voting Share voting for the Northstar Exchangeable
Shares as provided in Parent's charter, will be required for approval.

         Section 5.12  FINANCING. Parent has available to it sources of
financing sufficient to satisfy its obligation to make the payment of the
aggregate cash consideration when such payment is required pursuant to this
Agreement.

         Section 5.13  LITIGATION AND LIABILITIES. There are no actions, suits
or proceedings pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Parent's
knowledge, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in
equity, or before or by any federal, state or foreign commission, board, bureau,
agency or instrumentality, other than those that would not have or be reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. There are no outstanding judgments, decrees, injunctions, awards or
orders against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than those that would
not have or be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.14  TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Except for goods and other property
sold, used or otherwise disposed of since December 31, 2000 in the ordinary
course of business for fair value, Parent has defensible title for oil and gas
purposes to all its properties, interests in properties and assets, real and
personal, reflected in its December 31, 2000 financial statements, free and
clear of any Lien, except: (a) Liens reflected in the balance sheet of Parent as
of December 31, 2000; (b) Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable and
(c) such imperfections of title, easements and Liens that would not have or be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the
United States of America or any state having jurisdiction;

         (p) shall not enter into or amend any agreement with any holder of
Company Shares with respect to holding, voting or disposing of shares;

         (q) shall not by resolution of its Board of Directors cause the
acceleration of rights, benefits or payments under any Company Plans;

         (r) shall not enter into any additional forward sales contracts, fixed

respect to its oil production and more than 10% of its budgeted gas production
for the year 2001, and, in any event, for a term longer than 12 months; or

         (s) shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree in
writing or otherwise to take any of the foregoing actions.

         Section 6.2  NO SOLICITATION BY THE COMPANY.

         (a) The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries (i) will not (and
it will not permit their officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing material non-public information) any inquiry,
proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with
respect to a third party tender offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving any assets or class of capital
stock of the Company, or any acquisition of 10% or more of the capital stock
(other than upon exercise of the Company Options that are outstanding as of the
date hereof) or 10% or more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions,
or any combination of the foregoing (any such proposal, offer or transaction
being hereinafter referred to as a "Company Acquisition Proposal") or
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning a Company
Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing; provided that, subject to Section 6.3(b),
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of
Directors from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) prior to the Cutoff Date
(as defined below), providing information (pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement containing terms identical in all material respects to the terms of
the confidentiality agreement, dated June 21, 2001, entered into between the
Company and Parent (the "Company/Parent Confidentiality Agreement")) to or
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person or entity who has
made an unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal if (x) in the good
faith judgment of the Company's Board of Directors, taking into account the
likelihood of consummation and after consultation with its financial advisors,
such Company Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
transaction more favorable to the holders of the Company Shares from a financial
point of view than the Merger and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable law.

         (b) The Company will promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent of any requests referred to in Section 6.2(a) for information or the
receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the
person or group engaging in such discussions or negotiations, requesting such
information or making such Company Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms
and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep Parent
informed on a timely basis (but in any event within 24 hours) of any material
changes with respect thereto. Prior to taking any action referred to in the
proviso of Section 6.2(a), if the Company intends to participate in any such
discussions or negotiations or provide any such information to any such third
party, the Company shall give prompt prior notice to Parent of each such action.


                                       24
<PAGE>   29

         (c) Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall permit the Company to enter into
any agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal during the term of
this Agreement, it being agreed that, during the term of this Agreement, the
Company shall not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for, or
in any way facilitates, a Company Acquisition Proposal, other than a
confidentiality agreement containing terms identical in all material respects to
the terms of the Company/Parent Confidentiality Agreement.

         (d) For purposes hereof, the "Cutoff Date" means the date the Company
Requisite Vote has been obtained.

         Section 6.3  MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS.

         (a) The Company will take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws to convene as
promptly as practicable a meeting of its stockholders for purposes of obtaining
the Company Requisite Vote. Parent will take all action necessary in accordance
with applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to convene
as promptly as practicable a meeting of its stockholders for purposes of
obtaining the Parent Requisite Vote.

         (b) The Company and Parent, through their respective Boards of
Directors, shall recommend approval of such matters; provided that the Board of
Directors of the Company or Parent may at any time prior to the Effective Time
withdraw, modify, or change any recommendation regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or recommend and declare advisable any other
offer or proposal, if its Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside counsel that the failure to so withdraw, modify,
or change its recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law. Each of the Company and Parent shall be
required to comply with its obligations under Section 6.3(a) whether or not its
Board of Directors withdraws, modifies, or changes its recommendation regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or recommends any other
offer or proposal.

         (c) In the event that stockholders of the Company or Parent fail to
approve this Agreement at a meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof)
at which such stockholders considered and voted on this Agreement, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith for at least 20 days to attempt to revise the
structure and terms of the Merger to allow the combination of the respective
businesses of Parent and the Company on terms they regard as likely to be
approved by such stockholders.

         Section 6.4  FILINGS; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company
and Parent shall:

                 (i) promptly (but in not more than 20 business days from the
         date hereof) make their respective filings under the HSR Act with
         respect to the Merger and thereafter shall promptly make any other
         required submissions under the HSR Act;


                                       25
<PAGE>   30
                 (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to satisfy the
         conditions to closing in Article VII (including, in the case of the
         Company, obtaining the opinion described in Section 7.2(b) and, in the
         case of Parent, obtaining the opinion described in Section 7.3(b)) and
         to cooperate with one another in (a) determining which filings are
         required to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which
         consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be
         obtained prior to the Effective Time from governmental or regulatory
         authorities of the United States, the several states, and foreign
         jurisdictions in connection with the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
         contemplated hereby; and (b) timely making all such filings and timely
         seeking all such consents, approvals, permits or authorizations;

                 (iii) promptly notify each other of any communication
         concerning this Agreement or the Merger to that party from any
         governmental authority and permit the other party to review in advance
         any proposed communication concerning this Agreement or the Merger to
         any governmental entity;

                 (iv) not agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with
         any governmental authority in respect of any filings, investigation or
         other inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it
         consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted
         by such governmental authority, gives the other party the opportunity
         to attend and participate thereat;

                 (v) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
         filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
         thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective
         representatives on the one hand, and any government or regulatory
         authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with
         respect to this Agreement and the Merger; and

                 (vi) furnish the other party with such necessary information
         and reasonable assistance as such other parties and their respective
         affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation
         of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to
         any governmental or regulatory authorities, including without
         limitation, any filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions
         of the HSR Act.

         (b) Without limiting Section 6.4(a), Parent and the Company shall:

                 (i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of,
         or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that
         would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including without
         limitation defending through litigation on the merits any claim
         asserted in any court by any party; and

                 (ii)     each use reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate
         each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
         regulation law that may be asserted by any governmental entity with
         respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
         reasonably possible (and in any event no later than 60 days following
         the termination of all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act,
         unless the parties are in litigation with the government, in which case
         at the conclusion of such litigation).


                                       26
<PAGE>   31
         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
Company shall not, without Parent's prior written consent, commit to any
divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters, including
covenants affecting business operating practices (or allow its Subsidiaries to
commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar
matters), and the Company shall commit to, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to effect (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to commit to and use reasonable best
efforts to effect), any such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements
or similar matters as Parent shall request, but solely if such divestitures,
licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters are contingent on
consummation of the Merger and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required (pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(ii) or otherwise) to agree (with
respect to (x) Parent or its Subsidiaries or (y) the Company or its
Subsidiaries) to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or
similar matters, including covenants affecting business operating practices, if
such divestitures, licenses, arrangements or similar matters, individually or in
the aggregate, would have or reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) Except as provided below, nothing in this Section 6.4 or any other
part of this Agreement shall require Parent to refrain from entering into any
agreement with respect to, or issuing Parent Common Stock or other consideration
in connection with, a business combination with, or an acquisition of, a third
party after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (a
"Subsequent Transaction"); provided, however, that Parent has a good faith
belief at the time it enters into the definitive agreement calling for any such
Subsequent Transaction that such Subsequent Transaction is not reasonably likely
to prevent or delay satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article
7. In the event of a Subsequent Transaction which would be permissible under the
preceding sentence, Parent shall agree to any divestitures, licenses, hold
separate arrangements or similar matters (including covenants affecting business
operating practices) necessary in order to obtain prompt approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under applicable competition laws
that would not otherwise have been required in order to obtain such approval but
for the Subsequent Transaction.

         Section 6.5  INSPECTION. From the date hereof to the Effective Time,
the Company and Parent shall allow all designated officers, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives of the other party access at all
reasonable times upon reasonable notice to the records and files,
correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information relating to
commitments, contracts, titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining
to the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and
its Subsidiaries, including inspection of such properties; provided that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall affect any representation or
warranty given by any party hereunder, and provided further that notwithstanding
the provision of information or investigation by any party, no party shall be
deemed to make any representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be required
to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to
the other party by reason of applicable law, rules or regulations, which that
party reasonably believes constitutes information protected by attorney/client
privilege, or which it is required to keep confidential by reason of contract or
agreement with third parties. The parties hereto will make reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. The Company and Parent agree that
they will not, and will cause their representatives not


                                       27
<PAGE>   32
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.5 for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         Section 6.6  PUBLICITY. The parties will consult with each other and
will mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such press releases or make any such public announcements prior to such
consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make
such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before issuing any such press releases or making
any such public announcements.

         Section 6.7  REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

         (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare
and Parent shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"),
with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger. A portion of the
Registration Statement shall also serve as the joint proxy statement with
respect to the meetings of the stockholders of Parent and of the Company in
connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). The respective
parties will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and the Company will cooperate
with Parent, to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as
promptly as practicable. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement, all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will pay all expenses incident
thereto. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by
the SEC for additional information.

         (b) Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

         (c) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that the information provided
by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the
respective meetings of stockholders of Parent and of the Company, or, in the
case of information provided by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement
or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it is filed or becomes
effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

         Section 6.8  LISTING APPLICATION. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the AMEX prior to the Effective Time, subject to
official notice of issuance. Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the
AMEX a supplemental listing application covering the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in the Merger and shares issuable pursuant to Assumed Options (as
defined below).

         Section 6.9  LETTERS OF ACCOUNTANTS.

         (a) If requested to do so by Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent "comfort" letters of
Arthur Andersen LLP, the Company's independent public accountants, dated the
effective date of the Registration Statement and the Closing Date, respectively,
and addressed to Parent with regard to certain financial information regarding
the Company included in the Registration Statement, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for "comfort"
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

         (b) If requested to do so by the Company, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company "comfort"
letters of KPMG LLP, Parent's independent public accountants, dated the
effective date of the Registration Statement and the Closing Date, respectively,
and addressed to the Company, with regard to certain financial information
regarding Parent included in the Registration Statement, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance for "comfort"
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

         Section 6.10  AGREEMENTS OF AFFILIATES.

         (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to Parent a list identifying all persons who, at the time of the
meeting or the meeting of the Company's stockholders pursuant to Section 6.3,
the Company believes may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company, as that
term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the
"Rule 145 Affiliates"). Parent shall be entitled to place restrictive legends on
any shares of Parent Common Stock received by such Rule 145 Affiliates. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is
identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to Parent, at or
prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A.

         Section 6.11  EXPENSES. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, except as expressly provided in Section 8.5.

         Section 6.12  INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law each person who is, or has been at any time prior
to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the


                                       29
<PAGE>   34
Company (or any Subsidiary or division thereof) and each person who served at
the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and,
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such,
whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an
"Action"), (i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, as incurred,
the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable
law, and (ii) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and provided further that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.12(a) to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single
Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties,
there is or may be a conflict of interests between two or more of such
Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each
similarly situated group.

         (b) The parties agree that the rights to indemnification, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action or
suit, in the articles of incorporation, bylaws and any indemnification agreement
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters occurring through
the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted
or claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such
Action or resolution of such claim.

         (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance covering
the Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were
covered by the Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance
("D&O Insurance") policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance with respect to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether
claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the Effective Time); provided, that after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof (the amount of which premiums are set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter) (the "Maximum Premium"), but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. Parent shall have the right
to cause coverage to be extended under the Company's D&O Insurance by obtaining
a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the
Company's existing D&O Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the
provisions of this Section 6.12(c).



                                       30
<PAGE>   35
         (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
TBCA, or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.12 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Parties.

         (e) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.

         Section 6.13  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         (a) Parent hereby agrees to honor, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries
to honor, all employee benefit plans, contracts, agreements and commitments of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries maintained or entered into by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof that apply to any current or
former employee or current or former director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the executive change-in-control
severance agreements between the Company and certain of its key employees
(copies of which executive change-in-control severance agreements have been
furnished to Parent); provided, however, that except as provided in Section
6.13(c), Parent reserves the right to modify any such contract, agreement or
commitment in accordance with its terms.

         (b) If, within two years after the Effective Time, the benefits
applicable to Continuing Employees are materially modified then, for the
remainder of the two-year period after the Effective Time, Parent hereby agrees
to, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to officers and employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who become or remain regular (full-time)
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries ("Continuing Employees") employee
benefits, other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, no less
favorable than those provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to their similarly
situated officers and employees. Any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who becomes a participant in any employee benefit plan, program,
policy, or arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective
Time shall be given credit under such plan, program, policy, or arrangement for
all service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, if applicable,
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to becoming such a participant for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit determination (other than for
determining accrual services under any defined benefit pension plan as defined
in Section 3(35) of ERISA).

         (c) Parent hereby agrees to, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide the following benefits to Continuing Employees or to former employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as described below:

                 (i) Parent shall continue retiree medical benefits for each
         former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who was receiving
         retiree medical benefits at the


                                       31
<PAGE>   36

         Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the retiree medical
         benefit arrangements applicable to that employee.

                 (ii) Parent shall provide retiree medical benefits for
         Continuing Employees who have attained age 55 and have 10 years of
         service with the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time,
         with such retiree medical benefits to be provided when such Continuing
         Employee terminates employment with Parent or its Subsidiaries and with
         benefits substantially equivalent to the retiree medical benefits being
         provided to former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
         Effective Time and at the same percentage of contribution rate as in
         effect at the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
         retiree medical benefit arrangements in effect on the date hereof.

                 (iii) Parent shall provide coverage for severance benefits for
         Continuing Employees for a period of at least one year after the
         Effective Time, and the eligibility and coverage for, and the amount
         of, such severance benefits shall be at least as favorable as is
         provided by the Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. Severance Benefit
         Plan.

                 (iv) For a period of at least one year after the Effective
         Time, Parent shall continue defined benefit pension benefits for
         Continuing Employees by continuing the Mitchell Energy & Development
         Corp. Retirement Plan (the "Company Retirement Plan") and each of the
         Company's supplemental retirement plans (the "Company's Supplemental
         Retirement Plans") for such Continuing Employees or by providing
         benefits under another defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Parent
         or its Subsidiaries, and for a period of at least 13 months after the
         Effective Time, Parent shall not permit the form of payment provisions
         in the Company's Supplemental Retirement Plans to be amended.

                 (v) At such time as Parent causes a Continuing Employee to be
         covered under a group health plan maintained by Parent or one of its
         Subsidiaries (other than the group health plan maintained by the
         Company at the Effective Time), Parent shall cause (1) such Continuing
         Employee and his or her eligible dependents (including, without
         limitation, all such Continuing Employee's dependents covered
         immediately prior to such time under the Company's group health plan)
         to be credited under such Parent group health plan, for the year during
         which such coverage under such group health plan begins, with any
         deductibles and copayments already incurred during such year under the
         Company's group health plan, and (ii) such Parent group health plan to
         waive any preexisting condition restrictions to the extent necessary to
         provide immediate coverage. Parent shall cause each other employee
         welfare benefit plan or program sponsored by Parent or one of its
         Subsidiaries that is of a similar type to a plan or program Continuing
         Employees participated in prior to the Effective Time to waive any
         preexisting condition exclusion with respect to Continuing Employees.

         (d) Parent and the Company shall take such actions, including (with
respect to the Company) the amendment of the options ("Stock Options") to
purchase Company Shares, and the plans pursuant to which such options have been
issued, to permit Parent to assume, and Parent shall assume, effective at the
Effective Time, each Option Plan and each Stock Option that remains unexercised
in whole or in part as of the Effective Time and substitute shares of


                                       32
<PAGE>   37
Parent Common Stock for the Company Shares purchasable under each such assumed
option ("Assumed Option"), which assumption and substitution shall be effected
as follows:

                 (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
         under the Assumed Option shall be equal to 1.20 times the number of
         shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Assumed Option (without
         regard to any vesting schedule and with any fractional amount rounded
         to the next lowest share);

                 (ii) the per share exercise price of such Assumed Option shall
         be an amount (with fractional amounts rounded to the next highest cent)
         equal to the per share exercise price of the Stock Option being assumed
         divided by 1.20;

                 (iii) Parent will provide each holder of each Stock Option
         being assumed with a statement showing the converted number of shares,
         the exercise price, and the expiration date for each Assumed Option;
         and

                 (iv) any other provisions of each Assumed Option shall remain
         in effect, and Parent shall not permit the acceleration of the
         exercisability or require the mandatory surrender of the Assumed
         Options in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable provisions
         of the Option Plans.

         (e) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Assumed Options, and, as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
the Assumed Options, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any of the Assumed
Options remain outstanding.

         (f) Parent and the Company shall take such actions to permit Parent to
assume, and Parent shall assume, effective at the Effective Time, each bonus
unit ("Bonus Unit") issued under the Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. 1997
Bonus Unit Plan ("Bonus Unit Plan") that remains unredeemed in whole or in part
as of the Effective Time and substitute the value of shares of Parent Common
Stock for the value of the shares of Company Common Stock that is used to
determine the amount payable to an employee upon redemption of the Bonus Unit
("Assumed Bonus Unit"), which assumption and substitution shall be effected as
follows:

                 (i) the number of Bonus Units redeemable under the Assumed
         Bonus Unit shall be equal to 1.20 times the number of Bonus Units being
         assumed (without regard to any vesting schedule and with any fractional
         amount rounded to the next lowest share);

                 (ii) the value of each Assumed Bonus Unit as of the Redemption
         Date (as defined in the Bonus Unit Plan) shall be equal to the amount,
         if any, by which (A) the closing price of a share of Parent Common
         Stock on such date exceeds (B) the "exercise price" of the Assumed
         Bonus Unit, which shall be the closing price of Company Common Stock on
         the Designation Date (as defined in the Bonus Unit Plan) divided by
         1.20 (with fractional amounts rounded to the next highest cent);


                                       33
<PAGE>   38
                 (iii) Parent will provide each holder of Bonus Units being
         assumed with a statement showing the converted number of units, the
         exercise price of the Assumed Bonus Units, and the expiration date for
         each Assumed Bonus Unit; and

                 (iv) any other provisions of each Assumed Bonus Unit shall
         remain in effect, and Parent shall not permit the acceleration of the
         exercisability of the Assumed Bonus Units in connection with the Merger
         pursuant to Section VII of the Bonus Unit Plan.

         (g) Parent agrees that its Board of Directors (or the Compensation
Committee thereof) shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, adopt resolutions
specifically approving, for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the receipt, pursuant to this Section 6.13, of Assumed Options and
Assumed Bonus Units.

         Section 6.14  REORGANIZATION. From and after the date hereof and until
the Effective Time, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall knowingly (i) take any action, or fail to take any reasonable
action, as a result of which the Merger would fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) enter
into any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to take or fail to take
any such action. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall not knowingly take
any action or knowingly cause any action to be taken which would cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local
law).

         Section 6.15 DIVIDENDS.  The Company shall coordinate with Parent the
declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of dividends on Company
Shares so that holders of Company Shares do not receive dividends on both
Company Shares and Parent Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of any
calendar quarter or fail to receive a dividend on Company Shares or Parent
Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of any calendar quarter.

<PAGE>   42

in Section 7.1(a)(i) was not satisfied at the time of such termination and (z)
the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a)(ii) was satisfied at the time of such

million. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.5(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.5(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set forth
in this Section 8.5(a), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses

at the time of the meeting for the purpose of obtaining the approval required by
Section 7.1(a)(ii), (including adjournments or postponements), any person shall
have made a Parent Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) that has become
public or shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (y) the condition set forth

the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a)(i) was satisfied at the time of such
termination) to make a Parent Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) by the Company

Termination Amount and, in addition, reimburse the Company for all expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement up to the
Reimbursement Maximum Amount upon termination of this Agreement. All payments
shall be made in cash by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company.
The term "Parent Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer
(including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to a third
party tender offer, merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving any assets or class of capital stock of Parent, or any
acquisition of 10% or more of the capital stock (other than upon exercise of
Parent employee stock options that are outstanding as of the date hereof) or 10%
or more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in
a single transaction or a series of related transactions, or any combination of
the foregoing. Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant
to this Section 8.5(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent for the payment set
forth in this Section 8.5(b), Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such


                                       38
<PAGE>   43
amount from the date payment was required to be made until the date such payment
is actually made at the Adjusted Prime Rate.

         (c) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment
of the Merger pursuant to this Article 8, all obligations of the parties hereto
shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section
8.5 and Section 6.11 and except for the provisions of Sections 9.3, 9.4, 9.6,
9.8, 9.9, 9.12, 9.13 and 9.14, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any
party from any liability for any breach by such party of any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies of such
nonbreaching party under this Agreement in the case of such a breach, at law or
in equity, shall be preserved.

         Section 8.6  EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each party may by action taken by its Board of Directors, to the extent

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
