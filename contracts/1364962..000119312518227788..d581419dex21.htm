Shares and shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock) shall be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to
and in accordance with Section 1.4, an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the Per Share Cash Consideration. The amount of cash each Company
Stockholder holding shares of Company Capital Stock is entitled to receive for
such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be rounded to the nearest cent and
computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company Capital
Stock held by such Company Stockholder.

 

(ii) _Unvested Company Shares_. The payment of cash pursuant to this Section
1.3(a) in exchange for Unvested Company Shares held by Continuing Employees
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
subject to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable
to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time
after giving effect to any applicable Equity Agreement (and no vesting
acceleration shall occur by reason of the Merger or any subsequent event, such
as termination of employment, except as may be specifically disclosed
in Section 2.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter after giving effect to any
Equity Agreement, and as set forth in any Equity Agreement). Therefore, cash
otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(ii) in exchange for the
Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Unvested Cash_ ") shall not automatically be payable by
Acquirer at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Acquirer
on the date that such Unvested Company Shares would have become vested under
the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the
Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting
schedule and after giving effect to any applicable Equity Agreement), less
the amount of such newly vested cash that vests while in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund in accordance with Section 1.4(c). Acquirer may in its discretion make
all such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash no later than the 15th
day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which
such Unvested Cash would have become vested under the original vesting
schedule, or pursuant to any applicable Equity Agreement, and in its
discretion may make such payments

 



7  through a paying agent authorized by Acquirer to administer such payments on
Acquirers behalf or through Acquirers (or the Surviving Corporations)
payroll system and in accordance with standard payroll practices (including
withholding for applicable Taxes). All amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 1.3(a)(ii) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and
shall be paid without interest. If a valid and timely 83(b) election was
filed with respect to a Continuing Employees Unvested Company Shares, and
evidence of such valid and timely filing is provided to Acquirer, the parties
intend that the Unvested Cash received by such Continuing Employee will be
treated in its entirety as consideration for the Continuing Employees
Unvested Company Shares and not as compensation for services and will file all
tax returns and reports consistent with such treatment except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. A portion of such newly vested cash so distributed
will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder. All outstanding rights to
repurchase Unvested Company Shares that the Company may hold or similar
restrictions in the Companys favor immediately prior to the Effective Time
(all such rights, " _Repurchase Rights_ ") shall be assigned to Acquirer in
the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Acquirer upon the same
terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time (as such may be amended pursuant the terms of an Equity
Agreement, if applicable), except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by
Acquirer retaining the Unvested Cash into which such Unvested Company Shares
have been converted and paying to the former holder thereof the repurchase
price in effect for each such share subject to that Repurchase Right
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No Unvested Cash, or right thereto,
may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any
transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Acquirer, or
be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any
Liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such
Unvested Cash in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(iii) _Company Options_.

 

(A) _Vested Options_. Each Company Option that is outstanding and vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the Equity
Agreements and any benefits waivers in favor of the Company and Acquirer in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (a " _Benefits Waiver_ "
__ )) (each such Company Option, a " _Cash-Out Option_") shall not be assumed
by Acquirer and shall instead be cancelled in exchange for a payment by
Acquirer of an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Cash-Out
Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash
Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such Cash-Out
Option (collectively, the " _Option Payments_ "). The amount of cash each
Company Optionholder holding a Cash-Out Option is entitled to receive for
such Cash-Out Option shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating cash amounts for all Cash-Out Options held by such Company
Optionholder and will be reduced by any applicable payroll, income tax or
other withholding Taxes. The Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or
cause to be taken all actions, and shall obtain all consents, as may be
required to effect the

 



8  treatment of Company Options pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii)(A).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Option Payments made pursuant to this
Section 1.3(a)(iii)(A) shall only be made to holders of Cash-Out Options who
have delivered a duly executed Option Consent pursuant to the terms of Section
1.4(b) below.

 

(B) _Unvested In-the-Money Options Held by Continuing Employees_. Each
Company Option that (i) is not a Cash-Out Option, (ii) has an exercise price
less than Per Share Cash Consideration, (iii) is held by a Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) is unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time after giving to the
Equity Agreements shall be assumed by Acquirer and shall become an option to
acquire Acquirer Common Stock as follows: (1) the number of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock subject to each Company Option assumed by Acquirer shall
be determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock; and (2) the per share
exercise price for the Acquirer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Company Option assumed by Acquirer shall be determined by dividing (A) the
applicable per share exercise price of such Company Option, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent. Each such
assumed Company Option shall be subject to the same vesting schedule, terms
and conditions that were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior
to or at the Effective Time (after giving effect to any Benefits Waiver), and
no vesting acceleration of these assumed Company Options shall occur by reason
of the Merger or any subsequent event, such as termination of employment. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Cancelled Company Options (as defined in the
Equity Agreements) will be cancelled prior to the Effective Time and will
therefore not be assumed pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii)(B). No assumed
option may be "early exercised" (i.e., an assumed option may be exercised for
shares of Acquirer Common Stock only to the extent the assumed option is
vested at the time of exercise pursuant to the applicable vesting schedule).
It is the intent of the parties hereto that to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, all assumed options in respect of Company Options that prior
to the Effective Time were treated as incentive or non-qualified stock options
under the Code shall from and after the Effective Time continue to be treated
as incentive or non-qualified stock options, respectively, under the Code. The
Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken all actions,
and shall obtain all consents, as may be required to effect the treatment of
Company Options pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii)(B). A Company Option that
has an exercise price equal to or more than the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time, not be assumed and
shall receive no consideration.

(C) _Unvested Designated Options Held by Continuing Employees_. Each Company
Option that (i) was granted on May 16, 2018, (ii) is held by a Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) is unexpired,
unexercised, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, for the
avoidance of doubt, has not been repriced and cancelled pursuant to the
Repricing (after giving effect to any Benefits Waiver) (each such Company
Option, a " _Designated Option_ ") shall not be assumed by Acquirer and shall
instead be cancelled in exchange for a payment by Acquirer of an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock that 

 



9  were subject to such Designated Option, whether vested or unvested,
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration
over the applicable per share exercise price of such Designated Option (the "
_Designated Option Payment_ " __ ). The payment of cash pursuant to this
Section 1.3(a)(iii)(C) in exchange for Designated Options shall be subject to
the same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such
Designated Options immediately prior to or at the Effective Time and no
vesting acceleration shall occur by reason of the Merger or any subsequent
event, such as termination of employment. Therefore, the Designated Option
Payment in exchange for the Designated Options shall not automatically be
payable by Acquirer at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by
Acquirer on the date that such Designated Options would have become
vested under the vesting schedule in place for such Designated Options at the
Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting
schedule (after giving effect to any Benefits Waiver)) and no vesting
acceleration of Designated Option Payments shall occur by reason of the
Merger or any subsequent event, such as termination of employment; _provided_
that if such vesting conditions and terms are not satisfied and vesting ceases
at any point after the Effective Time, Acquirer shall make no further
Designated Option Payments and such remaining unvested Designated Option
Payments will be forfeited. Acquirer shall make, or in its discretion shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to make, all such required Designated Option
Payments no later than the earlier of (1) fifteen Business Days following the
date on which the corresponding Designated Option would have become vested
under the service-based vesting schedule in place for such Designated Option
at the Effective Time, and (2) the end of the calendar year in which the
portion of the Designated Option vests; _provided_ that Acquirer and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such
Designated Option Payment the required amount of withholding for Taxes
pursuant to Section 1.9. The amount of cash each Company Optionholder holding
a Designated Option is entitled to receive for such Designated Option shall be
rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for
all Designated Options held by such Company Optionholder and will be reduced
by any applicable payroll, income tax or other withholding Taxes. All amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii)(C) shall be paid without
interest. The Company shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken
all actions, and shall obtain all consents, as may be required to effect the
treatment of Company Options pursuant to this Section
1.3(a)(iii)(C). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Designated Option Payments
made pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii)(C) shall only be made to holders of
Designated Options who have delivered a duly executed Designated Option
Consent pursuant to the terms of Section 1.4(b) below.

(D) _Unvested Company Options Held by Persons Other than Continuing
Employees_. Each Company Option that is (i) not a Cash-Out Option, (ii) held
by a Person other than a Continuing Employee and (iii) unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without
any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and
extinguished and shall not be assumed by Acquirer in the Merger. The Company
shall, prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken all actions, and shall
obtain all consents, as may be required to effect the treatment of Company
Options pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)(iii)(C).

(iv) _Company Warrants_. Each Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested,
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be
cancelled and extinguished and shall not be assumed by Acquirer in the Merger.

 



10 (b) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company_. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any
cash or other property or consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquirer, Merger Sub or
any other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporations capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after
the Effective Time). From and after the Effective Time, each certificate
evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub capital stock will
evidence ownership of such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock or Acquirer Common Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior
to the Effective Time, all references herein to specified numbers of shares of
any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that
are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading
prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent
necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like
change.

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Dissenting Shares (if any) shall not be converted into the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, but shall instead
be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to the DGCL or the CCC. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the
DGCL or the CCC, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall
receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL or the CCC (but only
after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting
Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares
shall immediately be deemed to have converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect
of such shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and
Acquirer shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as
reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in
Section 1.4(a), following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 1.4(a), the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as
if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. The Company shall provide to
Acquirer (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal or purchase
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments related to such demands served pursuant to the DGCL or the CCC and
received by the Company and (ii) the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such 

 



11  demands under the DGCL or the CCC. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Acquirer, or as otherwise required under the DGCL or
the CCC, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of
any Dissenting Shares. Subject to Section 8.2, the payout of consideration
under this Agreement to the Company Securityholders (other than in respect of
Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated as provided in this Section 1.3(e)
and under the DGCL or the CCC) shall not be affected by the exercise or
potential exercise of appraisal rights or dissenters rights under the DGCL
or the CCC by any other Company Stockholder.

(f) _Rights Not Transferable_. The rights of the Company Securityholders
under this Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time are
personal to each such Company Securityholder and shall not be transferable for
any reason, other than by operation of law, will or the laws of descent and
distribution without action taken by or on behalf of such Company
Securityholder. Any attempted transfer of such right by any holder thereof
(other than as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null
and void.

 

(g) _No Interest_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
except as provided in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the cash amounts
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, no interest shall accumulate on any cash payable
in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

(h) _General Release of Claims_. Effective as of, and contingent upon, the
Closing, and in partial consideration for receiving a portion of the Merger
Consideration under this Agreement and for Acquirer entering into this
Agreement, each Company Securityholder (for himself, herself or itself and on
behalf of his, her or its heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns) hereby (i) except as set forth in this Section 1.3(h), forever fully
and irrevocably waives any and all defenses against, claims against, including
any claims for contribution from, and other rights to recourse against, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons based on any
claim that the Company (or any predecessor thereof) engaged in any
misrepresentation or breached any representation or warranty or that a
representation or warranty of the Company was inaccurate when made, or that
the Company breached or was in noncompliance with any covenants or other
obligations given or made by, or terms agreed to by, the Company, in each
case, in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, including the Spreadsheet
and the Company Closing Financial Certificate irrespective of whether or not
such Spreadsheet or Company Closing Financial Certificate, and the information
contained therein and the calculations thereon or therein, are complete or
deviate from the terms set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or any
other organizational documents of the Company (collectively, the " _Waived
Rights_ "); (ii) forever fully and irrevocably releases and discharges (A) the
Company and the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates and
Representatives (in their capacities as such) (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, Acquirer) (collectively, the " _Company Released Parties_ ") from any
and all Liabilities and claims, of any kind or nature, in law or equity,
whether fixed, contingent or absolute, asserted or unasserted, matured or
unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, accrued or not accrued, known or
unknown, due or to become due, vested or contingent, suspected or unsuspected
and whether or not concealed or hidden and however arising, whichever have or
may have existed, or which do exist, that may now or hereafter at any time be
made or brought against any Company Released Party and that relate to or
arise out of any facts, matters or circumstances existing as of or prior

 



12  to the Closing (collectively, the " _Company Released Claims_ "), and (B)
the Acquirer and its Affiliates and Representatives (in their capacity as
such) (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Released Parties)
(collectively, the " _Acquirer Released Parties_ " and, together with the
Company Released Parties, the " _Released Parties_ ") from any and
all Liabilities and claims, of any kind or nature, in law or equity, whether
fixed, contingent or absolute, asserted or unasserted, matured or unmatured,
liquidated or unliquidated, accrued or not accrued, known or unknown, due or
to become due, vested or contingent, suspected or unsuspected and whether or
not concealed or hidden and however arising, whichever have or may have
existed, or which do exist, that may now or hereafter at any time be made or
brought against any Acquirer Released Party, in each case within this clause
(B) only as relates in any way to (x) the Company Securityholders interest in
the Company Capital Stock or Company Options, (y) the Companys operations or
(z) any relationship (written or oral) between such Company Securityholder or
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Company Released Parties, on
the other hand in connection with such Company Securityholders interest in or
with the Company or this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents,
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(within this clause (B), the " _Acquirer Released Claims_ " and, together
with the Company Released Claims, the " _Released Claims_ "); and (iii)
irrevocably covenants and agrees not to, directly or indirectly, assert any
Released Claim or commence (or cause to be commenced) any Legal Proceeding
against any Released Party based in whole or in part upon any Released Claim.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Released Claims does not include claims made
with respect to the payment of the Merger Consideration or the Per Share
Merger Consideration, or any rights to continuing indemnification, exculpation
or expense advancement to the extent provided under (A) the organizational
documents of the Company (B) any indemnification agreement to which
the Company Securityholder and the Company are parties or (C) any applicable
policy of directors and officers insurance maintained by the Company. No
Company Securityholder shall be entitled to contribution from, subrogation to
or recovery against any Released Party with respect to any losses or
Liabilities imposed on or incurred by any Company Securityholder in connection
with any Released Claim. The Company Securityholders recognize that they may
have claims of which they are totally unaware and unsuspecting, but that
which they are nevertheless releasing and giving up by providing the general
release set forth above and in the Company Securityholders Letter of
Transmittal and Option Consent, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 1.3(h), the foregoing releases, waivers and
covenants shall not apply to any (i) defenses, claims and other rights to
recourse that may be asserted by any Company Securityholder to enforce (A)
against Acquirer and the other Company Securityholders the rights of such
Company Securityholder and (B) the obligations of Acquirer and the other
Company Securityholders, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B),
under, but subject to the terms of, this Agreement, the Stockholder
Agreement, the Letter of Transmittal and the other Transaction Documents, as
the case may be; provided that, this clause (i) shall not permit any Company
Securityholder to raise a defense against, make any claims against, including
any claims for contribution from, or assert any other rights to recourse
against, the Released Parties, or any of them, with respect to any Waived
Right or any Released Claim (it being understood that each Company
Securityholder shall not be precluded from enforcing any of its rights or
defenses provided to or retained by it under, but subject to, this Agreement
or from asserting a claim for breach by Acquirer of this Agreement, in
each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein) (ii)
claims

 



13  relating to regular salary earned by, benefits and/or unreimbursed expenses
accrued but unpaid to, any Company Securityholder as of the Closing in his or
her capacity as an employee of the Company as of the Closing, (iii) subject
to the provisions contained in this Agreement, claims by any Company
Securityholder (if such Company Securityholder is a current or former director
or officer of the Company) pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws, any indemnification agreement between the Company and such Company
Securityholder that is set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter, or any
current or former directors and officers insurance policy or
other fiduciary insurance policy maintained by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for the benefit of the Company Securityholder (if the Company
Securityholder is a current or former director or officer of the Company) for
indemnity, insurance benefits or reimbursement of expenses arising out of any
claim brought against such Company Securityholder (if the Company
Securityholder is a current or former director or officer of the Company) in
his capacity as a director or officer of the Company, (iv) claims relating to
amounts owed under any independent consultant, contractor or advisor agreement
set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter to this Agreement but only if such
amounts are Transaction Expenses or taken into account in the calculation of
Company Net Working Capital, (v) any defenses, claims and other rights to
recourse of the Company Securityholders that are necessary to enable the
Securityholders Agent or such Company Securityholder to defend any claim for
indemnification asserted by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement,
including with respect to the release of the Indemnity Escrow Fund; _provided_
that, this clause (v) shall not permit any Company Securityholder or
the Securityholders Agent to raise a defense against, make any claims
against, including any claims for contribution from, or assert any other
rights to recourse against, the Released Parties, or any of them, with respect
to any Waived Right or any Released Claim (it being understood that the
Company Securityholder shall not be precluded from enforcing any of its rights
or defenses provided to or retained by it under, but subject to, this
Agreement or from asserting a claim for breach by Acquirer of this Agreement,
in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein),
(vi) other than with respect to any Waived Rights or any Released Claim that
is released, discharged or the subject of a covenant or agreement not to
assert such Waived Right or Released Claim or commence a Legal Proceeding
based in whole or in part on such Waived Right or Released Claim, claims which
may not be waived as a matter of Applicable Law, and (vii) defenses, claims
and other rights to recourse of any Company Securityholder that are not
related in any way to the Company or its businesses or operations, this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. It is understood that if there is any conflict (other than
with respect to validity and/or enforceability) between the release and
discharge provided by a Company Stockholder in a Stockholder Agreement, and
the general release set forth in this Section 1.3(h) or in the Letter of
Transmittal, the release set forth in the Stockholder Agreement shall control
to the extent of such conflict, and the general release above and in the
Letter of Transmittal shall not be enforced against such Company Stockholder
to the extent of any such conflict. It is further understood and agreed that
all rights under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of California and any similar
law are hereby expressly waived by each Company Securityholder. Said section
reads as follows:

"CERTAIN CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY GENERAL RELEASE. A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT
EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS
OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR
HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

 



14 1.4 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, to the extent
not previously delivered, Acquirer shall mail, or cause to be mailed, a
letter of transmittal in customary form together with instructions for use
thereof in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit J (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") to every holder of record of Company Capital Stock that
was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Letter
of Transmittal shall specify delivery instructions for the certificates or
instruments that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued
and outstanding Company Capital Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and shall
include an agreement to be bound by the provisions of Section 1.5 and Article
VIII and agree to release the Company and the Surviving Corporation from any
claims, rights, Liabilities and causes of action whatsoever based upon,
relating to or arising out of the Certificates, the Merger and/or the
Transactions.

 

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, Acquirer shall cause
to be deposited with JPMorgan Chase, N.A. or other bank or trust company as
Acquirer may choose in its discretion (the " _Paying Agent_ ") the portion of
the Merger Consideration payable to Company Stockholders pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(i) in respect of their shares of Company Capital Stock, subject to
Section 1.3(a)(ii) and Section 1.4(c).

(iii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documentation required thereby,
(A) the holder of record of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive,
subject to any Equity Agreement and Section 1.3(a)(ii), the amount of cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) in
respect of such Certificate, less such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share
of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund Amount and (B) such
Certificate shall be cancelled.

 

(iv) Upon receipt of written confirmation of the effectiveness of the Merger
from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Acquirer will instruct
the Paying Agent to pay, subject to any applicable Equity Agreement and
Section 1.3(a)(ii), to each Company Stockholder by check or wire transfer of
same-day funds the aggregate amount of cash payable to such Indemnifying
Holder pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i), less such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata
Share of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund Amount, other than
in respect of Dissenting Shares to holders thereof, as promptly as
practicable following the submission of a Certificate to the Paying Agent and
a duly executed Letter of Transmittal by such Indemnifying Holder.

 



15 (v) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such document to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquirer or the Paying Agent,
the payment of any reasonable fees and the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amounts as Acquirer may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such document, the Paying Agent
will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed document the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(i) in respect of their shares of Company Capital Stock, less the
applicable portion of such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund Amount. 

(b) _Surrender of Cash-Out Options and Designated Options_. Acquirer shall,
within 15 days following the Closing Date, cause the Option Payments to be
paid to each Company Optionholder holding Cash-Out Options, _less_ an amount
in cash equal to (i) such Company Optionholders Pro Rata Share of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount _plus_ (ii) such Company Optionholders Pro Rata Share
of the Expense Fund Amount (the " _Closing Cash-Out Payment_"),
through Acquirers or the Surviving Corporations payroll system in
accordance with standard payroll practices, and subject to any required
withholding for applicable Taxes; _provided_ that such payment to such Company
Optionholder shall be made only if such Company Optionholder shall have
delivered a duly executed Option Consent prior to the Closing Date; provided,
further, however, that in the event such Company Optionholder delivers a duly
executed Option Consent after the Closing Date and prior to the end of the
calendar year of the Closing, Acquirer shall cause such Closing Cash-Out
Payment to be paid to such Company Optionholder not later than the earlier of
(i) the second regularly scheduled payroll date following delivery of such
executed Option Consent, and (ii) the end of the calendar year of the Closing.
Designated Option Payments to a Company Optionholder holding Designated
Options shall be made only if such Company Optionholder shall have delivered
a duly executed Designated Option Consent prior to the Closing Date.

(c) _Indemnity Escrow and Expense Fund Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the other provisions of this Article I, Acquirer shall
withhold from each Indemnifying Holders applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration payable to such Indemnifying Holder solely pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(i), Section 1.3(a)(ii), Section 1.3(a)(iii)(A) and Section 1.3(a)(iv)
such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and
the Expense Fund Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the full amount of each
Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the
Expense Fund Amount shall, to the maximum extent possible, be funded out of
and reduce the amount that such Indemnifying Holder would otherwise be paid
on the Closing Date or within 30 days after the Closing Date and not subject
to Repurchase Rights or other restrictions. Any Unvested Cash so placed in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund shall vest prior to any Unvested Cash not placed in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall constitute partial
security for the benefit of Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other
Indemnified Person) with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the
indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Holders under Section 1.6(h)
and Article VIII, and shall be held and distributed in accordance with Section
1.6(h) and Section 8.1. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval 

 



16  of the principal terms of the Merger by the Company Stockholders shall
constitute, among other things, approval of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and
the Expense Fund Amount, the withholding of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and
the Expense Fund Amount by Acquirer and the appointment of the
Securityholders Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

(i) Absent a change in applicable law following the date hereof or a
determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, no party hereto shall take any action or filing
position inconsistent with the following characterization: the portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount allocable to the Company Optionholders holding Cash-
Out Options is not intended to be compensation or wages, or subject to
withholding as such, unless and until such portion (or any part thereof) is
distributed to the persons who held Cash-Out Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.3(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate or Company Option surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that such Certificate or
Company Option shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to
Acquirer or any agent designated by Acquirer any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of cash in any name other than that of the
registered holder of such Certificate or Company Option, or established to the
satisfaction of Acquirer or any agent designated by Acquirer that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.4, no party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Applicable Law.

 

(f) _Unclaimed Consideration_. Each holder of a Certificate or Company Option
who has not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in
and contemplated by this Section 1.4 shall look only to Acquirer (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar Applicable Law) for such holders
claim, only as a general unsecured creditor of Acquirer, to any portion of
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such
Certificate or Company Option. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if any Certificate or Company Option has not been
surrendered prior to the earlier of the first anniversary of the Effective
Time and such date on which the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such Certificate or Company
Option would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate or
Company Option shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Acquirer, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

1.5 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Capital Stock or
Company Options_. The applicable portion of the Merger Consideration paid or
payable following the surrender for exchange of the Certificates and Company
Options in accordance with this Agreement shall be paid or payable in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock
represented by such Certificates or issuable pursuant to such Company Options,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving 

 



17  Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Options that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or document or instrument representing a
Company Option is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such
Certificate or Company Option shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

 

1.6 _Company Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(a) Pursuant to Section 5.13, the Company shall deliver the Company Closing
Financial Certificate to Acquirer not later than three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing, Acquirer may object to the calculation
of Company Net Working Capital included in the Company Closing Financial
Certificate (the " _NWC Calculations_ ") by delivering to the Securityholders
Agent a notice (the " _Acquirer NWC Notice_ ") setting forth Acquirers
calculation of Company Net Working Capital and the amount by which Company Net
Working Capital as calculated by Acquirer differs from Company Net Working
Capital as set forth in the Company Closing Financial Certificate, in each
case together with supporting documentation, information and calculations
(which shall include an itemized list of the elements of Company Net Working
Capital).

 

(c) The Securityholders Agent may object to the calculation of Company Net
Working Capital set forth in the Acquirer NWC Notice by providing written
notice of such objection to Acquirer within 20 days after Acquirers delivery
of the Acquirer NWC Notice (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), together with
supporting documentation, information and calculations. Any matters not
expressly set forth in the Notice of Objection shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Securityholders Agent on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders.

 

(d) If the Securityholders Agent timely provides the Notice of Objection,
then Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall confer in good faith for a
period of up to 10 Business Days following Acquirers timely receipt of the
Notice of Objection in an attempt to resolve any disputed matter set forth in
the Notice of Objection, and any resolution by them shall be in writing and
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and the Indemnifying Holders.

(e) If, after the 10 Business Day period set forth in Section 1.6(d),
Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent cannot resolve any matter set forth in
the Notice of Objection, then Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall
engage Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm is not able or willing to so act,
another auditing firm reasonably acceptable to both Acquirer and the
Securityholders Agent (the " _Reviewing Accountant_ ") to review only the
matters in the Notice of Objection that are still disputed by Acquirer and
the Securityholders Agent and the NWC Calculations to the extent relevant
thereto. After such review and a review of the Companys relevant books and
records, the Reviewing Accountant shall promptly (and in any event within 60
days following its engagement) determine the resolution of such remaining
disputed matters, which determination shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and the Indemnifying Holders, and the Reviewing Accountant
shall provide Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent with a calculation of
Company Net Working Capital in accordance with such determination.

 



18 (f) After the Company Net Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.6(b), Section 1.6(d) and/or Section 1.6(e), as the case may be (the
" _Final Net Working Capital_ "), the Merger Consideration shall be
recalculated (as so recalculated, the " _Final Merger Consideration_ ") using
(I) the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working Capital is greater than
the Closing Net Working Capital Target in such calculation instead of the
Closing Net Working Capital Surplus or (II) the amount, if any, by which
Final Net Working Capital is less than the Closing Net Working Capital Target
instead of the Closing Net Working Capital Shortfall. If the Final Merger
Consideration is less than the Merger Consideration (such difference, the "
_Final Shortfall_ "), then the Indemnifying Holders hereby severally but not
jointly indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer without any dispute by the
Securityholders Agent, for the full amount of: (i) the Final Shortfall; and
(ii) all fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant to be paid by
the Indemnifying Holders pursuant to Section 1.6(g)(ii) or Section
1.6(g)(iii), if any. If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than
the Merger Consideration (such difference, the " _Final Surplus_ "), the
Acquirer shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Holders in accordance with
their Pro Rata Shares (i) the Final Surplus and (ii) all fees, costs
and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant to be paid by the Indemnifying
Holders pursuant to Section 1.6(g)(ii) or Section 1.6(g)(iii), if any.

 

(g) The fees, costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant shall be paid (i)
by Acquirer in the event the difference between the Final Net Working Capital
as determined by the Reviewing Accountant pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and the
NWC Calculations set forth in the Acquirer NWC Notice (such difference, the "
_Acquirer_ __ _s Difference_ ") is greater than the difference between the
Final Net Working Capital as determined by the Reviewing Accountant pursuant
to Section 1.6(e) and the NWC Calculations set forth in the Notice of
Objection (such difference, the " _Securityholders_ __ _Agent_ __ _s
Difference_ "), (ii) by the Indemnifying Holders if the Acquirers Difference
is less than the Securityholders Agents Difference or (iii) equally by
Acquirer on the one hand, and the Indemnifying Holders on the other hand, if
the Acquirers Difference is the same as the Securityholders Agents
Difference.

 

(h) Acquirers right to indemnification pursuant to this Section 1.6 will not
be subject to any of the limitations set forth in Article VIII. Any payments
made pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be treated as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted
under Applicable Law.

 

(i) For clarity, except as set forth in Sections 8.2(a)(iv), (v), (x), and
(xiv), the process set forth in this Section 1.6 shall be the exclusive
remedy of Parent and the Securityholders Agent for disputes related to the
NWC Calculations, Acquirer NWC Notice, and Notice of Objection and amounts set
forth therein.

 

1.7 _Tax Consequences_. Neither Acquirer nor Merger Sub makes any
representations or warranties to the Company or to any Company Securityholder
regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any of the Tax consequences to
the Company, Affiliates or any Company Securityholder of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions or the other agreements contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the Company and the Company
Securityholders are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and the other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement.

 



19 1.8 _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the applicable
Company Securityholder when due, and such Company Securityholder shall, at its
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other Taxes and fees.

 

1.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments of
cash pursuant to this Agreement to any Named Employee, any Continuing Employee
or any holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Company
Warrants or Certificates or other designated payee in a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, such amounts in cash as Acquirer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to any such payments under the Code or any provision of state,
local, provincial or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and remitted to or credited by the appropriate Tax Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Persons in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

1.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action
necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

All reserves that are set forth in or reflected in the Company Balance Sheet
have been established in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and are
adequate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company has
not ever guaranteed any debt or other obligation of any other Person.

 

(c) Schedule 2.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Company Debt, including, for each item of
Company Debt, the agreement governing the Company Debt and the interest rate,
maturity date, any assets securing such Company Debt and any prepayment or
other penalties payable in connection with the repayment of such Company Debt
at the Closing.

(d) Schedule 2.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the names and
locations of all banks and other financial institutions at which the Company
maintains accounts and the names of all Persons authorized to make withdrawals
therefrom.

(e) The accounts receivable of the Company (collectively, the " _Accounts
Receivable_ ") as reflected on the Company Balance Sheet and as will be
reflected in the Company Closing Financial Certificate arose in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and represent _bona fide_
claims against debtors for sales and other charges, and have been collected or
are collectible in the book amounts thereof __ within 60 days following the
Agreement Date, less an amount not in excess of the allowance for doubtful
accounts provided for in the Company Balance Sheet or in the Company Closing
Financial Certificate, as the case may be. Allowances for doubtful accounts
and warranty returns have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied and in accordance with the Companys past practice and are sufficient
to provide for any losses that may be sustained on realization of the
applicable Accounts Receivable. The Accounts Receivable arising after the
Company Balance Sheet Date and before the Closing Date (i) arose or shall
arise in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii)
represented or shall represent _bona fide_ claims against debtors for sales
and other charges and (iii) have been collected or are collectible in the book
amounts thereof within 60 days following the Agreement Date, less allowances
for doubtful accounts and warranty returns determined in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied and the Companys past practice that are or shall
be sufficient to provide for any losses that may be sustained on realization
of the applicable Accounts Receivable. None of the Accounts Receivable is
subject to any claim of offset, recoupment, set-off or counter-claim and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances (whether
asserted or unasserted) that could give rise to any such claim. No
material amount of Accounts Receivable is contingent upon the performance by
the Company of any obligation or Contract other than normal warranty repair

 



26  and replacement. No Person has any Encumbrance on any Accounts Receivable,
and no agreement for deduction or discount has been made with respect to any
such Accounts Receivable. Schedule 2.4(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth, as of the Agreement Date, an aging of the Accounts Receivable in
the aggregate and by customer, and indicates the amounts of allowances for
doubtful accounts and warranty returns. Schedule 2.4(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the Agreement Date, such amounts of
Accounts Receivable that are subject to asserted warranty claims by customers
and reasonably detailed information regarding asserted warranty claims made
within the last year, including the type and amounts of such claims.

(f) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal
accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances (i) that
transactions, receipts and expenditures of the Company are being executed and
made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the
Board, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (B) to
maintain accountability for assets, (iii) regarding the prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
the Company and (iv) that the amount recorded for assets on the books and
records of the Company is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
None of the Company, the Companys independent auditors and accountants and,
to the knowledge of the Company, any current or former employee, consultant or
director of the Company has identified or been made aware of any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves Companys management or other current
or former employees, consultants, or directors of the Company who have a role
in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by the Company, or any claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing. Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Representative of the Company has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, in each case, regarding deficient accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or its internal
accounting controls or any material inaccuracy in the Companys financial
statements. No attorney representing the Company, whether or not employed by
the Company, has reported to the Board or any committee thereof or to any
director or officer of the Company evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company
its Representatives. There are no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys internal controls that
could adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data. There has been no change in the Companys accounting
policies since the Companys inception, except as described in the Financial
Statements.

2.5 _Absence of Changes_. Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, (i) the
Company has conducted the Business only in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not occurred any event that is
material and adverse with respect to the Company, and (iii) the Company has
not done, caused or permitted any action that would constitute a breach of
Section 4.2 if such action were taken by the Company without the written
consent of Acquirer, between the Agreement Date and the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time.

 



27 2.6 _Litigation_. There is no Legal Proceeding to which the Company is a party
pending before any Governmental Entity, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company, any of its assets or any of its directors,
officers or employees (in their capacities as such or relating to their
employment, services or relationship with the Company), and to the knowledge
of the Company, there is not any reasonable basis for any such Legal
Proceeding. There is no Order against the Company, or any of its assets, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any of the Companys directors, officers or
employees (in their capacities as such or relating to their employment,
services or relationship with the Company). To the knowledge of the Company,
there is no reasonable basis for any Person to assert a claim against the
Company or any of its assets or any of the Companys directors, officers or
employees (in their capacities as such or relating to their employment,
services or relationship with the Company) based upon: (i) the Company
entering into this Agreement, any of the Transactions or the agreements
contemplated by this Agreement, including a claim that such director, officer
or employee breached a fiduciary duty in connection therewith, (ii) breach by
Company of any confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the
Company regarding its assets or (iii) any claim that the Company has agreed to
sell or dispose of any of its assets to any party other than Acquirer, whether
by way of merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise. The Company
does not have any Legal Proceeding pending against any other Person.

2.7  _Restrictions on Business Activities_. There is no Contract or Order
binding upon the Company that restricts or prohibits, purports to restrict or
prohibit, has or would reasonably be expected to have, whether before or after
consummation of the Merger, the effect of prohibiting, restricting or
impairing any current or proposed business practice of the Company before the
consummation of the Merger, any acquisition of property by the Company or the
conduct or operation of the Business or, excluding restrictions and other
limitations on the use of Third-Party Intellectual Property contained in the
applicable written license agreement therefor, limiting the freedom of the
Company to (i) engage or participate, or compete with any other Person, in
any line of business, market or geographic area with respect to the Company
Products or the Company Intellectual Property, or to make use of any Company
Intellectual Property, including any grants by the Company of

foregoing consents, licenses, permits, grants and other authorizations,
collectively, the " _Company Authorizations_ _"_ ), and all of the Company
Authorizations are in full force and effect. The Company has not received any
notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity regarding (i) any

 



28  actual or possible violation of any Company Authorization or (ii) any actual
or possible revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or
modification of any Company Authorization, and to the knowledge of the
Company, no such notice or other communication is forthcoming. The Company has
materially complied with all of the terms of the Company Authorizations and
none of the Company Authorizations will be terminated or impaired, or will
become terminable, in whole or in part, as a result of the consummation of the
Transactions.

to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code
effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or has

such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or has been established under a standardized prototype

true, correct and complete copy of the most recent IRS determination or
opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and

Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. The Company has
provided to Acquirer all registration statements and prospectuses prepared in
connection with each Company Employee Plan. All individuals who, pursuant to

and the Company and each ERISA Affiliate has performed all obligations
required to be performed by it under, is not in default under or in violation
of, and has no knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to,

Plans. All contributions required to be made by the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before
their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to
each Company Employee Plan for the current plan years (and no further
contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the Closing
Date, other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice after the Company Balance Sheet Date as a result
of the operations of the Company after the Company Balance Sheet Date). In
addition, with respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to include a
Code Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company and each of the ERISA Affiliates
have at all times made timely deposits of employee salary
reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as determined
pursuant to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor. No Company
Employee Plan is covered by, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV of ERISA or

would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Employee
Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to such Company
Employee Plan for the most recent full fiscal year included in the Financial
Statements.

maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, or has ever

thereof. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
reasonable review and approval by Acquirer. The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as
Acquirer may reasonably require. In the event that termination of the

the stockholder vote (the " _280G Stockholder Approval_ ") or (ii) that the
280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such

Agent following the Escrow Release Date with respect to pending but
unresolved claims for indemnification that is not awarded to Acquirer upon the
resolution of such claims shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the
Paying Agent or Acquirer, as applicable, for distribution to the Indemnifying
Holders within five (5) Business Days following resolution of such claims and
in accordance with each such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of such
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

8.3 _Indemnifiable Damage Threshold; Other Limitations_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnified
Person may make a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Fund in respect of any
claim for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 8.2(a)
(other than claims arising out of, resulting from or in connection with (i)
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by or on behalf of
the Company or such Indemnifying Holder or (ii) any failure of any of the
Special Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid) unless and until
a Claim Certificate (together with any other delivered Claim Certificates)
describing Indemnifiable Damages in an aggregate amount greater than $500,000
(the " _Basket_ ") has been delivered, in which case the Indemnified Person
may make claims for indemnification, compensation and reimbursement and may
receive cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund for all Indemnifiable Damages
(including the amount of the Basket). The Basket shall not apply to any
other Indemnifiable Damages or claims therefor.

(b) If the Merger is consummated, the total Liability of an Indemnifying
Holder for the indemnity obligations of each Indemnifying Holder under this
Agreement for Indemnifiable Damages (and not specific performance or other
equitable remedies) arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the
matters listed in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 8.2(a) shall be the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, except (i) in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by or on behalf of the Company or such
Indemnifying Holder and (ii) any failure of any of (A) the Designated
Representations and/or IP Representations, or (B) the representations or
warranties made by the Company in any certificate delivered to Acquirer
pursuant to this Agreement that are within the scope of those covered by the
Designated Representations or the IP Representations (collectively, the "
_Special_

 



82   __ _Representations_ ") to be true and correct as aforesaid. For purposes
of this Agreement: (i) " _Designated Representations_ " shall mean the
representations and warranties made by the Company in Section 2.1(a)
(Organization, Standing, Power and Subsidiaries), Section 2.2 (Capital
Structure), Section 2.3 (Authority; Non-contravention), Section 2.9 (Title
to, Condition and Sufficiency of Assets), Section 2.14 (Taxes), Section
2.15(a) through (d) (Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Matters), Section
2.22 (Environmental, Health and Safety Matters), and Section 2.27 (Settlement
Agreement); and (ii) " _IP Representations_ " shall mean the representations
and warranties made by the Company in Sections 2.10 (Intellectual Property),
2.11 (Information Technology), 2.12 (Privacy and Personal Data), and 2.13
(Company Websites). In no event shall the IP Representations be deemed to
include the representations and warranties made by the Company in Section
2.27 (Settlement Agreement) (the " _Settlement Agreement Representations_ ").

(c) In the case of any claims for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the failure of any of the Special
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or the matters listed in
clauses (iii) through (xix) of Section 8.2(a) (collectively, " _Special
Claims_ "), after Indemnified Persons have exhausted or made claims upon all
amounts of cash held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (after taking into account
all other claims for indemnification, compensation and reimbursement from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund made by Indemnified Persons), or following the Escrow
Release Date, each Indemnifying Holder shall have Liability for such
Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of the amount of any Indemnifiable
Damages resulting therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, (i) the total Liability of an Indemnifying Holder for
Special Claims shall be limited to the aggregate amount of cash payable to
such Indemnifying Holder pursuant to Section 1.3(a) (inclusive of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount); _provided_ that such Indemnifying Holders total
Liability with respect to any failure of the IP Representations (or in
any certificate delivered to Acquirer pursuant to this Agreement that are
within the scope of those covered by such Section) to be true and correct as
aforesaid shall be limited to 50% of the aggregate amount of cash payable to
such Indemnifying Holder pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i), Section 1.3(a)(ii),
Section 1.3(a)(iii)(A) and Section 1.3(a)(iv) (inclusive of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount), and (ii) any limitation of Liability in this Section 8.3(c)
shall not apply in the case of any claims for Indemnifiable Damages arising
out of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses
(xii), (xiii), (xvii) of Section 8.2(a) and in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct (x) by or on behalf of the Company of
which such Indemnifying Holder had actual knowledge after inquiry reasonable
to the circumstances of such Indemnifying Holder or (y) by or on behalf of
such Indemnifying Holder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the limits on Liability of the Indemnifying Holders with respect to
any failure of the IP Representations (or in any certificate delivered to
Acquirer pursuant to this Agreement that are within the scope of those
covered by such Section) shall not apply to the failure of any of the
Settlement Agreement Representations or clause (xii) of Section 8.2(a).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the amounts
that an Indemnified Person recovers from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant
to Special Claims shall not reduce the amount that an Indemnified Person may
recover with respect to claims that are not Special Claims. By way of
illustration and not limitation, assuming there are no other claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, in the event that
Indemnifiable Damages resulting from a Special Claim are first satisfied from
the Indemnity

 



83  Escrow Fund and such recovery fully depletes the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the
maximum amount recoverable by an Indemnified Person pursuant to a subsequent
claim that is not a Special Claim shall continue to be the full dollar value
of the Indemnity Escrow Fund irrespective of the fact that the Indemnity
Escrow Amount was used to satisfy such Special Claim, such that the amount
recoverable for such two claims would be the same regardless of the
chronological order in which they were made.

(e) If at any time after the Indemnified Persons have exhausted or made claims
upon all amounts of cash held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (after taking into
account all other claims for indemnification, compensation and reimbursement
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund made by the Indemnified Persons), or the Escrow
Release Date shall have occurred, and an Indemnifying Holder shall have
Liability for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to this Article VIII in respect
of any Special Claims, then, in satisfaction of such Liability, Acquirer shall
have the right, but not the obligation from time to time to offset and reduce
the amount to be paid to such Indemnifying Holder after Closing pursuant to
any Equity Agreement by up to the amount of such Liability.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no event
shall any Indemnifying Holder have Liability for Indemnifiable Damages for
(A) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by another
Indemnifying Holder in this Agreement, (B) breach of any covenant by any other
Indemnifying Holder in this Agreement or (C) any fraud committed by any other
Indemnifying Holder, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Holder
participated in or had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy, breach or fraud,
and (ii) in no event may any Special Claim be asserted against
any Indemnifying Holder unless and until the Indemnified Persons have
exhausted or made claims upon all amounts of cash held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund (after taking into account all other claims for indemnification,
compensation and reimbursement from the Indemnity Escrow Fund made by
Indemnified Persons), except with respect to any fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach by or on behalf of such Indemnifying
Holder.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) no
Indemnifying Holder shall have any right of indemnification, compensation,
reimbursement, contribution or right of advancement from Acquirer, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnified Person (based upon such
Indemnifying Holders position as an officer, director, employee or agent of
the Company or otherwise) with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages claimed
by any Indemnified Person or any right of subrogation against the Company or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to any indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement of an Indemnified Person by reason of any of the matters set
forth in Section 8.2(a), (ii) the rights and remedies of the Indemnified
Persons after the Effective Time shall not be limited by (x) any investigation
by or on behalf of, or disclosure to (other than in the Company Disclosure
Letter with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 8.2(a), subject to any
limitations expressly set forth therein), any Indemnified Person at or prior
to the Effective Time regarding any failure, breach or other event or
circumstance or (y) any waiver of any condition to the Closing related
thereto, (iii) if an Indemnified Persons claim under this Article VIII may be
properly characterized in multiple ways in accordance with this Article VIII
such that such claim may or may not be subject to different limitations
depending on such characterization, then such Indemnified Person shall have
the right to characterize such claim in a manner that maximizes the recovery
and time

 



84  to assert such claim permitted in accordance with this Article VIII and (iv)
no Indemnifying Holder shall be liable for the breach of any covenant of
another Indemnifying Holder or any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct by or on behalf of any Person other than the Company or
such Indemnifying Holder; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the
liability of an Indemnifying Holder for any fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct (x) by or on behalf of the Company of
which such Indemnifying Holder had actual knowledge after inquiry reasonable
to the circumstances of such Indemnifying Holder or (y) by or on behalf of
such Indemnifying Holder.

(h) All Indemnifiable Damages shall be calculated net of the amount of any
actually recovered by an Indemnified Person prior to the Escrow Release Date
under any existing insurance policies and contractual indemnification or
contribution provisions (in each case, calculated net of any actual collection
costs and reserves, expenses, deductibles or premium adjustments or
retrospectively rated premiums (as determined in good faith by an Indemnified
Person) incurred or paid to procure such recoveries) in respect of any
Indemnifiable Damages suffered, paid, sustained or incurred by
any Indemnified Person; _provided_ that no Indemnified Person shall have any
obligation to seek to obtain or continue to pursue any such recoveries.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company is not
making and shall not be construed to have made, and the Indemnifying Holders
shall not have any liability or indemnification obligation with respect to the
ability of Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to
utilize any Tax asset or attribute (e.g., net operating loss carryforward or
Tax credit carryforward) in any Tax period or portion thereof (including any
Straddle Period) beginning on or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Holders shall not have
any liability or indemnification obligation for any Taxes of the Company (i)
resulting from any election made under Section 338 of the Code with respect to
the Merger; or (ii) resulting from any action taken by the Company after
the Closing.

(j) Any claim for Indemnifiable Damages will be calculated without regard to
any punitive or exemplary damages unless any such punitive or exemplary
damages are actually awarded to a third party by a Governmental Entity.

8.4 _Period for Claims_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.4,
the period (the " _Claims Period_ ") during which claims may be made (i)
against the Indemnity Escrow Fund for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i) and
(ii) of Section 8.2(a) (other than with respect to any of the Special
Representations) shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m.
California time on the Escrow Release Date and (ii) for Indemnifiable Damages
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with all other matters,
including Special Claims (other than with respect to any of the IP
Representations), shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m.
California time on the date that is 90 days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ that the Claims Period for any
failure of any of the IP Representations to be true and correct shall
commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. California time on the
date that is 90 days following the third anniversary of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, such portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund at the Escrow Release Date as in the reasonable
judgment of Acquirer may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or

 



85  unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable Damages specified in any Claim
Certificate delivered to the Securityholders Agent on or prior to the Escrow
Release Date shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund until such claims for
Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved or satisfied. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Claims Period for claims for
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct shall not be
limited.

8.5 _Claims_.

 

(a) From time to time during the Claims Period, Acquirer may deliver to the
Securityholders Agent one or more certificates signed by any officer of
Acquirer (each, a " _Claim_ _Certificate_ "):

(i) stating (to the extent known or reasonably anticipated) that an
Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, or in good faith
believes that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue, Indemnifiable Damages (or
that with respect to any Tax matters, that any Tax Authority may raise such
matter in audit of Acquirer or its subsidiaries, that could give rise to
Indemnifiable Damages);

 

(ii) stating (to the extent known or reasonably anticipated) the amount of
such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of Indemnifiable Damages not
yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the maximum amount believed by
Acquirer in good faith to be incurred, paid, reserved, accrued or demanded by
a third party); and

 

(iii) specifying (to the extent known) in reasonable detail (based upon the
information then possessed by Acquirer) the individual items of such
Indemnifiable Damages included in the amount so stated and the nature of the
claim to which such Indemnifiable Damages are related.

 

(b) Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such officer of Acquirer as of the date thereof, (ii) shall not
limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect to
the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such Claim
Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to time
by Acquirer by delivering any updated or amended Claim Certificate, so long
as the delivery of the original Claim Certificate is made within the
applicable Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to the
underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such original
Claims Certificate; _provided_ that all claims for Indemnifiable Damages
properly set forth in a Claim Certificate or any update or amendment thereto
shall remain outstanding until such claims have been resolved or satisfied,
notwithstanding the expiration of such Claims Period. No delay in providing
such Claim Certificate within the applicable Claims Period shall affect an
Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent
that) the Securityholders Agent or the Indemnifying Holders are materially
prejudiced thereby.

 



86 8.6 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

 

(a) If the Securityholders Agent does not contest, by written notice to
Acquirer, any claim or claims by Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate
within the 20-day period following receipt of the Claim Certificate, then
Acquirer shall reclaim an amount of cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund having
a total value equal to the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages corresponding
to such claim or claims as set forth in such Claim Certificate.

(b) If the Securityholders Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims
by Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within the 20-day period set forth
in Section 8.6(a), Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall attempt in
good faith for 60 days after Acquirers receipt of such written objection to
resolve such objection. If Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent shall so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by both Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent. Acquirer shall be entitled
to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and Acquirer shall reclaim an
amount of cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of
such memorandum. 

(c) If no such agreement can be reached during the 60-day period for good
faith negotiation set forth in Section 8.6(b), but in any event upon the
expiration of such 60-day period, either Acquirer or the Securityholders
Agent may bring an arbitration in accordance with the terms of Section 9.11
to resolve the matter. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate shall be non-appealable, binding
and conclusive upon the parties hereto and the Indemnifying Holders, and
Acquirer shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to
Acquirer an amount of cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance
therewith.

 

(d) Judgment upon any determination of an arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 8.6(d), in any suit
hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Claim
Certificate is at issue, Acquirer shall be deemed to be the prevailing party
unless the arbitrator determines in favor of the Securityholders Agent (on
behalf of the Indemnifying Holders) with respect to more than one-half of the
amount in dispute, in which case the Indemnifying Holders shall be deemed to
be the prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay
its own fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the prevailing party,
including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred in connection with
such suit.

(e) Any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent
following the Escrow Release Date with respect to pending but unresolved
claims for indemnification that is not awarded to Acquirer upon the resolution
of such claims shall be distributed to the Indemnifying Holders within five
Business Days following resolution of such claims and in accordance with each
such Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of such portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund.

 



87 8.7 _Securityholders_ __ _Agent_.

 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Indemnifying Holders and without any further action of any of
the Indemnifying Holders or the Company, at the Closing, Fortis Advisors LLC
shall be constituted and appointed as the Securityholders Agent. The
Securityholders Agent shall be the exclusive agent and attorney in fact for

Agreement, or any other agreement, document or instrument entered into or
executed in connection herewith, for and on behalf of any Indemnifying Holder,
to or from Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person)
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions and any other matters
contemplated by this Agreement or by such other agreement, document or
instrument (except to the extent that this Agreement expressly
contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received
by each Indemnifying Holder individually), (iii) review, negotiate and agree

Section 8.6, (v) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into, or, if

connection with the resolution of any dispute relating hereto or to the
Transactions by arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and take or forego any

foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement, (vi) consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and
other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Holders, (vii) consent or agree to any amendment to this

accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein, (viii)
pursuant to Section 1.6, review, negotiate, object to, accept or agree to
Acquirers calculation of Company Net Working Capital, and (ix) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholders Agent

the foregoing, the Securityholders Agent shall have no obligation to act on
behalf of the Indemnifying Holders, except as expressly provided herein, in
the Escrow Agreement and in the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement,
and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholders
Agent in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure
Letter. Acquirer, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates (including after

the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement, and
all defenses which may be available to any Indemnifying Holder to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders Agent taken in good
faith under this Agreement, the Escrow

 



88  Agreement or the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement are waived.
Acquirer and other Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely exclusively
on any action or decision of the Securityholders Agent. The Person serving
as the Securityholders Agent may be removed or replaced from time to time, or
if such Person resigns from its position as the Securityholders Agent, then a
successor may be appointed, by the holders of a majority in interest of the
aggregate amount of cash then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (or, in the
event that there is no cash then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund by the
Indemnifying Holders collectively having a Pro Rata Share greater than 50%)
upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Acquirer. The immunities
and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders Agent or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing
and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. No bond
shall be required of the Securityholders Agent.

 

(b) Certain Indemnifying Holders have entered into an engagement agreement
(the " _Securityholders  Agent Engagement Agreement_") with the
Securityholders Agent to provide direction to the Securityholders Agent in
connection with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement (such Indemnifying Holders,
including their individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred
to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Securityholders Agent nor its
members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Securityholders  Agent
Group_") shall be liable to any Indemnifying Holder for any act done or
omitted hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the Securityholders
Agent Engagement Agreement as the Securityholders Agent while acting in good
faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Holders shall severally but not jointly
indemnify the Securityholders Agent Group and hold it harmless against any
loss, Liability, claim, damage, fee, cost or expense (including fees,
disbursements and costs of skilled professionals and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or amounts paid in
settlement incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
on the part of the Securityholders Agent and arising out of, resulting from
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the Securityholders Agent
Engagement Agreement including all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably incurred by the
Securityholders Agent (collectively, the " _Securityholders  Agent
Expenses_"). If not paid directly to the Securityholders Agent by the
Indemnifying Holders, such Securityholders Agent __ Expenses may be recovered
by the Securityholders Agent first, from the Expense Fund, and second, from
the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the
Indemnifying Holders (and not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified
Person or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified
Person) on or after the Escrow Release Date pursuant to the terms hereof, at
the time of distribution, and such recovery will be made from the Indemnifying
Holders according to their respective Pro Rata Share of such Securityholders
Agent __ Expenses. The Indemnifying Holders acknowledge that the
Securityholders Agent shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of
any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Furthermore, the Securityholders Agent shall not be required to take any
action unless the Securityholders Agent has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Securityholders Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Securityholders Agent in performing such actions.

 



89 (c) After the Closing, any notice or communication given or received by, and
any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the
Securityholders Agent that is within the scope of the Securityholders
Agents authority under Section 8.7(a) shall constitute a notice or
communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of all the Indemnifying Holders and their successors and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each such Indemnifying Holder and its
successors; and each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively
upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such Indemnifying
Holder. Acquirer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Persons are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such notice, communication, decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of the Securityholders Agent.

 

(d) Acquirer will withhold each Indemnifying Holders Pro Rata Share of
$100,000 (the aggregate amount so withheld from all Indemnifying Holders, the
" _Expense Fund Amount_ ") from the portion of the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable by Acquirer to such Indemnifying Holders pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(i), Section 1.3(a)(ii), Section 1.3(a)(iii)(A) and Section 1.3(a)(iv)
and pay such amount at Closing to the Securityholders Agent (the aggregate
Expense Fund Amount held by the Securityholders Agent at any given time, the
" _Expense Fund_ "). The Expense Fund Amount shall be available for use by
the Securityholders Agent in connection with the performance of the
Securityholders Agents duties and obligations under this Agreement,
the Securityholders Agent Engagement Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
the Securityholders Agent shall pay any amounts remaining in the Expense Fund
to Acquirer for distribution by Acquirer to the Indemnifying Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares at such time as the
Securityholders Agent determines to be appropriate. The Securityholders
Agent is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice
and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of
the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or
in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax
reporting or income distribution obligations. The Indemnifying Holders shall
not receive interest or other earnings on the Expense Fund Amount. For tax
purposes, the Expense Fund Amount shall be treated as having been received
and voluntarily set aside by the applicable Indemnifying Holders following the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, no Indemnifying Holders shall have
any rights in or claims to the Expense Fund Amount.

 

(e) The Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and
(iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on
behalf of the applicable Indemnifying Holder or other party.

 



90 (f) The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the
Securityholders Agent Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Indemnifying Holder and shall be binding on any successor
thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Indemnifying Holder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

 

8.8 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquirer becomes aware of a claim by a
third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that Acquirer in good faith believes
may result in a claim for Indemnifiable Damages by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Person, Acquirer shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve such Third-Party Claim (and
the costs and expenses incurred by Acquirer in connection with such defense,
enforcement, settlement or resolution (including reasonable attorneys fees,
other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall
be included in the Indemnifiable Damages for which Acquirer shall be entitled
to receive indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder, and such costs
and expenses shall constitute Indemnifiable Damages subject to
indemnification under Section 8.2 regardless of whether it is ultimately
determined that such Third-Party Claim arose out of, resulted from or was in
connection with a matter listed in Section 8.2). The Securityholders Agent
shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent that
receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating to any
Indemnified Person, subject to execution by the Securityholders Agent of a
standard non-disclosure agreement to the extent that such materials contain
confidential or propriety information. However, Acquirer shall have the right
in its sole discretion to determine and conduct the defense of any Third-
Party Claim and the settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third-Party
Claim. Unless otherwise consented to in writing in advance by Acquirer in its
sole discretion, the Securityholders Agent and its Affiliates may not
participate in any Third-Party Claim or any action related to such Third-Party
Claim (including any discussions or negotiations in connection with the
settlement, adjustment or compromise thereof); _provided_ ,  _however_ that
except with the consent of the Securityholders Agent (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Holder, such Indemnifying Holder, and in each case such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood and
agreed that it shall be reasonable for the Securityholders Agent or
Indemnifying Person, as applicable, to withhold such consent if it believes in
good faith that there is not any underlying basis for indemnification with
respect to such settlement or resolution)), no settlement or resolution of any
such Third-Party Claim shall be determinative of the existence or the amount
of Indemnifiable Damages resulting from, arising out of or relating to such
Third-Party Claim against or settling such Third-Party Claims. In the event
that the Securityholders Agent has consented to the amount of any settlement
or resolution by Acquirer of any such claim (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which consent shall be
deemed to have been given unless the Securityholders Agent shall have
objected within 30 days after a written request therefor by Acquirer), or
if the Securityholders Agent shall have been determined to have unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed its consent to the amount of any such
settlement or resolution, neither the Securityholders Agent nor any
Indemnifying Holder shall have any power or authority to object under this
Article VIII to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Person against the Indemnity Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such
settlement or resolution.

 



91 8.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Acquirer, the Securityholders
Agent and the Indemnifying Holders agree to treat (and cause their respective
Affiliates to treat) any payment received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Article VIII as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

right to indemnification pursuant to Article VIII in respect of any claim
based upon any breach of a covenant, agreement or obligation shall be
affected by the expiration of such covenant, agreement or obligation.

9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made herein to Articles, Sections,
subsections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article,
Section or subsection of, or a Schedule or an Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The headings contained herein are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Where a reference is made to a Contract, instrument or Applicable Law, such
reference is to such Contract, instrument or Applicable Law as amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts or instruments)
by waiver or consent and (in the case of Applicable Law) by succession of
comparable successor Applicable Law and references to all attachments thereto
and instruments incorporated therein. Unless the context of this Agreement
otherwise requires: (i) words of any gender include each other gender and
neutral forms of such words, (ii) words using the singular or plural number
also include the plural or singular number, respectively, (iii) the terms
"hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereunder" and derivative or similar words
refer to this entire Agreement, (iv) references to clauses without a cross-
reference to a Section or subsection are references to clauses within the same
Section or, if more specific, subsection, (v) references to any person
include the successors and permitted assigns of that person, (vi) references
from or through any date shall mean, unless otherwise specified, from and
including or through and including, respectively, (vii) the phrases "provide
to", "made available" and "deliver to" and phrases of similar import mean that
a true, correct and complete paper or electronic copy of the information or

 



94  material referred to has been delivered to the party to whom such
information or material is to be provided and (viii) the phrases "provided to
Acquirer" or "made available to Acquirer" and phrases of similar import
means, with respect to any information, document or other material of the

connection with this Agreement at least 48 hours prior to the execution of
this Agreement or actually delivered (whether by physical or electronic
delivery) to Acquirer or its Representatives at least 48 hours prior to the
execution of this Agreement. The symbol "$" refers to U.S. Dollars. The word

period shall be deemed to end on the next succeeding Business Day. Unless
indicated otherwise, all mathematical calculations contemplated by this
Agreement shall be rounded to the tenth decimal place, except in respect of
payments, which shall be rounded to the nearest whole U.S. cent.

9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Law, the parties hereto may amend this
Agreement by authorized action at any time pursuant to an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; _provided_ that after
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that by Applicable Law requires further approval by the Company
Stockholders without such further approval. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Acquirer and the Securityholders Agent may cause this
Agreement to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of Acquirer and the Securityholders
Agent.

 

9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto owed to such party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive any breaches of any of the
covenants, agreements, obligations or conditions for the benefit of such party
contained herein. At any time after the Closing, Acquirer and the
Securityholders Agent may, to the extent legally allowed, (A) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other owed to such
party, (B) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
or (C) waive any breaches of any of the covenants, agreements, obligations or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing that
is (I) prior to the Closing with respect to the Company and/or the Company
Securityholders, signed by the Company, (II) after the Closing with respect to
the Company Securityholders and/or the Securityholders Agent, signed by the
Securityholders Agent and (III) with respect to Acquirer and/or Merger Sub,
signed by Acquirer. Without limiting the generality or effect of the preceding
sentence, no failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach
or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same
or any other provision herein.

 



95 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; _it_
_being_ _understood_ _and_   _agreed_ that all parties hereto need not sign
the same counterpart. The delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in
PDF format of this Agreement with all executed signature pages (in
counterparts or otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to
the terms and conditions set forth herein. All of the counterparts will
together constitute one and the same instrument and each counterpart will
constitute an original of this Agreement.

 

9.7 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, the
Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force
and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in
accordance with its terms and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be
construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder (except that Article VIII is intended to benefit
the Indemnified Persons).

9.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights
and obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and
void, except that Acquirer and/or Merger Sub may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of either Acquirer or Acquirers ultimate parent without the
prior consent of any other party hereto; _provided_ that notwithstanding any
such assignment, Acquirer and/or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall remain
liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

9.9 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.10 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party hereto of any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to

 



96  Section 8.3(b), the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby
waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies
described herein.

 

9.11 _Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

 

(a) EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS REGARDING EITHER ACQUIRERS OR THE COMPANYS
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND/OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ACQUIRER, ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES OR THE COMPANY, TO WHICH THIS SECTION WILL NOT APPLY, IN THE
EVENT THAT A RESOLUTION IS NOT REACHED AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO WITHIN 60 DAYS
AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DISPUTE, THE DISPUTE SHALL BE FINALLY SETTLED
BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL
BE CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN
ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION BY ONE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
RULES. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ALLOW SUCH DISCOVERY AS IS APPROPRIATE TO THE
PURPOSES OF ARBITRATION IN ACCOMPLISHING A FAIR, SPEEDY AND COST-EFFECTIVE
RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL REFERENCE THE FEDERAL RULES OF
CIVIL PROCEDURE THEN IN EFFECT IN SETTING THE SCOPE AND TIMING OF DISCOVERY.
THE AWARD OF ARBITRATION SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING UPON THE PARTIES HERETO.
THE ARBITRATOR WILL AWARD TO THE PREVAILING PARTY ALL COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES
RELATED TO THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES OF
ATTORNEYS, ACCOUNTANTS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS INCURRED BY THE PREVAILING
PARTY, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN
ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.

 

(b) Subject to Section 9.11(a), the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California and
the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
California, the place where this Agreement was entered and is to be performed,
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this Agreement and of the documents referred to herein, and in respect of the
Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such a California State or Federal court. The
parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over
the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.2 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding,
venue shall lie solely in the County of Santa Clara, California. A party
hereto may apply either to a court of competent

 



97  jurisdiction or to an arbitrator, if one has been appointed, for prejudgment
remedies and emergency relief pending final determination of a claim pursuant
to this Section 9.11. The appointment of an arbitrator does not preclude a
party hereto from seeking prejudgment remedies and emergency relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction.

 

9.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, all acts and transactions pursuant
hereto and all obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without
reference to such states principles of conflicts of law that would refer a
matter to a different jurisdiction; _provided_ that any matters related
to the effectiveness of the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without reference to such states principles of conflicts of law
that would refer a matter to a different jurisdiction.

 

9.13 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

9.14 _Consent to Representation; Conflict of Interest_. If the
Securityholders Agent so desires, acting on behalf of the Company
Securityholders and without the need for any consent or waiver by the Company,
Acquirer, or Merger Sub, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and
Hachigian LLP (" _Gunderson_ ") shall be permitted to represent the Company
Securityholders after the Closing in connection with any matter, including
anything related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other
agreements referenced herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Gunderson
shall be permitted to represent the Company Securityholders, any of their
agents and Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any
negotiation, transaction, or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration,
or other adversary proceeding) with Acquirer, the Company, or any of their
agents or Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims or
disputes arising under other agreements entered into in connection with this
Agreement, including with respect to any indemnification claims. Acquirer,
Merger Sub, and the Company further agree that, as to all communications among
Gunderson and the Securityholders Agent and the Company Securityholders and
their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege
and the exception of client confidence belongs solely to Acquirer and the
Surviving Corporation and may be controlled only by Acquirer and the Surviving
Corporation. This right to the attorney-client privilege shall exist even if
such communications may exist on the Companys computer system or in documents
in the Companys possession; provided, however, Acquirer agrees that after the
Closing it will not search for and review any confidential communications
that occurred prior to the Closing between Gunderson, on the one hand, and the
Securityholders Agent, the Company Securityholders and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, that solely relate to the Transactions and are
in the possession and control of Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation
following the Closing for the specific purpose of identifying unknown claims
for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement without having an
independent reason, concern or basis for reviewing such confidential
