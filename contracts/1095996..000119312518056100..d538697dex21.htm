and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is agreed as follows:

_ARTICLE 1_

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; CLOSING



   1.1 | _Closing_. The closing of the Transaction (the "Closing") will
take place by electronic mail and overnight courier service on the later to
occur of (i) the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver

---|--- 



   1.2 | _Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests_. On the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, (a)

__ _ 1.3_, and (b) each Class B Seller will sell, assign, convey, transfer
and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase from Membership Interests, free and clear of all Liens (other than restrictions on

_Section_ __ _ 1.3_. 
---|--- 
 



   1.3 | _Payments at Closing_. At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or cause
to be paid, by wire transfer in immediately available funds (without any
withholding or deduction of any kind except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement or otherwise required by Law, which amounts so withheld or deducted
shall be treated for all Tax and other applicable purposes as having been paid
to the Person in respect of whom such withholding or deduction was made)
the following: 
---|--- 



     | 1.3.1 | the Payoff Amounts to the accounts and in the amounts set
forth in the Payoff Letters, and the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses to
the accounts and in the amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement,
in each case, to the extent not paid by or on behalf of the Company and/or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing; 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.3.2 | to the Escrow Agent, an amount equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount for deposit into an escrow account (the "Adjustment Escrow
Account"), to be held for the periods and distributed as provided in the
Escrow Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.3.3 | to the Escrow Agent, an amount equal to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount for deposit into an escrow account (the

as provided in the Escrow Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.3.4 | to the Class A Seller, to the account specified in writing
by the Sellers Representative, an amount equal to the Class A Priority

---|---|--- 
 



     | 1.3.5 | to Sellers, according to each Sellers Pro Rata Portion,
to the accounts specified in writing by the Sellers Representative, the
Estimated Closing Date Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 
 



   1.4 | _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 
---|--- 



     | 1.4.1 | _Estimated Closing Statement_. No later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the date on which the Closing is scheduled to occur,
the Sellers Representative will prepare and furnish to Buyer a statement
(the "Estimated Closing Statement") reflecting the Sellers Representatives
good faith estimates of (a) (i) the Net Asset Value as of 11:59 p.m. on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing
Net Asset Value"), (ii) the Cash of the Acquired Companies as of 11:59 p.m. on
the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing
Cash"), (iii) the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of 11:59 p.m. on
the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include the Payoff Amounts) (the "Estimated
Indebtedness"), and (iv) the Transaction Expenses of the Acquired Companies
as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses"), and (b)
the Sellers Representatives calculation of the Estimated Closing Date
Purchase Price.  
---|---|--- 
 



\- 2 - later than sixty (60) days, after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Sellers Representative a written statement
(the "Closing Statement") setting forth Buyers good faith calculations of
(a)(i) the Net Asset Value as of 11:59 p.m. on the Business Day immediately
prior to the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Asset Value"), (ii) the Cash of
the Acquired Companies as of 11:59 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date (the "Closing Cash"), (iii) the Indebtedness of the
Acquired Companies as of 11:59 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing Date (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Payoff
Amounts) (the "Closing Indebtedness"), and (iv) the Transaction Expenses of
the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Transaction
Expenses"), and (b) Buyers calculation of the Closing Date Purchase Price.
Following delivery of the Closing Statement, and upon reasonable request of
the Sellers Representative, Buyer and the Company will provide the Sellers
Representative and its advisors with access to the Acquired Companies
employees, books and records to the extent reasonably related to the Sellers
Representatives evaluation of the Closing Statement. If Buyer fails to
deliver the Closing Statement within such sixty (60)-day period, the Sellers
Representative will deliver to Buyer the Sellers Representatives
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value, the Closing Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing Date Purchase
Price, and the Sellers Representatives calculation will be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.4.3 | _Dispute Notice_. If the Sellers Representative
disagrees with the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement delivered
by Buyer pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.4.2_, the Sellers Representative
may, within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a
written notice to Buyer (a "Dispute Notice") specifying in reasonable detail
each item or amount that the Sellers Representative disputes (the "Disputed
Items"), the amount in dispute for each Disputed Item and the reasons
supporting the Sellers Representatives positions. The Sellers
Representative will be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement that are not Disputed Items. If the
Sellers Representative fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within such sixty
(60)-day period, Buyers calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value, the
Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Transaction Expenses and
the Closing Date Purchase Price will be deemed accepted by Sellers and the
Sellers Representative and will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.4.4 | _Resolution Period_. If a Dispute Notice is duly
delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4.3_, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative will, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery (the
"Resolution Period"), use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement
on the Disputed Items or amounts in order to determine the amount of the
Closing Net Asset Value, the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Transaction Expenses, and/or the Closing Date Purchase Price, as
applicable. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative are able to reach
agreement with respect to any Disputed Items, Buyer will promptly revise the
Closing Statement to reflect such agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 3 - of the Resolution Period, or any mutually-agreed upon extension of the
Resolution Period, Buyer and the Sellers Representative are unable to reach
agreement on all of the Disputed Items, they will jointly engage and submit
the unresolved Disputed Items (the "Unresolved Items") to the Independent
Accounting Firm for resolution in accordance with the terms of this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.4.5_. The Independent Accounting Firm (i) will act as an
arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by Buyer and the
Sellers Representative and not by independent review, only the Unresolved
Items, (ii) will make a determination with respect to the Unresolved Items
only and in a manner consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 1.4.5_, (iii) will
use the definitions set forth in this Agreement with no consideration given
to any modification of such definitions, (iv) will be limited to those
adjustments, if any, required to be made for the Closing Statement to comply
with the provisions of this Agreement and (v) will make a determination of
the Unresolved Items within the range of Buyers and the Sellers
Representatives disagreement. Each Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and
other documents and information pertaining to the Unresolved Items as the
Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and will be afforded an
opportunity to discuss the Unresolved Items with the Independent
Accounting Firm at such hearing as the Independent Accounting Firm will
request or permit; _provided_ , that (y) each Party will provide the other
Party with a copy of all materials provided to, and communications with, the
Independent Accounting Firm and (x) no Party (or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives) will engage in any _ex parte_ communication with the
Independent Accounting Firm at any time with respect to the Unresolved Items.
The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and the Sellers
Representative as promptly as practicable, and will be instructed to deliver
no later than thirty (30) days after its engagement, a written report setting
forth such calculation. Such determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
will be final, conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Sellers (absent fraud or
manifest error) and Buyer will promptly revise the Closing Statement to
reflect such determination upon receipt of such report. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accounting Firm will be borne pro rata as between Buyer, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, based on the proportionate
deviation of the respective adjustment amounts for the Unresolved Items
proposed by Buyer and the Sellers Representative, as set forth in the
Closing Statement in the case of Buyer and the Dispute Notice in the case of
the Sellers Representative, from the determination of the final adjustment
amounts made by the Independent Accounting Firm. The date on which the
Closing Net Asset Value, the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Transaction Expenses, and Closing Date Purchase Price are finally
determined in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ is referred to as
the "Determination Date." 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.4.6 |

_Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The "Adjustment Amount" means an amount
equal to (i) the Closing Date Purchase Price (as finally agreed upon or
determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_), _less_ (ii) the Estimated
Closing Date Purchase Price. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive amount,
then promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the
Determination Date, (a) Buyer will pay 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 4 - available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing by the
Sellers Representative, each Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Adjustment
Amount and (b) Buyer and the Sellers Representative will deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to
immediately pay to the Sellers Representative, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, all funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account. If
the Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then promptly, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the Determination Date, (x) if
the Adjustment Escrow Amount is greater than or equal to the absolute value
of the Adjustment Amount, Buyer and the Sellers Representative will deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to
immediately pay (i) to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by Buyer, the Adjustment Amount from the
Adjustment Escrow Account and (ii) to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the
Sellers Representative, each Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the remaining funds
in the Adjustment Escrow Account, if any (after deducting an amount equal to
the Adjustment Amount), and (y) if the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount is greater than the absolute value of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, (i)
Buyer and the Sellers Representative will deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to immediately pay to Buyer, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Buyer, all funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account and (ii) Sellers
will pay or cause to be paid to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer, an amount equal
to the amount by which the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is greater
than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, with each Seller being
responsible severally, and not jointly, for its Pro Rata Portion of such
amount. 
---|--- 



     | 1.4.7 | _No Adverse Actions_. Buyer and the Company agree that,
following the Closing and until the Adjustment Amount becomes final and
binding upon the parties to this Agreement, the Company will not take, and

---|---|--- 



     | 5.6.2 | Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, prior to or

cause the Acquired Companies to (and after the Closing, shall cause Sellers
Representative to) use commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyers sole cost
and expense, to respond to any reasonable request of Buyer and the Auditors
in connection with the performance of such audits and/or reviews, including
(a) using their commercially reasonable efforts to provide such financial and
other pertinent information within the knowledge or possession of Sellers or
the Sellers Representative regarding the Acquired Companies as may be

any Financing, and (b) using their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the independent accountants of the Acquired Companies (if different than the

foregoing (including providing consent to Buyer to use any of the audit
reports of the Acquired Companies in connection with any Financing or as may
otherwise be required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and

anniversary thereof. 
---|---|--- 



   5.7 | _Tax Matters_. 
---|--- 



     | 5.7.1 | _Tax Returns_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

The Sellers Representative will be responsible for directing the preparation
and filing of all Income Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that is required to be filed after the Closing Date 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 32 - practices of the Acquired Companies unless otherwise required under applicable
Law. No later than twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing any such
Tax Return, taking into account any extensions of such filing date, the
Sellers Representative will make such Tax Return available for review by
Buyer. With respect to such Tax Return for RSI Communities Realty Inc. or any
other Acquired Company that is not treated as a pass-through entity under such
Tax Return, Buyer will have the right to approve (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) such Tax Return, and the
Sellers Representative will modify such Tax Return, as reasonably and timely
requested by Buyer, before filing. With respect to such Tax Return for any
Acquired Company that is treated as a pass-through entity under such Tax
Return, Buyer will have the right to approve (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) any position taken in any such
Tax Return that could reasonably be expected to result in an increase in the
Taxes of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) in a
Post-Closing Tax Period. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | Buyer will be responsible for directing the preparation and
filing of all other Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired Companies for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods and will prepare such Tax
Returns in accordance with past practices of the Acquired Companies unless
otherwise required under applicable Law. No later than twenty (20) days prior
to the due date for filing any such Tax Return, taking into account any
extensions of such filing date, Buyer will make such Tax Return available for
review and approval by the Sellers Representative (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and will modify such
Tax Return, as reasonably and timely requested by the Sellers
Representative, before filing to the extent Sellers could be liable for any
Taxes (directly or through a claim for indemnification), or could be entitled
to any refund of Taxes, on such Tax Return. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Sellers shall pay, or reimburse Buyer for, in the case of
Tax Returns described in _Section_ __ _ 5.7.1(a)_, all Taxes shown thereon to
be due, and, in the case of Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods described in _Section_ __ _
5.7.1(b)_, the amount of Taxes shown thereon to be due (in the case of such
Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods) or the amount of Taxes shown thereon
to be due and that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date (in the case of such Tax Returns for Straddle Periods),
in each case except to the extent such Taxes were included in the Closing
Statement, as finally determined, and taken into account in the Closing Date
Purchase Price.  
---|---|--- 



     | 5.7.2 |

_Tax Contests_. Buyer, on behalf of the Acquired Companies, will promptly
notify the Sellers Representative in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any
Acquired Company of notice of any Tax audits, examinations or assessments
relating to any 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 33 - Straddle Period or that could give rise to indemnification under _Article 7_
 (each, a " _Tax Contest_ "). The Sellers Representative will control the
portion of any such Tax Contest that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period if
the resolution of the Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on Sellers or their beneficial owners, and Buyer will control
with respect to any other Tax Contest. The Sellers Representative will keep
Buyer reasonably informed of the progress of any Tax Contest that the
Sellers Representative is entitled to control under this _Section_ __ _
5.7.2_, and the Sellers Representative will not settle such Tax Contest
without Buyers prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent such settlement would have an
adverse effect on Buyer. Buyer will keep the Sellers Representative
reasonably informed of the progress of any Tax Contest that Buyer is entitled
to control under this _Section_ __ _ 5.7.2_, and Buyer will not settle such
Tax Contest without the Sellers Representatives prior written consent
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to
the extent such settlement would have an adverse effect on Sellers. To the
extent there is any inconsistency between the provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 5.7.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.7.2_ shall control with respect to Tax Contests. 
---|--- 



     | 5.7.3 | _Tax Refunds_. Any refund of Taxes received by the
Acquired Companies relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (or any election to apply the
right to such a refund as a payment of, or a credit against, future Taxes) (a
"Pre-Closing Tax Refund"), will, to the extent such Taxes were paid by an
Acquired Company prior to the Closing, included in the Closing Statement, as
finally determined (and taken into account in the Closing Date Purchase
Price), or paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Account after the Closing,
be credited to Sellers. Buyer will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, the
amount of any Pre-Closing Tax Refund, including the amount of interest
actually received on any Pre-Closing Tax Refund (but net of (i) taxes payable
by Buyer or any Acquired Company with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Refund
or interest and (ii) reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining such Pre-Closing Tax Refund), to the Sellers
Representative (for distribution to Sellers) upon receipt (or use) of such
Pre-Closing Tax Refund by the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates.
To the extent any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund is subsequently disallowed or
required to be returned to the applicable Taxing Authority, Sellers agree to
promptly repay the amount of such refunds or credits, together with any
interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Taxing
Authority, to Buyer. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.7.4 |

_Books and Records; Cooperation_. Buyer and Sellers will, and will cause their
respective Representatives to, (a) provide the other Party and its
Representatives with such assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other
examination by any Taxing Authority or Proceeding relating to Taxes with
respect to the Acquired Companies and (b) retain (until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which the Tax Returns
relate), and provide the other Party and its Representatives  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 34 - be relevant to such Tax Return (including analysis regarding any Tax refunds
or Tax benefits), audit, examination or proceeding,  _provided_ , that the
foregoing will be done at the expense of the Party making such request and in
a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business
of the Parties. 
---|--- 
 



     | 5.7.5 | _Straddle Period_. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
5.7_, the portion of Tax with respect to the income, property or operations of
the Acquired Companies that is attributable to any Tax period that begins on
or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period") will be apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period that
extends before the Closing Date through the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
Straddle Period") and the portion of the Straddle Period that extends from the
day after the Closing Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the "Post-
Closing Straddle Period") in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.7.5_. The
portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will (a)
in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes,
employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by
income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in
the Straddle Period and (b) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-
added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or
measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be
deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended
on and included the Closing Date. The portion of Tax attributable to a Post-
Closing Straddle Period will be calculated in a corresponding manner. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5.7.6 | _Tax Treatment of Transactions_. For federal and state
income tax purposes, the sale of the Membership Interests by Sellers to Buyer
will be treated, pursuant to Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6: (i) by Buyer,
as a purchase of the assets of the Company (including assets of those
Subsidiaries that are treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal Tax
purposes), and (ii) by Sellers, as a sale of their membership interests in
the Company. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.7.7 | _Post-Closing Actions_. The Parties further agree that,
except as otherwise required by applicable Laws, Buyer will not, without the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, (a) except as
specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.7.1(b)_, file or cause any Acquired
Company to file any Tax Return or amended Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period, (b) except as specifically provided in _Section_ __
_ 5.7.11_, make any election that has any retroactive effect on any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, or (c) take, or cause or permit any
Acquired Company to take, any action on the Closing Date or following the
Closing that would increase Sellers liability for Taxes to any Taxing
Authority or to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or reduce any Pre-Closing
Tax Refund to which Sellers would otherwise be entitled under this _Section_
__ _ 5.7_. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 35 - will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, be reflected on the Income Tax
Returns of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing
Date. Except as otherwise required pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code), none of the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates will take any position inconsistent with such
treatment. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.7.9 | _Purchase Price Allocation_. As soon as practicable after
the date hereof, Buyer and the Sellers Representative will use good faith
efforts to mutually agree upon an allocation of the Closing Date Purchase
Price and liabilities of the Company among the assets of the Company
(including assets of those Subsidiaries that are treated as disregarded
entities for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) for applicable Tax purposes,
including such modifications as are appropriate to reflect any adjustments in
the Closing Date Purchase Price in accordance with this Agreement (the
"Allocation"). If the Parties are able to reach agreement on the Allocation,
Buyer, the Acquired Companies and Sellers agree to (a) prepare and file each
of their respective Tax Returns and any required amendments thereto, on a
basis consistent with the Allocation as so determined and (b) unless otherwise
required pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code), take no position inconsistent with the Allocation on any applicable Tax
Return or in any proceeding before any Taxing Authority; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent any Party from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority based upon or
arising out of the Allocation, and no Party shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing
Authority challenging the Allocation. If, after good faith efforts, the
Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the Allocation, each of Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall be free to determine its own Allocation
for applicable Tax purposes. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.7.10 | _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,

the terms "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers or
monetary qualifiers to similar effect shall be disregarded.



   7.2 | _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the terms of this
_Article 7_ , Buyer and, after the Closing, the Company, jointly and
severally, will indemnify and hold Sellers and their  
---|--- 
 



\- 46 - directors, shareholders, managers, members, trustees, employees, agents,
Representatives, successors and permitted assigns (each a "Seller Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless against
and in respect of any and all Losses which such Seller Indemnified Party has
suffered, incurred or become subject to arising out of, based upon or
otherwise in respect of: 
---|--- 



     | 7.2.1 | any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in _Article 4_ of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | 7.2.2 | any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or
obligation of Buyer or, after the Closing, the Company, under this Agreement;
and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 7.2.3 | any claim for payment of fees and/or expenses as a broker
or finder in connection with the origin, negotiation or execution of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of
the Transaction based upon any agreement, arrangement or understanding
between the claimant and Buyer or any of its agents or Representatives. 
---|---|--- 
 

For purposes of determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty
or a covenant or agreement has occurred and for purposes of calculating the
amount of Losses to which any Seller Indemnified Party is entitled hereunder,
the terms "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers or
monetary qualifiers to similar effect shall be disregarded. 



   7.3 | _Claims_. 
---|--- 



     | 7.3.1 | _Inter-Party Claims_. In order for a Buyer Indemnified
Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (each, an "Indemnified Party") to be
entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this  _Article 7_ , the
Indemnified Party will notify the other Party or Parties from whom such
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing promptly after
the occurrence of the event giving rise to such Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such claim (an
"Inter-Party Claim"); _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification will not affect the indemnification provided under this
Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party will have been actually
and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure, or the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Party are materially increased as a result of
such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying
Party reasonable access during normal business hours to the books, records and
assets of the Indemnified Party which evidence or support such claim or the
act, omission or occurrence giving rise to such Inter-Party Claim and the
right, upon prior notice during normal business hours, to interview at a
mutually convenient time any employee of the Indemnified Party related to the
act, omission or occurrence giving rise to such Inter-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to any such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute will be resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 47 - _Third Party Claims_. In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim made by any Person (other than by an Indemnified
Party, which claims are addressed in _Section_ __ _ 7.3.1_) against
the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party Claim (which
notice will specify in reasonable detail the events giving rise to such Third
Party Claim) promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification will not affect the indemnification provided under this
Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party will have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure or the
indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim. If a Third Party Claim is made, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof. The
Indemnifying Party may also assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
(subject to the limitations set forth below) with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party reasonably acceptable to and upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in such defense and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Party
will control such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party will be liable for the fees and expenses of one outside counsel and any
local counsel reasonably necessary to defend such Third Party Claim (and not
any fees and expenses allocated to any internal counsel) employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not
assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim (other than during any period in
which the Indemnified Party will have failed to give notice of the Third Party
Claim as provided above), and the fees and expenses of such counsel will
constitute Losses for purposes of this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified
Parties will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with
respect to, settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without
the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to assume control of such defense if the Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control (a) seeks non-
monetary relief, (b) involves criminal liability, (c) in the case that Sellers
are the Indemnifying Party, seeks Losses that will not be fully satisfied by
the Indemnification Escrow Amount (or so much thereof as is then remaining on
deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Amount) or (d) involves a claim that, in
the reasonable and good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend. If
the Indemnifying 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 48 - the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably recommend and that by its terms (i)
obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Losses in
connection with such Third Party Claim and (ii) releases the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates completely in connection with such Third Party Claim. 
---|--- 



   7.4 | _Survival_. The respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement, and the
rights of the Parties to seek indemnification with respect thereto,
will survive the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (a) except in
respect of any claims for indemnification as to which written notice will have
been duly given pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "General Indemnification
Period"), and subject to the other provisions of this _Article 7_ , such
representations and warranties, and the rights of the parties to seek
indemnification with respect thereto, will expire at the end of the General
Indemnification Period, except that the Fundamental Representations and the
representations in  _Section_ __ _ 3.18_ (Tax Matters) (the "Tax
Representations") will survive for the applicable statute of limitations plus
sixty (60) days and (b) except in respect of any claims for indemnification
as to which written notice will have been duly given pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.3_, and subject to the other provisions of this _Article 7_ , such
covenants and agreements will survive the Closing in accordance with their
respective terms until performed by the respective Party. 
---|--- 



   7.5 | _Certain Limitations on Indemnification_. 
---|--- 



     | 7.5.1 | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the amount of Losses (except for Losses based upon actual common
law fraud) that may be recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
any and all claims for indemnification made under _Section_ __ _ 7.1.1_ will
be limited, individually and in the aggregate, to the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, and recovery by the Buyer Indemnified Parties from
the Indemnification Escrow Amount will be the sole and exclusive remedy for
any and all claims for indemnification made under _Section_ __ _ 7.1.1_
(except for Losses based upon actual common law fraud of Sellers). Nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ will be deemed to limit any rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties as against any insurer under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy or against an Indemnifying Party for a claim based
on _Section_ __ _ 7.1.2_ through _Section_ __ _ 7.1.4_. All claims for
indemnification made under this Agreement will first be sought and
satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow Amount. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7.5.2 |

Sellers will have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
against Losses under  _Section_ __ _ 7.1.1_, unless (a) an individual claim
or group of related claims for Losses exceeds an amount equal to $50,000 (a
"Minor Claim"), and (b) the aggregate amount of Losses, excluding all Minor
Claims, is greater than $2,115,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case the Buyer
Indemnified Parties will, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5.1_, be entitled
to indemnification for all Losses in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Deductible and threshold for a Minor Claim will not apply
to Losses based on a breach of a Fundamental Representation  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 49 - fraud of Sellers, for which there will be no minimum threshold before recovery
(or, for avoidance of doubt, any claim for indemnification made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1.2_ through _Section_ __ _ 7.1.4_). 
---|--- 
 



   7.6 | _Certain Other Restrictions on Indemnification_. 
---|--- 



     | 7.6.1 | Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified Party will have any right to
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to any Losses to the extent
(and only to the extent) such Losses (a) constitute liabilities in the
amounts reserved or accrued for (whether in whole or in part) in, the
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value (as finally agreed upon or
determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.4_), (b) arise solely out of
changes after the Closing Date in applicable Law or interpretations or
applications thereof (provided that this clause (b) shall not apply with
respect to any Taxes of a Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), or
(c) are duplicative of Losses that have previously been recovered hereunder
(including, without limitation, under the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy). 
---|---|--- 



     | 7.6.2 | No Buyer Indemnified Party will have any right to assert
any claim against any Indemnifying Party with respect to any Loss, cause of
action or other claim to the extent such Loss is a Loss, cause of action
or claim with respect to which such Buyer Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) with the primary
intent of accelerating the time period in which such matter is asserted or
payable in order to cause a claim to be made prior to the applicable
expiration date set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7.6.3 | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Sellers will have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
any Taxes with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period except to the
extent attributable to a breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Sections 3.18.6_ , _3.18.7_ , _3.18.9_ , _3.18.11_ and _3.18.12_. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 7.6.4 | Buyer and Sellers agree to treat any indemnification
payments received pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Closing Date Purchase Price to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 



   7.7 | _Calculation and Mitigation of Losses_. 
---|--- 



     | 7.7.1 |

The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article 7_ will be net of any amounts recovered by such Indemnified Party
under insurance policies or other collateral sources with respect to such
Losses in excess of the sum of (i) reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and
expenses relating to collection under such policies or other collateral
sources, and (ii) the deductible associated therewith to the extent actually
paid. The Indemnified Parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue such insurance policies or collateral sources (which 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 50 - pursuit (or continued pursuit) to the extent such claim is reasonably
determined by the Indemnified Parties to not be covered and payable under or
by such insurance policies or collateral sources), and in the event the
Indemnified Parties actually receive any recovery, the amount of such recovery
will be applied _first_ , to refund any payments made by the Indemnifying
Parties in respect of indemnification claims pursuant to this _Article 7_
which would not have been so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to
such payment, if any ( _provided_ _that_ if such payments were made out of
the Indemnification Escrow Account and the Indemnification Escrow Account is
still in effect, such amounts will be returned to the Indemnification Escrow
Account), and _second_ , any excess to the Indemnified Parties. If a Buyer
Indemnified Party fails to pursue recoveries under any "occurrence" based
insurance policies or other collateral sources, then Sellers will have the
right of subrogation to pursue such insurance policies or other collateral
sources (to the extent consistent with the terms of such policies) and may
take any reasonable actions necessary to pursue such rights of subrogation in
their name or the name of the party from whom subrogation is obtained. Buyer
will reasonably cooperate, and cause its Representatives and Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) to reasonably
cooperate, with Sellers to pursue any such subrogation claim.  
---|--- 



     | 7.7.2 | Each Partys right to indemnification hereunder will be
subject to its obligations under applicable Law, including under common law,
to mitigate damages. 
---|---|--- 
 



   7.8 | _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties acknowledge, on behalf of
themselves and on behalf of the other Indemnified Parties that, from and after
the Closing, except as provided in _Sections 1.4_  and _10.17_ , their sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement will
be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 7_
(other than claims and causes of action based on actual common law fraud). In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, on behalf of itself
and each of the other Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than rights, claims and causes of action based on actual common law fraud) it
may have against any other Parties arising under or based upon any applicable
Law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article 7_ ), including, but not limited to, its right to
pursue any action or claim other than as expressly stated in this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   7.9 | _Special Rule for Fraud_. Nothing in this _Article 7_ will
operate to limit the common law liability of a Party (the "Liable Party") to
another Party for Losses arising from the fraud of such Liable Party if such
Liable Party is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have committed actual common law fraud against such other Party. 
---|--- 
 



\- 51 - _ARTICLE 8_

 

TERMINATION



   8.1 | _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing Date as follows: 
---|--- 



     | 8.1.1 | by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Sellers
Representative; 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.1.2 | by Buyer if either (a) there has been a material breach of
any representation or warranty of Sellers or the Company contained in _Article
2_ and _Article 3_ , respectively, or (b) Sellers or the Company have
breached or violated any covenant of Sellers or the Company contained in this
Agreement, in each case, where such breach or violation (y) would result in
the failure to satisfy a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and (z) cannot be, or has not been, cured by the date
that is thirty (30) days after Buyer notifies the Sellers Representative in
writing of the breach or violation; _provided_ , that Buyer will not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 8.1.2_ if
Buyer is then in breach of its obligations under this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.1.3 | by the Sellers Representative if either (a) there has
been a material breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in
_Article 4_ of this Agreement or (b) Buyer has breached or violated any
covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement, in each case, where such breach
or violation (y) would result in the failure to satisfy a condition set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and (z) cannot be, or has not
been, cured by the date that is thirty (30) days after the Sellers
Representative notifies Buyer in writing of such breach or violation; 
_provided_ , that Sellers will not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section_ __ _ 8.1.3_ if any Seller is then in breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.1.4 | by Buyer or the Sellers Representative, if (a) the
Closing does not occur on or before April 1, 2018 (the "Termination Date");
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
clause will not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of
this Agreement resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by the
Termination Date or (b) consummation of the Transaction would violate any
non-appealable final order, decree, or judgment of any Governmental Authority
having competent jurisdiction; _provided_ , that the Sellers Representative,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 8.1.4_ if such Partys
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a material
cause of such order, decree, or judgment. 
---|---|--- 



   8.2 | _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. If Buyer or the
Sellers Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to this _Article 8_
, then: (a) written notice thereof will promptly be given to the other
Party(ies), (b) the Transaction will be terminated, (c) the Parties will
cooperate to withdraw, to the extent practicable, all filings, applications,
and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement from the Governmental
Authority, agency or other Person to which made, and (d) this Agreement will
be void and of no further force or effect, other than the provisions of this
_Article 8_ , _Article 9_ , _Article 10_ (other than _Sections 10.5_ and
_10.6_ thereof), and _Exhibit A_ , each of which, along with the
Confidentiality Agreement, will survive any such termination and remain in
full force and effect. Nothing in this _Article 8_ will be deemed (a) to
release any Party from any liability for any material breach by such Party of
this Agreement or fraudulent acts by such Party, the remedies for which will
not be limited by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, (b) to 
---|--- 
 



\- 52 - by the other Party of its obligations under this Agreement or (c) to release
any Party from any of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Financing Sources will have no liability to
the Acquired Companies, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, or
any of their direct or indirect equityholders, hereunder or under the Bridge
Commitment Letters or otherwise relating to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by such agreements; provided, that the foregoing shall not
preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to Buyer under the terms of
the Bridge Commitment Letters (and the related fee letters) or the Financing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Financing
Source shall have liability or obligation (other than to Buyer) for any Losses
suffered or incurred by the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any other
Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement (and the termination
hereof) or the Bridge Commitment Letters, or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (and the abandonment thereof), or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, including any breach of this Agreement or the
Bridge Commitment Letters (including any willful and material breach). 
---|--- 
 



   8.3 | _Return of Confidential Information_. If the Transaction is
terminated, all Confidential Information received by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates will be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 
---|--- 

_ARTICLE 9_

 

SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE



   9.1 | _Sellers_ __ _Representative Appointment and Powers_. The
Sellers Representative (or any successor thereto appointed in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_) will serve as representative of Sellers with full
power and authority to take all actions under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents on behalf of Sellers. Each Seller, by executing this
Agreement, hereby irrevocably confirms, designates and appoints the Sellers
Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for
all purposes of this Agreement and the other Seller Transaction Documents,
including full and exclusive power and authority on such Sellers behalf (a)
to consummate the Transactions, (b) to communicate to, and receive
all communications and notices from Buyer, (c) to execute and deliver on
behalf of such Seller any amendment or waiver of this Agreement or the other
Seller Transaction Documents, (d) to take all other actions to be taken by or
on behalf of such Seller in connection herewith, (e) to direct the payment of
claims from the Adjustment Escrow Amount or Indemnification Escrow Account, as
the case may be, and to incur fees and expenses as determined by the Sellers
Representative, (f) to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and commence, prosecute, defend, participate in, settle,
dismiss or otherwise terminate, as applicable, any Proceeding relating to the
Company, any Seller, this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents
or the Transaction, and to comply with orders of courts and awards of courts,
mediators and arbitrators with respect to such Proceeding and (g) to make,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees,
orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates,
stock powers, letters and other writings, and in general, to do any and all
things and to take any and all actions that the Sellers Representative, in
its sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to carry out the 
---|--- 
 



\- 53 - be deemed the sole authorized agent of Sellers until the agency has
terminated. Each Seller agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers
Representative and will survive the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of any
Seller and will be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal
representatives and successors of each Seller. All actions and decisions of
the Sellers Representative will be binding upon each Seller, and no Seller
will have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest such
actions or decisions, and Buyer will be entitled to rely on such actions.
Neither the Sellers Representative nor any agent employed by it will incur
any liability to any Person relating to the performance of its duties
hereunder except for actions or omissions constituting fraud, bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
---|--- 



   9.2 | _Fees and Expenses_. Any fees, expenses or liabilities incurred
by the Sellers Representative in connection with the performance of its
duties in such capacity under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents will be paid severally by Sellers in proportion to their Pro Rata
Portion. No Seller will seek reimbursement or indemnification for such fees,
expenses or liabilities or otherwise from any of the Company or Buyer. In
addition to any other rights or remedies, the Sellers Representative may,
upon prior or contemporaneous written notice, offset any amounts determined by
it to be owed to the Sellers Representative against any amounts to be paid to
Sellers.  
---|--- 



   9.3 | _Liability of Sellers_ __ _Representative_. Each Seller will,
severally, but not jointly, based on such Sellers Pro Rata Portion, indemnify
and hold harmless, the Sellers Representative from any and all losses,
liabilities and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) arising out of or in connection with the Sellers Representatives
execution and performance (solely in its capacity as the Sellers
Representative and not in its capacity as a Seller) of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, except for fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct by the Sellers Representative. This indemnification
obligation will survive the termination of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. The Sellers Representative may, in all questions
arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel, and for anything
done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Sellers Representative in
accordance with such advice, the Sellers Representative will not be liable to
Sellers or any other Person. In no event will the Sellers Representative
(solely in its capacity as the Sellers Representative and not in its
capacity as a Seller) be liable hereunder or in connection herewith to any
Seller for any indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages. 
---|--- 
 



   9.4 | _Resignation or Removal of the Sellers_ __ _Representative_.
The Sellers Representative may be removed by Sellers at any time upon the
vote of the Persons who were the holders of a majority of the Class A
Membership Interests as of immediately prior to the Closing. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Sellers Representative as provided
below, the Sellers Representative may resign at any time thirty (30) days
after giving notice thereof to Sellers. Upon any such removal or resignation,
Sellers may appoint a successor Sellers Representative by a vote of the
Persons who were the holders of a majority of the Class A Membership
Interests as of immediately prior to the Closing. If no successor Sellers
Representative will have been appointed by Sellers and accepted such
appointment within twenty (20) days after the retiring
Sellers Representatives giving of 
---|--- 
 



\- 54 - Representative, then the retiring or removed Sellers Representative may, on
behalf of Sellers, appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as the Sellers Representative hereunder, such successor Sellers
Representative will thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Sellers
Representative, and the retiring or removed Sellers Representative will be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring or
removed Sellers Representatives resignation or removal, as applicable,
hereunder as the Sellers Representative, this _Article 9_ will continue in
effect for such retiring Sellers Representatives benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the
Sellers Representative. 
---|--- 

_ARTICLE 10_

have that OMM has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or any of its Affiliates (on
the one hand) and Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (on the other
hand), OMM may represent Sellers or such Affiliate in such dispute even though
the interests of Sellers or such Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer or
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and even though OMM may
have represented any Acquired Company in a matter substantially related to
such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer or the Acquired
Companies. Buyer further agrees, and agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) to agree, that, as to
all communications among OMM and Sellers and their respective Affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies) that relate in any
way to the Transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to, and may be
controlled by, Sellers and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies).
Accordingly, none of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) will have access to such communications or to the files of OMM
relating to the Transaction from and after the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a dispute arises between Buyer or its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) and a third party other than a Party to this Agreement
after the Closing, the Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by OMM to such
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquired Companies may not
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Sellers. This
_Section_ __ _ 10.11_ will be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section_ __
_ 10.11_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of OMM.

thereof) or the application of any such provision (or portion thereof) to any
Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced pursuant to any applicable
Law or public policy, all other provisions of this Agreement (or remaining
portion of such provision) will nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that any
provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner, to the end that the Transaction
as originally contemplated is fulfilled to the extent possible.

hereof. There are no warranties, representations, or other agreements between
the Parties hereto, or on which any of them has relied in connection with the

   10.17 | _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or otherwise were breached or violated. Accordingly, each Party agrees that,

cooperate fully in any attempt by the other Parties in obtaining any such
equitable remedy. Each Party further agrees that, in the event of any action
for specific performance in respect of such breach or violation, it will not
assert the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate or that the
consideration reflected in this Agreement was inadequate or that the terms of
this Agreement were not just and reasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
subject to the rights of the parties to the Bridge Commitment Letters under
the terms thereof, none of the Sellers, the Sellers Representative, the
Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates, or their direct and indirect
equityholders, in each case other than Buyer, shall have any rights or claims

their capacity as such in connection with the Financing and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
