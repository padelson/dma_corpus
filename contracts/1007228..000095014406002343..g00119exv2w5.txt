          Section 2.3 Surrender and Payment.

          (a) Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the

for the purpose of exchanging Share Certificates for the Initial Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article II. On the same Business Day as,

transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
Initial Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the

and credit of the United States of

Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall
be payable to the Surviving Corporation. Any losses resulting from the
investment of the Exchange Fund shall not in any way diminish Parent's and
Merger Subsidiary's obligations to pay the full amount of the Initial Merger
Consideration.

          (b) Share Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares: (i) a letter of
transmittal in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and to be
agreed upon prior to the Effective Time, which specifies that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares
(the "Share Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Share
Certificates to the Paying Agent; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Share Certificates in exchange for the Initial Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or
2.2(b), as applicable. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Share Certificate

validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay to the holder of such Share Certificate, in exchange
therefore, the amount of cash in immediately available funds which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Share Certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or 2.2(b), as applicable, and the
Share Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment of the relevant portion of the Initial Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Share Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Share Certificate
representing such Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the relevant portion of the
Initial Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Share Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Share Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender (or at such other applicable time) such portion of the Initial Merger
Consideration and any Additional Merger Consideration to which the holder of
such Share Certificate is entitled pursuant and subject to this Article II. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Share
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

          (c) Company Option Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of Company Options: (i) a letter
of transmittal in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and to
be agreed


                                       10

<PAGE>

upon prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Company Options in exchange for the Initial Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.11(a). Upon
surrender to the Company of a copy of the agreement and/or instrument evidencing
a Company Option (an "Option Certificate"), together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to the holder of
such Company Option, in exchange therefor, subject to Section 2.6, the amount of
cash in immediately available funds which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.11(a). No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Company Options pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.

          (d) Company Warrant Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of Company Warrants: (i) a
letter of transmittal in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company
and to be agreed upon prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of such Company Warrants in exchange for the Initial
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.11(b). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a copy of the agreement and/or
instrument evidencing a Company Warrant (a "Warrant Certificate" and, together
with the Share Certificates and the Company Option Certificates, the
"Certificates"), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay to the holder of such Company Warrant, in exchange
therefor, subject to Section 2.6, the amount of cash in immediately available
funds which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.11(b). No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company
Warrants pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

          (e) No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Shares, Options
or Warrants represented by such Certificates, except the right to receive the
Aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled or as provided
by Law.

          (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares, Options or Warrants one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Shares Options or Warrants who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claim with respect to the Initial Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares, Options or Warrants as of a date which
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

written notice to Parent and each Stakeholder. The decisions and actions of any
such replacement Stakeholder Representative shall be, for all purposes, those of
the Stakeholder Representative as if originally named herein. The Stakeholder
Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted as Stakeholder
Representative, except to the extent that the Stakeholder Representative was
grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct. All fees and expenses,
including for attorneys, accountants, financial and other advisors, paying
agents and other persons and insurance, in each case necessary or appropriate
and engaged by the Stakeholder Representative in the performance of its duties
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Agent's Escrow Agreement
shall be paid from the Agent's Escrow Fund. The Stakeholder Representative shall
be compensated by the Stakeholders for acting in its capacity as Stakeholder
Representative on the terms and conditions set forth in the Agent's Escrow
Agreement.

          (e) The Stakeholders shall, severally but not jointly, indemnify,

demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages, obligations,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs)
arising as a result of or incurred in connection with any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by the Stakeholder Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, except to the extent it is
demonstrated that the Stakeholder Representative was grossly negligent or
engaged in willful misconduct. In addition, each Stakeholder forever voluntarily
releases and discharges the Stakeholder Representative, his or her heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns, from any and all claims, demands,
suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages, obligations, liabilities,
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs), whether known or
unknown, anticipated or unanticipated, arising as a result of or incurred in

Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, except to the extent it can be demonstrated that the Stakeholder
Representative was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct. Expenses
(including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by the Stakeholder
Representative in defending any claim, demand, suit, action or cause of action
may be paid out of the Agent's Escrow Fund in advance of the final disposition
of such claim, demand, suit, action or cause of action upon receipt of an
undertaking by the Stakeholder Representative to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that the Stakeholder Representative is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Stakeholders pursuant to this Section 2.4(e).

          Section 2.5 Adjustments. If, at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Aggregate Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares
of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

          Section 2.6 Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article
II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Tax Law, including any withholding from any payment that is treated as wages or
compensation for the performance of services. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

          Section 2.7 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming the Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct,
and the delivery of an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

          Section 2.8 Determination of Initial Merger Consideration. Not less
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall

Closing Date, together with a statement (the "Company's Statement") of the
Company's estimation of each of the following items of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date for purposes of calculating the Initial
Merger Consideration: (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) the amount of
Indebtedness.


                                       14

          Section 2.9 Post-Closing Adjustment of Initial Merger Consideration.
The Initial Merger Consideration shall be adjusted following the Closing as
provided in this Section 2.9:

          (a) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation, under the supervision of Parent, shall prepare, in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Statement of Adjustment Methods (as
defined below) and otherwise on a basis consistent with the Reference Balance
Sheet and the audited consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, and deliver to the
Stakeholder Representative (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing
Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and (ii) a written determination (the
"Determination") of the amount of Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the
"Preliminary Working Capital Amount"), including the basis for such Closing Date
Balance Sheet and Determination set forth in reasonable detail and all
supporting calculations. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Working
Capital" means the amount of working capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis, calculated in accordance with the definitions,
procedures, methodologies, judgments, assumptions and estimates set forth on
Exhibit D. The term "Target Working Capital Amount" means $8,281,000, such
amount having been calculated using the definitions and procedures set forth in
calculations on Exhibit D.

          (b) Upon receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Determination, the Stakeholder Representative shall have forty-five (45) days
(the "Review Period") to review such Closing Date Balance Sheet and
Determination and related computations of the Preliminary Working Capital
Amount. In connection with the review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Determination, Parent shall give, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its and the Surviving Corporation's Affiliates and Representatives to give, to
the Stakeholder Representative and its Representatives full access to the books,
records and other materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by or for, Parent, the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their respective accountants and Representatives, including,
without limitation, to such historical financial information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries as the Stakeholder Representative or its
Representatives may request, in each case, in order to permit the timely and
complete review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Determination in
accordance with this Section 2.9(b). If the Stakeholder Representative has
accepted such Closing Date Balance Sheet and Determination in writing or has not
given written notice to Parent setting forth any objection of the Stakeholder
Representative to such Closing Date Balance Sheet and Determination (a
"Statement of Objections") prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then
such Determination shall be final and binding upon the parties, and (i) the
Preliminary Working Capital Amount shall be deemed the Working Capital amount of
the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Final Working Capital Amount") and (ii)
the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be deemed the final Closing Date Balance
Sheet of the Company (the "Final Closing Date Balance Sheet"). In the event that
the Stakeholder Representative delivers a Statement of Objections during the
Review Period, Parent and the Stakeholder Representative shall use their
reasonable efforts to agree on the amount of Working Capital of the Company as
of the Closing Date and appropriate adjustments


                                       15

<PAGE>

to the Closing Date Balance Sheet within thirty (30) days following the receipt
by Parent of the Statement of Objections. If the parties are unable to reach an
agreement as to such amounts and adjustments within such thirty (30) day period,
then the matter shall be submitted as promptly as practicable to Ernst & Young
LLP, or if Ernst & Young LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity,
to PricewaterhouseCoopers, or if PricewaterhouseCoopers is unwilling or unable
to serve in such capacity, to such other independent accounting firm agreed to
by the parties (such accountant, the "Settlement Accountant"), who shall resolve
the matters still in dispute and adjust the Determination to reflect such
resolution and establish the Final Working Capital Amount and the Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet; provided, however, that the Settlement Accountant may not
determine (i) an amount of Working Capital in excess of that claimed by the
Stakeholder Representative or less than that claimed by Parent; (ii) an amount
of cash or cash equivalents on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet in excess of
that claimed by the Stakeholder Representative or less than that claimed by
Parent; or (iii) an amount of Indebtedness on the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet in excess of that claimed by Parent or less than that claimed by the
Stakeholder Representative. The Settlement Accountant shall make such
determination within forty-five (45) days following the submission of the matter
to the Settlement Accountant for resolution, and such determination shall be
final and binding upon Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Stakeholder
Representative and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Stakeholder Representative agrees that it will not have any right to, and
will not, institute any Action of any kind challenging such determination or
with respect to the matters that are the subject of this Section 2.9, except
that the foregoing shall not preclude an Action to enforce such determination.

          (c) In the event any dispute is submitted to the Settlement Accountant
for resolution as provided in Section 2.9(b) of this Agreement, the fees,
charges and expenses of the Settlement Accountant shall be paid one-half by
Parent and one-half by the Stakeholders. All fees and disbursements allocated to
the Stakeholders pursuant to this Section 2.9(c) shall be paid out of the
Agent's Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

          (d) In the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is greater than
the Target Working Capital Amount (such excess, the "Excess Working Capital
Amount"), the Initial Merger Consideration shall be increased by, and Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, within five (5) Business Days of the
determination of the Final Working Capital Amount and the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet, into the Agent's Escrow Account (and such payment shall be deemed
part of the Agent's Escrow Fund) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount equal to such Excess Working Capital Amount, together with
interest thereon for the period from (and including) the Closing Date to (but
excluding) the date of payment, at the prime rate as quoted in the Money Rates

          (e) In the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is less than
the Target Working Capital Amount (such deficiency, the "Working Capital
Deficiency"),


                                       16

the Initial Merger Consideration shall be reduced by, and Parent shall be
entitled to payment from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, of an amount equal to such Working Capital Deficiency, together with
interest thereon for the period from (and including) the Closing Date to (but
excluding) the date of payment, at the Applicable Rate.

shall be deemed part of the Agent's Escrow Fund) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to such Excess Cash Amount, together with
interest thereon for the period from (and including) the Closing Date to (but
excluding) the date of payment, at the Applicable Rate.

          (g) In the event that the amount of cash and cash equivalents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date set forth on the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than the amount of cash and cash equivalents
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date set forth on the
Company's Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.8 (such deficiency, the
"Cash Deficiency"), the Initial Merger Consideration shall be reduced by, and
Parent shall be entitled to payment from the Escrow Account in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, of an amount equal to such Cash Deficiency, together with
interest thereon for the period from (and including) the Closing Date to (but
excluding) the date of payment, at the Applicable Rate.

          (h) In the event that the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date set forth on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet is greater than the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date set forth on the Company's Statement
delivered pursuant to Section 2.8 (such excess, the "Excess Indebtedness"), the
Initial Merger Consideration shall be reduced by, and Parent shall be entitled

amount equal to such Excess Indebtedness, together with interest thereon for the
period from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of
payment, at the Applicable Rate.

          (i) In the event that the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date set forth on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet is less than the amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date set forth on the Company's Statement

<PAGE>

be increased by, and Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, within five
(5) Business Days of the determination of the Final Working Capital Amount and
the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, into the Agent's Escrow Account (and such
payment shall be deemed part of the Agent's Escrow Fund) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Indebtedness Deficiency,
together with interest thereon for the period from (and including) the Closing
Date to (but excluding) the date of payment, at the Applicable Rate.

          (j) If any amount is required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.9 and
is paid later than five (5) Business Days following the determination of the
final amounts pursuant to Section 2.9(b), interest at a rate of the Applicable
Rate plus 5% per annum (e.g., if the Applicable Rate is 3.0%, the interest rate
applied to such amount, pursuant to this Section 2.9(j) shall be 8.0% per annum)
shall be added to such amount, for the period from (and including) such fifth
(5th) Business Day following the determination of the final amounts to (but
excluding) the date of payment.

          (k) In acting under this Agreement, the Settlement Accountant shall be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

          Section 2.10 Dissenting Shares.

such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares" and each holder of Dissenting Shares, a "Dissenting
Stockholder") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, a
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration. Such Dissenting Stockholders
shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held

except that all Dissenting Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          Except as set forth in the written disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent and Merger Subsidiary in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), it being
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary that any matter set
forth in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to be a disclosure for all purposes of this Agreement and all other
sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter to which such matter
could reasonably be expected to be pertinent, but shall expressly not be deemed
to constitute an admission by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
otherwise imply, that any such matter rises to the level of a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or is otherwise material for purposes of this Agreement or
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary as follows:

          Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Charter Documents.

          (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and has the requisite corporate power and corporate authority and
any necessary Company Permit to own, operate and lease the properties that it
purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is being
conducted as of the date of this Agreement, except for such failures to be in
good standing or to have corporate power, corporate authority or a Company
Permit that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to


                                       20

<PAGE>

have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensure necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a complete list of the Company's Subsidiaries, together with
the jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary, as of the date of this
Agreement.

          (b) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement complete and correct copies of (i) the certificate of
incorporation of the Company (including any certificates of designation), as
amended and currently in effect and the bylaws of the Company, as amended and
currently in effect (collectively, the "Company Organizational Documents"), and
(ii) the articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, as amended and currently
in effect (collectively, the "Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents").

          Section 3.2 Corporate Authorization; Enforceability; Board and
Stockholder Action.

          (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and, subject to the satisfaction or, if permitted,
waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that such enforcement may be subject to (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii)
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in
a proceeding at law or in equity). Each Ancillary Agreement when executed and
delivered, will be duly executed and delivered by the Stakeholder Representative
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of each Ancillary
Agreement by each party thereto other than the Stakeholder Representative, will
constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Stakeholder Representative
enforceable against the Stakeholder Representative in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent that such enforcement may be subject to (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
principles


                                       21

<PAGE>

of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity).

          (b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called
and held, unanimously has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger), and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders vote for
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger). Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Company Stockholders have executed and delivered written
consents in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL which contain the Requisite
Stockholder Approvals.

          Section 3.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

          (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, (i) the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the similar organizational documents
of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred
to in Section 3.3(b) below, any Material Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or any of their respective properties or other
assets is subject or (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 3.3(b) below, any Law applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such
conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to (A) have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or (B) prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) require no action by or filing with, any
Governmental Authority other than (i) the filing of a certificate of merger in
connection with the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, (ii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (iii) those set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and (iv) such other filings, consents and/or approvals
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          Section 3.4 Capitalization.

          (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i)
55,000,000 shares of Common Stock and (ii) 15,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,

Letter or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely

          (f) From and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options and
Company Warrants shall cease to have any rights to receive Shares upon exercise
of such Company Option or Company Warrants and shall only have the right to
receive the Aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled or
as provided by Law.

          (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company is not a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or
plan that has resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the

extensions have been timely filed and any such extension shall have been granted
and shall not have expired, and all such filed Tax Returns are true, complete
and accurate except to the extent any failure to file or any inaccuracies in

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All Taxes due and owing by
the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company (whether or not shown on any Tax
Return) have been paid, or adequately reserved for, except to the extent any
failure to pay or reserve would not reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There is no Tax
Claim in writing with respect to any Taxes due and owing by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, which, if determined adversely, would reasonably be
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with all
rules and regulations relating to the withholding of Taxes and have withheld and
paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any
amount paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an
affiliated group (or similar state, local or foreign filing group) filing a

to, or any extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax, in either case,
that is still outstanding. There are no Liens relating to Taxes upon the assets
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company other than Liens relating to
current Taxes not yet due and payable.

jurisdiction. No power of attorney has been granted with respect to any matter
relating to Taxes that could affect the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company

Code by reason of a change in accounting method initiated by the Company or such
Subsidiary, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such adjustment or
change in accounting method.

          (e) The Company has made available to Parent copies of all income Tax
Returns of Company and each of its Subsidiaries for the taxable years ended

          (f) The Company will not be required to include any item of income in,
or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i) change in
method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law)
executed on or prior to the Closing Date; or (iii) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date.

to any person that is not a member of the affiliated group of corporations of
which the Company is the common parent qualifying for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement

<PAGE>

               (v) all Contracts evidencing Indebtedness;

               (vi) all Contracts under which any Person has directly or

     Company or any Subsidiary, or the Company or any Subsidiary has directly or
     indirectly guaranteed the indebtedness, liabilities or obligations of any

accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforcement may be
subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights

or any Subsidiary under any Material Contract or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any other party to any Material Contract, except for breaches that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a

delivery of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"), it being
acknowledged and agreed by the Company that any matter set forth in any section
or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be a disclosure
for all purposes of this Agreement and all other sections or subsections of the
Parent Disclosure Letter to which such matter could reasonably be expected to be
pertinent, but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise imply, that any such matter
rises to the level of a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or is otherwise
material for purposes of this Agreement or the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company
as follows:

          Section 4.1 Organization and Qualification; Charter Documents.

operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is being conducted as of the
date of this Agreement, except for such failures to be in good standing or to
have corporate power, corporate authority or a Parent Permit that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Material


                                       34

<PAGE>

Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary is duly qualified
or licensed to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensure necessary, except for such

Effect on Parent.

Letter, the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance

into any agreement by its terms requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger. The Company will not (and will cause its
Subsidiaries not to and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their Representatives not to) provide any information concerning the Company to
any other Person who the Company reasonably believes will utilize such
information to make or consider making an Acquisition Proposal, and will
promptly notify (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) Parent in
writing upon receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives acting on its
behalf) of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall indicate the identity of
the offeror and the principal terms and conditions of any such proposal, inquiry
or contact. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
Company's and such Subsidiaries' respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and terminate any existing solicitation, activity, substantive discussion
or negotiation with any Person heretofore conducted by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal.

          Section 5.5 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts.

          (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make


                                       41

effective, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the End Date,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary approvals
under any applicable Laws required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations
from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities) and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations from Third Parties and
(iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and fully to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall, except
to the extent as would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
either the Company or Parent, agree or commit to any and all divestitures,
licenses or hold separate or similar arrangements with respect to its
businesses, properties or assets and agree or commit to any restrictions or
limitations on the conduct of its businesses, in each case as a condition to
obtaining any and all approvals from any Governmental Authority for any reason
in order to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than the End Date, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including taking any and all actions necessary in order to
ensure that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent, approval or
authorization of the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("Antitrust
Division"), any authority enforcing applicable Law, any State Attorney General
or any other Governmental Authority, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction,
temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding and (z)
no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition Law or relating to any
applicable Laws, would preclude consummation of the Merger by the End Date. The
Company shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Parent in writing to divest,
hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect to the
businesses, services, or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
furtherance of this Section 5.5; provided, however, that any such action may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
herein provided and subject to the parties' obligations under applicable Law,
none of the parties hereto shall knowingly take or cause to be taken any action
that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
satisfaction by the End Date of the condition set forth in Section 6.1(d). Each
of Parent and the Company undertakes and agrees to file as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement, a
Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division and to make as soon as practicable such filings and apply as soon as
practicable for such approvals and consents as are required under any other
applicable Laws. Parent and Company shall seek early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act.

          (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries and requests received from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division,


                                       42

<PAGE>

any State Attorney General or other Governmental Authority in connection with
antitrust matters or applicable Laws and (ii) not extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust
Division, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Authority not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

          (c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, if any
anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties and its Board of
Directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to grant or secure
any required approvals or consents and take all such actions as are reasonable
and legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable upon and subject to the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
(including any resulting delays) of any such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

          (d) In addition, each party shall, subject to applicable Law (i)
promptly notify the other party of any written communication to that party from
the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other
Governmental Authority, including insurance, health or other regulatory
authorities, and, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
communication to any of the foregoing, (ii) consult with the other party prior
to participating in any meeting, telephone call or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger and provide the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in any such meeting, telephone call or
discussion, and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and written communications (or a reasonably detailed summary of any
oral communications) between them and their respective representatives on the
one hand, and any Governmental Authority, including insurance, health or other
regulatory authorities, or members of their respective staffs on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.

          Section 5.6 Employee Benefits.

          (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms (without giving
effect to any amendments thereto after the Effective Time except if consented to
by the affected party), all benefits and obligations under the employment and
severance agreements listed in Section 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Company's Severance Benefit Plan (such agreements and plan,
collectively, the "Severance Agreements"). Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company agree that the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "change in
control," "change of control" or "triggering event" or similar transaction for
purposes of the Severance Agreements, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in any such agreements or plan.


                                       43

<PAGE>

          (b) For the one year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Company Employees") with
(i) base salaries equal to or greater than the base salaries of such Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) health and welfare
benefits that, with respect to each class of similarly situated employees, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the health and welfare benefits
provided to such classes of employees under the Company Employee Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

          (c) Notwithstanding the generality of the covenant set forth in
Section 5.6(b), Parent shall provide each Company Employee who is terminated by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation during the one-year period following the
Effective Time with severance payments and severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the greater of the severance payments and severance benefits (i)
to which such employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination
under the severance policies of the Company as set forth in Section 5.6(c) of
the Company Disclosure Letter or (ii) provided by the severance policy
maintained by Parent for similarly situated employees; provided that nothing in
this Section 5.6(c) shall modify or limit the provisions of the Severance
Agreements.

          (d) Parent will or, to the extent a plan is insured, will cause the
insurance carrier to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of benefits (including, for purposes of
vacation and severance) under any benefit plans maintained by Parent for such
Company Employees' service with the Company and its Subsidiaries to the same
extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In the event that Parent chooses to terminate any
Company Employee Plans and substitute any benefit plans maintained by Parent
that provide substantially comparable health and welfare benefits to such
Company Employee Plans and that otherwise are in compliance with this Section
5.6, such substitution shall be in lieu of Parent's obligations pursuant to
Section 5.6(b)(ii) above.

          (e) Parent will, or to the extent a plan is insured, will cause the
insurance carrier to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise
applicable to Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan
that provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be eligible to
participate following the Closing to the extent such conditions are covered
under the analogous Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employees
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) honor any deductible,
co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company Employees and
their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the calendar year
prior to the Effective Time and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective
Time, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company
Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time.

          Section 5.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release issued by
either Parent or the Company with respect to the Merger shall be agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent feasible, consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system.

          Section 5.8 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, as the case may be, any documents or instruments, and to take any
other actions and do any other things, in the name and on behalf of the Company
or Merger Subsidiary, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record
or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired
or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger and to otherwise accomplish the purpose and intent of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

          Section 5.9 Updates to Disclosure Letters. From the date hereof
through the Closing, the Company shall give written notice to Parent of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, after the date hereof, of any event which
occurrence or failure has caused or would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any section of the
Company Disclosure Letter to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect. In
such event, (i) unless such event would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate with the events described in other written
notices previously received by Parent, a Material Adverse Effect, such written
notice shall be deemed to have amended the applicable Disclosure Letter and to
have qualified the representations and warranties contained in Article III for
the purposes of determining whether the condition specified in Section 6.3(a)
has been satisfied, but (ii) such written notice shall not be deemed to have
amended any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or modified any
representation or warranty for purposes of determining the Parent's right to
make a claim on the Escrow Fund pursuant to Article VII.

          Section 5.10 Indemnification; D&O Insurance.

          (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") from and
against all losses, claims, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees and expenses), liabilities, judgments and settlement amounts that are paid
or incurred in connection with any pending, threatened or completed claim,
action, suit, formal or informal proceeding, formal or informal investigation or
formal or informal inquiry (whether civil, criminal,


                                       45

<PAGE>

administrative or investigative and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time), that is (i) based on, or arises out of, the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time or (ii) based on, or
arising out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case under clause (i) or (ii) above, to the fullest extent a
corporation is permitted under applicable Law to indemnify its own directors or
officers, as the case may be. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or inquiry is brought
against any Indemnified Party (whether prior to or after the Effective Time),
(i) the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to participate therein, and to
the extent it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with legal counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and, after notice from the
Surviving Corporation to such Indemnified Party of Surviving Corporation's
election to assume the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Party under this provision for any legal expenses of
other counsel or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party,
(ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any
claim effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not enter into any settlement of any claim unless such
settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against
such Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party wishing to obtain indemnification
under this Section 5.10(a), shall, within ten (10) Business Days of learning of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, notify Parent
thereof; provided, however, the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such
notice shall not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party under this Section
5.10 except to the extent that the rights of the Surviving Corporation or Parent
are materially prejudiced thereby). In the event the Surviving Corporation does
not assume the defense of an action in accordance with this Section 5.10(a), (i)
the Indemnified Party shall assume the defense thereof with legal counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation at the cost and expense of
the Surviving Corporation; (ii) the Indemnified Parties as a group seeking
indemnification with respect to the same or a substantially related matter may
retain only one law firm with respect to such matter except to the extent that
under applicable standards of professional conduct, such counsel would have a
conflict representing such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Party or
Indemnified Parties, (iii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
all reasonable expenses of the disposition of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry to each Indemnified Party to the full
extent permitted by applicable Law promptly after statements therefor are
received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, in either case to the
extent not prohibited by the DGCL, (iv) Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties and all costs and expenses of the Indemnified Parties in
connection with seeking and obtaining indemnification from the Surviving
Corporation, from time to time, in each case within twenty (20) Business Days of
the receipt by Parent of a statement from such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties and (v) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use reasonable
best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. In the event of any
dispute as to whether an Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the standards
set


                                       46

<PAGE>

forth under applicable Law and as applicable, the Company Organizational
Documents and the Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents, a determination
shall be made by independent counsel reasonably acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
extent that any Indemnified Party is, by reason of the fact that such
Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, a witness in any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry to which such Indemnified Party is not a party, such Indemnified Party
shall be indemnified and held harmless against all costs and expenses in
connection therewith.

          (b) Parent's obligations under Section 5.6(a) shall survive until the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, provided, that, Parent's
obligations pursuant to Section 5.6(a) shall survive such sixth (6th)
anniversary, and Parent shall continue to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party, in accordance with this Section 5.10 with respect to any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or inquiry of which such
Indemnified Party shall have delivered notice to Parent pursuant to Section
5.6(a) prior to the (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as
such claim is finally resolved (such matter that is not so resolved until after
such sixth (6th) anniversary, an "Extended Claim").

          (c) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time (or, with respect to an Extended Claim,
until the date of final resolution of such matters), neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall take any action so as to amend, modify, limit or
repeal the provisions for indemnification of Indemnified Parties contained in
the certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or other comparable
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(which as of the Effective Time shall be no less favorable to such individuals
than those maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof) in
such a manner as would adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to
be indemnified by such corporations in respect of their serving in such
capacities prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall honor
all of its indemnification obligations existing as of the Effective Time.

          (d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (the "D&O Policies");
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous in any material respect to
the Indemnified Parties) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts
or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance
to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the
date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 300% amount, the "Maximum
Premium"). If such insurance coverage can only be obtained at an annual premium
in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall obtain and maintain one or more
policies with the greatest coverage available for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent


                                       47

<PAGE>

or the Surviving Corporation may, at Parent's option, purchase, six-year "tail"
prepaid policies on the D&O Policies on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties in any material respect to the
Indemnified Parties than the D&O Policies (such "tail" policies to continue to
provide coverage for any Extended Claim following the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time until final resolution of such Extended Claim). In the event
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation purchases such a "tail" policy, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in
lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this Section 5.10(d) for so long as such "tail" policy shall
be maintained in full force and effect.

          (e) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each party entitled
to insurance coverage under Section 5.10(d), respectively, and his or her heirs
and legal representatives, and shall be in addition to, and shall not impair,
any other rights an Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational
Documents or the Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents, as applicable, or
the comparable organization documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, under applicable Law or otherwise. Parent shall ensure that the
Surviving Corporation complies with all of its obligations under this Section
5.10.

          (f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.10. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies
without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10).

          Section 5.11 Undertakings of Parent. Parent shall perform, or cause to
be performed, when due all obligations of Merger Subsidiary under this
Agreement.

          Section 5.12 Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as among Parent, the Company and the Stakeholder
Representative for certain Tax matters:

          (a) Claims Against Escrow Fund. For a period of twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to make a written claim
against the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement
for, without duplication: (i) Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company or any
Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent such Taxes have
been accrued or reflected in


                                       48

<PAGE>

the Final Working Capital Amount; (ii) Taxes imposed on the Company or any
Subsidiary as a result of the Company or any Subsidiary being included in an
Affiliated Group that files consolidated or combined returns by reason of U.S.
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provision of state, local
or foreign law, except to the extent such Taxes have been accrued or reflected
in the Final Working Capital Amount; (iii) with respect to Straddle Periods,
Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company or any Subsidiary which are allocable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent such Taxes have been accrued
or reflected in the Final Working Capital Amount; and (iv) Taxes imposed on or
payable by the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.11 or this Section 5.12. Any
such claim against the Escrow Fund shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax
Benefit (as defined in Section 7.3(c)) realized with respect to such Taxes for
which a claim against the Escrow Fund is being sought. In no event shall any
matter, facts or circumstances pertaining to any item (or the amount thereof)
set forth on or reflected in the Company's Statement, the Closing Balance Sheet,
the Determination, the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Working
Capital Amount or the Final Working Capital Amount which resulted in a
post-closing adjustment to the Initial Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.9 hereof give rise to any claim by Parent on the Escrow Fund under this
Section 5.12 or Article VII.

          (b) Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods.

               (i) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
     cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
     Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due (including extensions) after the
     Closing Date and for any Straddle Period. Except as otherwise required by
     applicable Law, Parent shall treat items on such Tax Returns in a manner
     consistent with the prior practices and positions of the Company or the
     relevant Subsidiary. Parent shall submit such Tax Returns to the
     Stakeholder Representative for approval, which approval shall not be
     unreasonably withheld, at least thirty (30) days prior to their filing.
     Parent shall receive a disbursement from the Escrow Fund, at least five (5)
     Business Days before the due date of the applicable Tax Return, in an
     amount equal to the Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Return to
     the extent such Taxes are due with respect to the Tax liability of the
     Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the
     portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing date; provided,
     however, Parent shall not receive any disbursement for such Taxes to the
     extent they have been accrued or reflected in the Final Working Capital
     Amount.

               (ii) In the case of any Straddle Period, (A) Property Taxes shall
     be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
     Period on a daily pro-rata basis, and (B) all Taxes other than Property
     Taxes shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
     Post-Closing Tax Period on a closing of the books basis; provided, however,
     that any transaction occurring on the Closing Date or after the Closing
     that is not in the ordinary course of business, including a deemed asset
     sale under Section 338 of the Code, shall be deemed to occur in the
     Post-Closing Tax Period.


                                       49

<PAGE>

          (c) Post-Closing Taxes. Parent shall be responsible for all Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to Post-Closing Tax Periods (including
any Taxes relating to the post-closing portion of any Straddle Period).

          (d) Post-Closing Actions. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (i) shall file, nor allow to be
filed, any amended Tax Return of Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and (ii) shall carry back for federal, state, local or foreign tax
purposes to any taxable period, or portion thereof, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date any operating losses, net
operating losses, capital losses, tax credits or similar items arising in,
resulting from, or generated in connection with a taxable year of the Parent or
any affiliate, or portion thereof, ending after the Closing Date.

          (e) Tax Contests. After the Closing Date, Parent shall notify the
Stakeholder Representative in writing within thirty (30) days of the
commencement of any Tax Claim, of or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of
time would be grounds for a claim against the Escrow Fund under Article VII.
Such notice shall contain factual information describing any asserted Tax Claim
in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any Taxing Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax Claim.
Thereafter, Parent shall deliver to the Stakeholder Representative, as promptly
as possible but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Parent's
receipt thereof, copies of all relevant notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Parent. In the case of any Tax Claim relating to any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date, that, if determined adversely to
the taxpayer or after the lapse of time would be grounds for a claim against the
Escrow Fund under Article VII, the Stakeholder Representative shall have the
right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the right to
settle such Tax Claim without the consent of any other party; provided, however,
that any settlement would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and
the portion of any Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date. In the case of
any Tax Claim relating to the Taxes of any Straddle Period, Parent and
Stakeholder Representative may each participate in the audit or proceeding at
their own expense, and the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by the Parent
or the Stakeholder, whichever would bear the burden of the greatest portion of
the adjustment; provided, however, that the party controlling the Straddle
Period Tax Claim shall not settle such audit or proceeding without the consent
of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the
case of any Tax Claim relating to the Taxes of any Post-Closing Period, Parent
shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the
right to settle such Tax Claim without the consent of any other party; provided,
however, that any settlement would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Period pursuant to which Parent
is entitled to make a claim on the Escrow Fund under Section 5.12(a).

          (f) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund or overpayment (including any interest
in respect thereof) relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, except for any such Tax refunds
reflected or


                                       50

<PAGE>

accrued as a receivable in the Final Working Capital Amount, shall be for the
account of Stakeholder Representative; provided, however, that any such Tax
refund would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the amount of any Tax liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending after the
Closing Date. Any such Tax refund, if received by the Parent or its Affiliates,
shall be payable to Stakeholder Representative within fifteen (15) business days
of the Parent's receipt.

          (g) Cooperation. Parent, the Company, the Subsidiaries and the
Stakeholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, examination, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each of Parent, the Company and
the Stakeholder Representative agrees, upon request, to use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereunder).

          (h) Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between
Parent on the one hand and the Company or the Stakeholder Representative on the
other hand arising out of or relating to the provisions of this Agreement that
relates to Taxes (including the determination of the Tax Benefit) that cannot be
resolved by negotiations between Parent and the Stakeholder Representative
within ninety (90) days of receipt by a party of written notice of such dispute
("Tax Dispute Notice") shall be submitted to a senior tax partner in a mutually
agreeable nationally recognized accounting firm for resolution ("Tax
Arbitrator"). If Parent and the Stakeholder Representative cannot agree on an
accounting firm within one hundred (100) days of receipt by a party of a Tax
Dispute Notice, then the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") shall appoint
the Tax Arbitrator. The resolution reached by the Tax Arbitrator shall be
binding on the Company, the Stakeholder Representative, the Parent and their
respective affiliates, and may be entered and enforced in any court having
jurisdiction. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Stakeholder Representative agrees that it will not have any
right to, and will not, institute any other Action of any kind challenging such
resolution or with respect to the matters that are the subject of this Section
5.12, except that the foregoing shall not preclude an Action to enforce such
resolution. The expenses of the accounting firm shall be born equally by the
Stakeholder Representative and the Parent.

          Section 5.13 Parent Financing. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and
agree that Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's obligations hereunder are not
conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon Parent or Merger Subsidiary obtaining
the Funds to satisfy the Funding Obligations. Parent shall obtain the Funds, and
be in a position to immediately


                                       51

<PAGE>

satisfy the Funding Obligations, in each case as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any event on or prior to the Financing Deadline. Parent shall
keep the Company apprised of all material developments or changes relating to
the Financing Agreements and the financing contemplated thereby. In the event
that the Financing Agreements terminate or the lenders parties thereto shall
advise Parent that they will not or may not be able to provide the financing
contemplated thereby, then Parent shall promptly notify the Company and obtain
replacement financing arrangements as soon as reasonably practicable to obtain
the Funds and satisfy the Funding Obligations.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

          Section 6.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the
Merger. The respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger is subject
to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

          (a) Ancillary Agreements. Each of the Ancillary Agreements shall have
been executed and delivered by each party thereto.

          (b) Antitrust. The waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or any other applicable competition,
merger control, antitrust or similar Law shall have been terminated or shall
have expired.

          (c) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment, order or decree issued by
any court of competent jurisdiction or other statute or Law (collectively,
"Restraints") shall be in effect preventing the consummation of the Merger;
provided, however, that prior to asserting this condition, each of the parties
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of any such
injunction or other order and to appeal as promptly as possible any such
injunction or other order that may be entered.

          Section 6.2 Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary.
The obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to effect the Merger are further
subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the
following conditions:

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement (other than Section 3.10(f) as to
which no representation or warranty is being made for purposes of this Article
VI) shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (without regard to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein), except (i) to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date,
in which case only as of such earlier date and (ii) where the failure of the
representations and warranties to be true and correct individually or in the
aggregate, has not had a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Parent shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the chief
executive officer or chief financial officer of the Company to such effect.


                                       52

<PAGE>

          (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive
officer or chief financial officer of the Company to such effect.

          (c) No Litigation. There shall not be pending any suit or formal
proceeding by any Governmental Authority (i) challenging the acquisition by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any Shares, Options or Warrants, seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger, seeking to place
limitations on the ownership of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation) by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of
any portion of any business or of any assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or Parent and its Subsidiaries and (iii) seeking to obtain from the Company,
Parent or Merger Subsidiary any damages with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger), which in the case of clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) above would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on either the Company or Parent.

          (d) Restraint. No Restraint that would result, directly or indirectly,
in any of the effects referred to in Section 6.2(c) shall be in effect.

          (e) No Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter, since September 30, 2005, there shall not have occurred and
be continuing a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (f) Dissenting Shares. Dissenting Stockholders holding Shares
otherwise exchangeable for no more than seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the
Initial Merger Consideration shall have demanded or perfected the right to an
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

          (g) Legal Opinion. Parent shall have received an opinion of counsel to
the Company, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect of the matters set
forth in Exhibit E attached hereto.

          Section 6.3 Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The obligation of
the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the satisfaction or
waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary contained in this Agreement shall be
true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as
though made on the Closing Date (without regard to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein), except (i) to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which
case only as of such earlier date and (ii) where the failure of the
representations and warranties to be true and correct individually or in


                                       53

<PAGE>

the aggregate, has not had a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The Company
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary to such effect.

          (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary. Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall have each performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to
the Closing Date. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary by the chief executive officer or chief
financial officer of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to such effect.

          Section 6.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company,
Parent or Merger Subsidiary may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the
Merger or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure
of any condition set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, to
be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's breach of any provision
of this Agreement or failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
required by and subject to Section 5.5.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                              CLAIMS ON ESCROW FUND

          Section 7.1 Claims Against Escrow Fund. From and after the Closing
Date and subject to the provisions of this Article VII, Parent shall be entitled
to make a written claim against the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement for, without duplication:

          (a) subject to the limitations in Section 7.3, liabilities, demands,
claims, suits, actions, or causes of action and out-of-pocket costs, expenses,
losses, damages and judgments, whether or not resulting from third party claims,
(including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and accountants)
(collectively, "Damages") arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy or breach
as of the Effective Time of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in Article III (except to the extent such representations and
warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case only any
inaccuracy or breach as of such earlier date);

          (b) Damages arising out of or relating to any non-compliance with or
breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement;

          (c) Damages arising out of the inquiry of the United States Attorney's
Office for the Northern District of Illinois described in paragraph 2 of Section
3.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter, to the extent such Damages relate to such
inquiry described therein and to the extent such Damages arise out of acts or
omissions of the Company, its officers, directors or employees prior to the
Closing Date; and


                                       54

<PAGE>

          (d) Damages arising out of the matters set forth in paragraphs 6 and 7
of Section 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims against the Escrow Fund for any inaccuracy
or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
set forth in Section 3.11 or 5.12 shall be governed exclusively by Section 5.12
of this Agreement.

          Section 7.2 Notice of Loss; Claims Process. Subject to Section 5.12
(with respect to Tax Claims), all claims by Parent under this Article VII shall
be asserted and resolved as follows:

          (a) In the event that (i) any Action is asserted or instituted by any
Person (other than the parties to this Agreement or their Affiliates) which
could give rise to Damages for which Parent may have a claim against the Escrow
Fund under this Agreement (such Action, together with the matters set forth in
Section 7.1(d), but excluding the matter set forth in Section 7.1(c) (which
shall be subject to Section 7.2(d) hereof), a "Third Party Claim") or (ii)
Parent shall be entitled to make a claim for Damages pursuant to Section 7.1
which does not involve a Third Party Claim (such claim, a "Direct Claim" and,
together with Third Party Claims, "Claims"), Parent shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after it becomes aware of a Third Party Claim, or facts supporting
a Direct Claim, send to the Stakeholder Representative and the Escrow Agent a
written notice specifying the nature of such Action and the amount or estimated
amount thereof (which amount or estimated amount shall not be conclusive of the
final amount, if any, of such Action) (a "Claim Notice") together with copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) served on or received by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their Subsidiaries in the
case of a Third Party Claim; provided that a delay in notifying the Stakeholder
Representative and the Escrow Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the rights
of Parent under this Article VII except to the extent that the Stakeholder
Representative shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure to give
such notice, in which case such failure shall constitute a waiver of the rights
of Parent under this Article VII to the extent of such material prejudice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby agree that no Claim Notice is
required with respect to the matter set forth in paragraph 6 of Section 3.8(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter and the parties shall have their respective
rights, obligations, remedies pursuant to this Article VII with respect to such
matter as if such Claim Notice had been timely made.

          (b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Stakeholder
Representative shall have the right, upon written notice to Parent, to
investigate, contest, defend or settle any Third Party Claim that may result in
Damages with respect to which Parent is entitled to make a claim on the Escrow
Fund pursuant to this Article VII and select legal counsel of its choosing in
connection therewith; provided that Parent may, at its option and at its own
expense, participate in the investigation, contesting, defense or settlement of
any such Third Party Claim through Representatives and legal counsel of its own
choosing; and, provided, further, that Stakeholder Representative shall not
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim unless (i) the terms of such
settlement or compromise call only for a payment to Parent out of the Escrow
Fund or (ii) Parent shall have consented in writing to


                                       55

<PAGE>

the terms of such settlement, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
delayed or conditioned. If requested by the Stakeholder Representative, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate with the Stakeholder Representative
and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim or, if appropriate and
related to the Third Party Claim in question, in making any reasonable
counterclaim against the Person making such Third Party Claim, or any cross
complaint against any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates) or similar
action. If the Stakeholder Representative shall not have elected to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of
the Claim Notice, Parent shall have the right, at its option and at the expense
of the Escrow Fund, to do so in such manner as it deems appropriate; provided,
however, the Stakeholder Representative shall have the right to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim at any time thereafter; and provided, further,
that Parent shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim for which it
seeks to make a claim on the Escrow Fund hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Stakeholder Representative, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the event Parent, the Company or its or
their Subsidiaries settles or compromises or consents to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Stakeholder Representative, which failure to obtain consent was not the
result of the Stakeholder Representative unreasonably withholding, delaying or
conditioning such consent, Parent shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived all
rights to make a claim against the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and pursuant to Section 7.3(d)(iv) with respect to such
Third Party Claim. The Stakeholder Representative shall be entitled to
participate in (but not to control) the defense of any Third Party Claim which
it has not elected to defend with its own counsel and at the expense of the
Agent's Escrow Fund.

          (c) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Stakeholder Representative
shall notify Parent and the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days of receipt of a
Claim Notice whether or not the Stakeholder Representative disputes such claim.

          (d) In the event that (i) any Action is asserted or instituted by the
United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois which
could give rise to Damages for which Parent may have a claim against the Escrow
Fund under this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) (such Action, a "Specified
Claim"), Parent shall, within ten (10) Business Days after it becomes aware of a
Specified Claim, send to the Stakeholder Representative and the Escrow Agent a
written notice specifying the nature of such Action and the amount or estimated
amount thereof (which amount or estimated amount shall not be conclusive of the
final amount, if any, of such Action) (a "Specified Claim Notice") together with
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) served on or
received by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their
Subsidiaries; provided that a delay in notifying the Stakeholder Representative
and the Escrow Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the rights of Parent under
this Article VII except to the extent that the Stakeholder Representative shall
have been materially prejudiced by such failure to give such notice, in which
case such failure shall constitute a waiver of the rights of Parent under this
Article VII to the extent of such material prejudice.


                                       56
<PAGE>

          (e) In the event Parent shall deliver a Specified Claim Notice, the
Stakeholder Representative shall have the right, upon written notice to Parent,
to jointly with Parent and the Surviving Corporation, investigate, contest,
defend and settle any Specified Claim that may result in Damages with respect to
which Parent or Merger Sub is entitled to make a claim on the Escrow Fund
pursuant to this Article VII or pursuant to Section 7.3(d)(iv) and jointly
select legal counsel in connection therewith reasonably acceptable to Parent and
the Stakeholder Representative. Neither Parent nor the Stakeholder
Representative shall settle or compromise any Specified Claim without the prior
written consent of the other party, provided that the Stakeholder Representative
shall be permitted to settle any Specified Claim without the prior consent of
Parent if the terms of such settlement or compromise call only for a payment to
Parent out of the Escrow Fund and do not require the payment of any amounts by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(c)(vii). If requested by the other party, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Stakeholder
Representative, on the other hand, will cooperate with one another and their
jointly selected counsel in contesting any Specified Claim or, if appropriate
and related to the Specified Claim in question, in making any reasonable
counterclaim against the Person making such Specified Claim, or any cross
complaint against any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates) or similar
action. If the Stakeholder Representative shall not have elected to assume the
joint investigation, contest and defense of such Specified Claim within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of the Specified Claim Notice, Parent shall have the
right, at its option and at the expense of the Escrow Fund, to do so in such
manner as it deems appropriate; provided, however, the Stakeholder
Representative shall have the right to assume the joint investigation, contest
and defense of such Specified Claim at any time thereafter; and provided,
further, that neither Parent, the Company or its or their Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, or the Stakeholder Respresentative, on the other hand, shall settle or
compromise any Specified Claim without the prior written consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the
event Parent, the Company or its or their Subsidiaries settles or compromises or
consents to the entry of any judgment with respect to any Specified Claim
without the prior written consent of the Stakeholder Representative, which
failure to obtain consent was not the result of the Stakeholder Representative
unreasonably withholding, delaying or conditioning such consent, Parent shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived all rights to make a claim against the Escrow
Fund pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or pursuant to Section
7.3(d)(iv) with respect to such Specified Claim.

          (f) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice or a Specified Claim
Notice under this Agreement, at the reasonable request of the Stakeholder
Representative, Parent, the Company and its and their Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives shall grant the Stakeholder Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access to the books, records and properties of
Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries and their Representatives to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the Claim Notice or the
Specified Claim Notice relates. All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under conditions designed to minimize the
disruption to the businesses of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries and
their Representatives, as the case may be. The Stakeholder Representative will
not, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, use (except in


                                       57

<PAGE>

connection with such Claim Notice or Specified Claim Notice) or disclose to any
third person other than the Stakeholder's Representative (except as may be
required by applicable Law) any confidential information obtained pursuant to
this Section 7.2(f).

          Section 7.3 Limitations on Claims.

          (a) Liability Basket. Notwithstanding anything in this Article VII to
the contrary, (A) Parent shall not be entitled to make a claim on the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Section 7.1(a), unless and until the aggregate amount of
Damages incurred by Parent for which Parent is entitled to make a claim on the
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.1(a) (other than Damages resulting from
breaches or inaccuracies of the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.1 (Organization and Qualification; Charter Documents), 3.2 (Corporate
Authorization; Enforceability; Board and Stockholder Action), 3.4
(Capitalization), 3.10(f) (Company Options and Company Warrants), 3.11 (Taxes)
and 3.18 (Finders' or Advisors' Fees) which are the subject of the last sentence
of this Section 7.3(a)), equals or exceeds an amount equal to Four Million Four
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($4,450,000) (the "Liability Basket"); provided,
however, that once the Liability Basket has been reached, Parent shall be
entitled to make a claim on the Escrow Fund under Section 7.1(a) only for the
amount of Damages in excess of the Liability Basket. Notwithstanding anything in
this Article VII to the contrary, any claim on the Escrow Fund to which Parent
shall become entitled as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of Sections 3.1,
3.2, 3.4, 3.10(f), 3.11 and 3.18 shall be available without regard to the
Liability Basket.

          (b) Maximum Liability. Subject to Section 7.3(d), notwithstanding
anything in this Article VII to the contrary, the aggregate maximum amount
available to Parent for claims on the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.1 and
Section 5.12 shall be limited to amount of the Escrow Fund held pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement from time to time and Parent acknowledges and agrees that
neither the Stakeholder Representative nor any Stakeholder shall have any
obligation to replenish or contribute any amounts to the Escrow Fund under any
circumstances.

          (c) Additional Limitations.

               (i) The amount of any Damages incurred by Parent and the Company
     shall be reduced by the net amount Parent or the Company or any of their
     Subsidiaries recovers (after deducting all attorneys' fees, expenses and
     other costs of recovery) from any insurer or other party liable for such
     Damages. Parent and the Company and their Subsidiaries shall use
     commercially reasonable efforts to effect any such recovery.

               (ii) Any entitlement of Parent to make a claim against the Escrow
     Fund under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of
     recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such claim
     constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant
     or agreement.


                                       58

<PAGE>

               (iii) The items set forth on or reflected in the Company's
     Statement, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Determination, the Final Closing
     Balance Sheet or the Preliminary Working Capital Amount, the Final Working
     Capital Amount, the Preliminary BIPA Refund Amount, the BIPA Statement or
     the Final BIPA Refund Amount, and any matters relating thereto that could
     have been subject to adjustment or dispute (other than such matters not
     known prior to final resolution of the Final Working Capital Amount, the
     Final Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Final BIPA Refund Amount, as the
     case may be), in each case pursuant to Article II or Section 7.5 (as
     applicable), and any other amounts or items that were adjusted or disputed
     in the course of the Article II or Section 7.5 process (such items so set
     forth or reflected, such matters relating thereto and such other amounts
     and items, collectively, the "Article II/Section 7.5 Items"), are subject
     solely to the adjustments set forth in Article II and Section 7.5 hereof,
     respectively, and accordingly shall not be subject to any claim by Parent
     or Merger Subsidiary on the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article VII. In no
     event shall any matter, facts or circumstances pertaining to any Article
     II/Section 7.5 Item, which would also constitute a breach of a
     representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the Financial
     Statements or any other provision hereof, give rise to any claim by Parent
     on the Escrow Fund under this Article VII.

               (iv) In no event shall any party hereto be liable for, and Parent
     acknowledges and agrees that the term "Damages" expressly excludes, any
     consequential, treble, punitive or other damages not expressly provided for
     in this Article VII.

               (v) The amount of any Damages sustained by Parent shall be
     reduced by the amount of any Tax Benefit realized with respect to such
     Damages. "Tax Benefit" shall mean the Tax savings attributable to any
     deduction, expense, loss, credit or refund to the Parent or its Affiliates,
     when incurred or received; provided, however, that if such benefit is
     reasonably expected to arise or be utilized after the year in which the
     Escrow Account is terminated, then it means the present value of such Tax
     savings (discounted using one year LIBOR (as published in The Wall Street
     Journal) and a Tax rate equal to the sum of the highest marginal U.S.
     federal corporate income Tax rate or rates applicable to ordinary income or
     capital gain, as the case may be, in effect for the taxable period in issue
     plus five percent (5%)).

               (vi) If Parent or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries
     receives an amount under insurance coverage or from any Person or a Tax
     Benefit becomes realizable with respect to Damages sustained at any time
     subsequent to any payment to Parent from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this
     Article VII, then Parent shall promptly reimburse the Escrow Fund for any
     payment made or expense incurred by the Stakeholder Representative in
     connection with such payment up to such amount received or realizable by
     Parent, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Ancillary
     Agreement to the contrary, the amount of any Damages shall also be reduced
     to the extent that Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, as the
     case may be, is effectively held


                                       59

<PAGE>

     harmless or otherwise compensated for such Damages other than pursuant to
     this Article VII.

               (vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
     Parent shall be entitled to make a claim on the Escrow Fund pursuant to
     Section 7.1(c) and with respect to a Specified Claim only with respect to
     fifty percent (50%) of each dollar of Damages with respect to such matter.
     Parent acknowledges and agrees that it shall be responsible for fifty
     percent (50%) of each dollar of Damages pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and with
     respect to any Specified Claim without recourse to the Escrow Fund
     whatsoever. In any Specified Claim Notice and in any notice or payment
     request form delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
     Agreement, Parent shall set forth the full amount of the Damages it claims
     arise out of Section 7.1(c) from time to time, as well as calculate the
     fifty percent (50%) reduction required by this Section 7.3(c)(vii).

          (d) Survival of Representations and Warranties; Claims Period.

               (i) The representations and warranties of the Company contained
     in Article III of this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of
     twelve (12) months; provided, however, that the representations and
     warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.10(f), 3.11 and 3.18
     shall survive the Closing for a period of twenty-four (24) months. Any and
     all claims of Parent on the Escrow Fund under this Article VII arising out
     of the inaccuracy or breach of any such representation or warranty of
     Seller or Purchaser and Parent must be made prior to the termination of
     such survival period; it being understood that in the event Parent shall
     have timely delivered notice of any claim on the Escrow Fund pursuant to
     Section 7.1(a), such claim shall survive until such time as such claim is
     finally resolved. The representations and warranties of the Company
     continued in this Agreement shall not survive any termination hereof.

               (ii) In accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, for a
     period of twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date, Parent shall be
     entitled to make claims against the Escrow Fund with respect to Damages
     arising out of or resulting from, or amounts payable with respect to, the
     matters set forth in Sections 7.1 (other than Section 7.1(a), which is the
     subject of Section 7.4(d)(i) and subject to the limitation in Section
     7.3(d)(iii)); it being understood that in the event Parent shall have
     timely delivered notice of any claim on the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
     7.1, such claim shall survive until such time as such claim is finally
     resolved. The parties intend to shorten the statute of limitations and
     agree that, after the Closing Date, any claim or cause of action against
     any of the parties hereto, or any of their respective directors, officers,
     employees, Affiliates, successors, permitted assigns, or Representatives
     based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the representations or
     warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or any
     other agreement, document or instrument to be executed and delivered in
     connection with this Agreement may be brought only as expressly provided in
     this Article VII.

               (iii) The parties hereby agree that in the event that the United
     States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois shall not
     have issued any subpoena, instituted any formal action, suit or proceeding
     or other legal process or formal or informal inquiry evidencing a
     continuing investigation for any period of twelve (12) consecutive months
     following the Effective Time, then Parent's right to make a claim against
     the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.1(c) shall expire and terminate and
     be of no further force or effect from and after such period.

               (iv) Exclusive Remedy. The parties agree that except for any
     claims seeking injunctive specific performance or other equitable relief
     (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.12) of this Agreement
     and except for claims involving fraud, from and after the Closing, the
     right to make a claim on the Escrow Fund provided for in this Article VII
     pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII and Section 5.12 shall be
     the exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving
     Corporation and their respective Affiliates, Representatives, successors
     and assigns (other than the Company's and its Subsidiaries' directors,
     officers, employees, agents and representatives) for any breach of or
     inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or any non-compliance with or
     breach of or default in the performance of any of the covenants or
     agreements contained in this Agreement and none of Parent, Merger
     Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to a rescission
     of this Agreement or to any indemnification or other rights or claims of
     any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which Parent and Merger
     Subsidiary (for themselves and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation and
     their Representatives) hereby irrevocably waive.

          Section 7.4 Disputes. In the event of a post-Closing dispute between
the Parent and the Stakeholder Representative relating to any Claim other than a
Third Party Claim that is the subject of litigation ("Escrow Fund Dispute") or
any claim subject to Section 5.12 or Section 7.5, the Stakeholder Representative
and Parent shall seek in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such Escrow
Fund Dispute within ninety (90) days of receipt by the Stakeholder
Representative of a Claim Notice. If the Stakeholder Representative and Parent
are not able to so resolve such Escrow Fund Dispute, all of the parties hereto
agree that such Escrow Fund Dispute shall be exclusively and finally settled by
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA then
in effect (the "Rules"), except as modified herein. The place of arbitration
shall be Chicago, Illinois. If the amount in controversy is one million dollars
($1,000,000) or less (including all claims and counterclaims) there shall be one
arbitrator who shall be agreed upon by the parties within twenty (20) days of
receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. If the amount in
controversy is more than one million dollars ($1,000,000) (including all claims
and counterclaims) there shall be three neutral and impartial arbitrators, one
of whom shall be appointed by Parent and one of whom shall be appointed by the
Stakeholder Representative within twenty (20) days of receipt by respondent(s)
of a copy of the demand for arbitration. The two arbitrators so appointed shall
agree on a third arbitrator, who shall serve of chair of the arbitral tribunal,
within twenty (20) days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. If any
arbitrator is not


                                       61

<PAGE>
appointed within the time limit provided herein, such arbitrator shall be
appointed by the AAA in accordance with the listing, striking and ranking
procedure in the Rules. Any arbitrator appointed by the AAA shall be a retired
judge or a practicing attorney with no less than fifteen years of experience
with large commercial cases and an experienced arbitrator. In rendering an
award, the arbitral tribunal shall be required to follow the laws of the State
of Delaware. The arbitral tribunal is not empowered to award damages in excess
of compensatory damages, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to
recover punitive, exemplary or similar damages with respect to any Escrow Fund
Dispute. Any arbitration proceedings, decision or award rendered hereunder and
the validity, effect and interpretation of this arbitration agreement shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq. The award
shall be in writing and shall briefly state the findings of fact and conclusions
of law on which it is based. The award shall be final and binding upon Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Stakeholder
Representative and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties
regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting presented to the
arbitrator(s). Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Stakeholder Representative agrees that it will not have any
right to, and will not, institute any other Action of any kind challenging such
award or with respect to an Escrow Fund Dispute, except that the foregoing shall
not preclude an Action to enforce any award issued hereunder.

          Section 7.5 BIPA Claim.

          (a) Parent shall be entitled to make a claim on the Escrow Fund in
accordance with this Section 7.5 for an amount equal to the estimate of the
amount, calculated pursuant to this Section 7.5, that the Company would have
been required to pay as a refund to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
("CMS") under the Medicare Demonstration Project for Disease Management for
Severely Chronically Ill Medicare Beneficiaries with Congestive Heart Failure,
Diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease (Cooperative Agreement #95-W-0087/5) by and
between CMS and the Company (the "Demonstration Agreement"), based on the
Company's failure to achieve certain savings objectives under the Demonstration
Agreement during the period beginning on the date on which the demonstration
contemplated by the Demonstration Agreement commenced and ending on the Closing
Date (the "Measurement Period") and without regard to performance after the end
of the Measurement Period. Any such amount is referred to herein as the BIPA
Refund Amount (the "BIPA Refund Amount").

          (b) The BIPA Refund Amount shall be determined based on a
reconciliation to be performed in accordance with the procedures outlined in the
Demonstration Agreement following the Measurement Period as modified by this
Section 7.5. Not earlier than the nine (9) month anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare the reconciliation for the Measurement Period in
accordance with the procedures outlined in the Demonstration Agreement using the
best available claims data that has been provided to the Company as of such time
by CMS or its representatives. If complete claims data is not available for the
full Measurement Period (including, without limitation, claims data relative to
claims incurred during the Measurement Period and


                                       62

<PAGE>

processed within nine (9) months of the end of the Measurement Period), such
data as is available will be extrapolated consistent with customary actuarial
practices over the full Measurement Period. The calculation of the BIPA Refund
Amount shall take into account, and the BIPA Refund Amount shall be reduced by
any amounts refunded to CMS out of, the escrow established pursuant to the terms
of the Demonstration Agreement.

          (c) Not later than the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing
Date, Parent shall deliver the Stakeholder Representative a statement containing
its calculation of the BIPA Refund Amount (the "Preliminary BIPA Refund Amount")
together with all documentation supporting the Company's calculation of the BIPA
Refund Amount (such statement and supporting documentation, (the "BIPA
Statement").

          (d) Upon receipt of the BIPA Statement, the Stakeholder Representative
shall have forty-five (45) days (the "BIPA Review Period") to review such BIPA
Statement. In connection with the review of the BIPA Statement, Parent shall
give, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its and the Surviving
Corporation's Affiliates and Representatives to give, to the Stakeholder
Representative and its Representatives full access to the books, records and
other materials of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries and
the personnel of, and work papers prepared by or for, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their Subsidiaries and their respective accountants and
Representatives, including to such historical financial information and claims
data relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Demonstration
Agreement as the Stakeholder Representative or its Representatives may request,
in each case, in connection with reviewing of the BIPA Statement in accordance
with this Section 7.5. If the Stakeholder Representative has accepted such BIPA
Statement in writing or has not given written notice to Parent setting forth any
objection of the Stakeholder Representative to such BIPA Statement (a "BIPA
Statement of Objections") prior to the expiration of the BIPA Review Period,
then such BIPA Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the
Preliminary BIPA Refund Amount shall be deemed the BIPA Refund Amount (the
"Final BIPA Refund Amount"). In the event that the Stakeholder Representative
delivers a BIPA Statement of Objections during the BIPA Review Period, Parent
and the Stakeholder Representative shall use their reasonable efforts to agree
on the BIPA Refund Amount within thirty (30) days following the receipt by
Parent of the BIPA Statement of Objections. If the parties are unable to reach
an agreement as to the BIPA Refund Amount then the matter shall be submitted as
promptly as practicable to Milleman, or such independent actuarial firm mutually
acceptable to each of the parties (such person, the "BIPA Arbitrator"), who
shall resolve the matters still in dispute and adjust the Preliminary BIPA
Refund Amount to reflect such resolution and establish the Final BIPA Refund
Amount; provided, however, that the BIPA Arbitrator may not determine a BIPA
Refund Amount in excess of that claimed by Parent or less than that claimed by
the Stakeholder Representative. The BIPA Arbitrator shall make such
determination within forty-five (45) days following the submission of the matter
to the BIPA Arbitrator for resolution, and such determination shall be final and
binding upon Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Stakeholder Representative and
may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Each of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the


                                       63

<PAGE>

Stakeholder Representative agrees that it will not have any right to, and will
not, institute any Action of any kind challenging such determination or with
respect to the matters that are the subject of this Section 7.5, except that the
foregoing shall not preclude an Action to enforce such determination.

          Section 7.6 Release of Escrow Funds. The parties hereby agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

          (a) Interim Release Date. On the date which is the later of (a) two
(2) Business Days following payment of the BIPA Refund Amount, if any, or the
determination by the BIPA Arbitrator that Parent is not entitled to a BIPA
Refund Amount, and (b) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date
(such later date, the "Interim Distribution Date"), all Escrow Funds in excess
of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) that are not the subject of a Claim Notice,
a Specified Claim Notice or a dispute pursuant to Section 2.9 or 5.12 that has
not been resolved (an "Outstanding Claim") shall be distributed from the Escrow
Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative hereby agree that it shall, not later than two (2) Business Days
following the Interim Distribution Date, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
a Payment Request Form or Forms (as such term is defined in the Escrow
Agreement) directing that the Escrow Agent make disbursements of Escrow Funds
contemplated by this Section 7.6(a) within two (2) Business Days of receipt of
such Payment Request Form or Forms.

          (b) Release Date. On the date which is the twenty four (24) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Release Date") all Escrow Funds that are
not the subject of an Outstanding Claim shall be distributed from the Escrow
Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative hereby agree that it shall, not later than two (2) Business Days
following the Release Date, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Payment
Request Form or Forms (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement)
directing that the Escrow Agent make disbursements of Escrow Funds contemplated
by this Section 7.6(b) within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such Payment
Request Form or Forms.

          (c) Resolution of Outstanding Claims Following the Release Date.
Following the Release Date, upon resolution of any Outstanding Claim without
full payment of such Outstanding Claim to Parent, all or such portion of such
Outstanding Claim that is not paid to Parent shall be distributed from the
Escrow Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative hereby agree that it shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent Payment Request Form or Forms with respect to such amount not later than
two (2) Business Days following the resolution without payment to Parent of all
or any portion of such Outstanding Claim. Following the resolution of the last
Outstanding Claim, all remaining Escrow Funds shall be distributed from the
Escrow Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative hereby agree that it shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a Payment Request Form or Forms with respect to the remaining Escrow Funds
not later than two (2) Business Days following the resolution of the last
remaining Outstanding Claim following the Release Date.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            TERMINATION AND EXPENSES

          Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (except as
provided below, notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company):

          (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

          (b) by either the Company or Parent,

               (i) if the Merger has not been consummated as of March 1, 2006,
     (the "End Date"); provided, however, that if the waiting period under the
     HSR Act has not expired or been terminated by March 1, 2006, and the
     condition to the Merger set forth in Section 6.1(b) shall not have been
     fulfilled but all other conditions to the Merger shall have been fulfilled
     or shall be capable of being fulfilled, then either party may (on one or
     more occasions) by written notice delivered to the other party on or prior
     to March 1, 2006, extend the End Date to July 31, 2006 and, in the case of
     such an extension, all references in this Agreement to the End Date shall
     mean July 31, 2006;

               (ii) if there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the
     Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or if any Restraint enjoining
     Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company from consummating the Merger is
     entered and such Restraint shall become final and nonappealable; provided,
     however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
     8.1(b)(ii) is not available to a party that has not fulfilled its
     obligations under Section 5.5; or

               (iii) if there shall have been a breach by the other of any of
     its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in this
     Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more
     of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) (in the case of a breach by
     the Company), or Section 6.3(a) (in the case of a breach by Parent), and in
     any such case such breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable
     of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the End Date.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b) of this
Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in
accordance with Section 9.4, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is effected.

          Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with
no liability or further obligation on the part of any party hereto except (a)
that this Section 8.2, Section 5.3(b), Section 8.3, Article IX and the
agreements contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (to the extent set forth
therein), shall survive the termination hereof, (b) that no such termination
shall (i) relieve any party of any liability or damages


                                       65

<PAGE>

resulting from any willful or intentional breach by that party of its covenants
under this Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing Date or (ii) relieve
Parent or Merger Subsidiary from liability to the Company or the Stakeholders
for any breach of Section 4.8 or Section 5.13 (whether such breach is willful or
intentional, or not willful and not intentional) and (c) that Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that any failure of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
for any reason to obtain the Funds, or to be in a position to immediately
satisfy the Funding Obligations, in either case on or prior to the Financing
Deadline shall be a material breach by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this
Agreement, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be liable to the Company and
the Stakeholders for such breach notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement.

          Section 8.3 Fees and Expenses.

          (a) Other than as specifically provided in this Section 8.3 or as
required by applicable Law, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such costs or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except that (i) all printing, mailing and related expenses incurred
in connection with the printing and mailing of the Information Statement shall
be shared equally by Parent and the Company and (ii) filing fees payable under
or pursuant to the HSR Act shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company, in
the case of clause (i) or (ii) whether or not the Merger is consummated.

          (b) At least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent in writing a certificate setting forth (i) the amount of
Company Transaction Expenses, estimated, in good faith, by the Company that are
expected to remain unpaid as of the Closing Date and (ii) a list of each Person
entitled to any Company Transaction Expenses, including wire transfer or other
payment information. At the Closing, unless the Company shall have previously
paid such Company Transaction Expenses, Parent shall cause the payment (in
accordance with the certificate delivered by the Company in accordance with this
Section 8.3(b)) of the Company Transaction Expenses directly to those Persons so
designated by the Company.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          Section 9.1 Independent Investigation. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the
business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects of the Company and any financial statements
relating to the Company, and acknowledges that the Company has provided Parent
with access to the personnel, properties, premises and books and records of the
Company for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary has relied solely
upon its own investigation and analysis, and each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees (i) that, except for the specific
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article III hereof,
none of


                                       66

<PAGE>

the Company or its Affiliates nor any of their respective shareholders,
controlling persons or Representatives makes or has made any representation or
warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
of the information (including any statement, certificate, document or agreement
delivered pursuant to Article II hereof and any financial statements and any
projections, estimates or other forward-looking information); provided
(including in any management presentations, information or descriptive
memorandum, supplemental information or other materials or information with
respect to any of the above) or otherwise made available to Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates, shareholders, controlling persons or
Representatives and (ii) that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company and its Affiliates and their respective Subsidiaries,
controlling persons or Representatives shall not have any liability or
responsibility whatsoever to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their Affiliates or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, shareholders, controlling persons or
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or made
available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or their Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
shareholders, controlling persons or Representatives, including in respect of
the specific representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article
III of this Agreement, except as and only to the extent expressly set forth in

subject to the limitations and restrictions contained in this Agreement.

          Section 9.2 Non-survival of Parent Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Subsidiary contained in
Article IV of this Agreement shall survive the Closing for twenty-four (24)
months, it being understood that in the event that any claims with respect to a
breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of their representations and warranties
shall survive until such time as such claim is finally resolved.

          Section 9.3 Amendments; No Waivers.

          (a) Any provision of this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits hereto) may be amended or
waived prior to the Effective Time, if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is
in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the

in accordance with the rules and regulations of the applicable national
securities exchange require further approval of the shareholders of the Company,
the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval
of the shareholders of the Company.

          (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by Law.

original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

          Section 9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Escrow Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement

          Section 9.11 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such

agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants

other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive
relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such
party's obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder, without bond or other security being
required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

          Section 9.13 No Setoff. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees (on their own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) that it and its
Affiliates shall have no right hereunder or pursuant to applicable Law to, and
will not, offset any amounts due and owing (or to become due and owing) under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to any other party hereto or thereto
or such party's Affiliates against any amounts due and owing from such other
party or such other party's Affiliates under this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or any other agreement, contract or understanding.

          3.1. The Parties acknowledge that the Stakeholder Representative is

     4. Delivery of Escrow Amount.

          4.1. Parent acknowledges that, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Parent is depositing the Escrow Amount in an account
(the "Escrow Account") with the Escrow Agent. The funds in the Escrow Account,

          5.1. The Escrow Agent shall disburse Escrow Funds on deposit in the
Escrow Account to Parent, the Stakeholder Representative (or as directed by the
Stakeholder Representative) or both, as the case may be, within two (2) Business
Days following receipt of:

               (a) one or more fully executed Payment Request Forms in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2, executed by Parent and the
Stakeholder Representative, and otherwise pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon
receipt of a Payment Request Form, the amounts specified therein shall be paid
by the Escrow Agent within (2) Business Days directly to the Party or Parties
entitled to payment as specified in the Payment Request Form. Each of Parent and
the Stakeholder Representative hereby agree that within two (2) Business Days
after final resolution of any matter pursuant to Sections 2.9, 5.12 and 7.5 of
the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Stakeholder Representative shall execute a
Payment Request Form or Forms directing the Escrow Agent to make the
disbursements of Escrow Funds within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such
Payment Request Form or Forms; or

               (b) a copy of a Final Determination setting forth a Party's right
to the Escrow Funds, together with a Certificate in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 3 (a "Certificate").

          5.2. Indemnification. If Parent asserts a claim for Damages pursuant
to Section 7.2 of the Merger Agreement (a "Claim") against the Stakeholders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which Parent agrees it will do only in good
faith, Parent shall send a copy of


                                      -3-

<PAGE>

written notice of such Claim (a "Claim Notice") at the same time to the Escrow
Agent and to the Stakeholder Representative. In the case of a Claim Notice in
respect of a Third Party Claim, such Claim Notice shall specify the nature of
such Action and the amount or estimated amount thereof (which amount or
estimated amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount, if any, of such
Action). In submitting such Claim to the Escrow Agent, Parent shall account for
any applicable threshold, exclusion or cap and other limitation on Damages
provided for in the Merger Agreement. Whenever Parent sends such a Claim Notice,
the Parties shall comply with the procedures set forth herein.

               (a) The Escrow Agent shall immediately confirm in writing to the
Stakeholder Representative (a "Confirmation") the date on which the Escrow Agent
received the Claim Notice. Concurrently with its delivery of the Confirmation
the Escrow Agent will deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to the Stakeholder
Representative. If the Stakeholder Representative decides, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to dispute the Claim described in the Claim Notice, the
Stakeholder Representative shall, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day
following the Stakeholder Representative's receipt of the Confirmation and the
Claim Notice, send to the Escrow Agent and Parent a written objection to such
Claim.

               (b) If the Escrow Agent does not receive from the Stakeholder
Representative a written objection to such Claim Notice on or before the
thirtieth (30th) day following the Stakeholder Representative's receipt of the
Confirmation and the Claim Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall make a
disbursement to Parent from the Escrow Funds in the amount of the Claim
described in such Claim Notice. If the Escrow Agent receives a timely written
objection to only a portion of a Claim Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall make
a disbursement to Parent from the Escrow Funds in the amount of the Claim not
subject to the written objection.

               (c) If the Escrow Agent receives from the Stakeholder
Representative a written objection to such Claim on or before the thirtieth
(30th) day following the Stakeholder Representative's receipt from the Escrow
Agent of notice of receipt of the Confirmation and the Claim Notice, the Escrow
Agent shall hold the funds subject to such dispute until a Payment Request Form
or Forms executed by Parent and the Stakeholder Representative directing the
Escrow Agent to make the disbursements of Escrow Funds within two (2) Business
Days of receipt of such Payment Request Form or Forms or a Final Determination
and a Certificate is delivered with respect thereto.

          5.3. Timed Release of Escrow Funds.

          (a) Interim Release Date. On the date which is the later of (i) two
(2) Business Days following payment of the BIPA Refund Amount pursuant to
Section 7.5 of the Merger Agreement, if any, or the determination by the BIPA
Arbitrator that Parent is not entitled to a BIPA Refund Amount, and (ii) the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (such later date, the "Interim
Distribution Date"), all Escrow Funds in excess of Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) that are not the subject of a Claim Notice, a Specified Claim
Notice or a dispute pursuant to Section 2.9 or 5.12 that has not been resolved
(an "Outstanding Claim") shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent from the
Escrow Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative hereby agree that it shall, not later than two (2)


                                      -4-

<PAGE>

Business Days following the Interim Distribution Date, execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent a Payment Request Form or Forms (as such term is defined in the
Escrow Agreement) directing that the Escrow Agent make disbursements of Escrow
Funds contemplated by this Section 5.3(a) within two (2) Business Days of
receipt of such Payment Request Form or Forms.

          (b) Release Date. On the date which is the twenty four (24) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Release Date") all Escrow Funds that are
not the subject of an Outstanding Claim shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent
from the Escrow Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and the
Stakeholder Representative hereby agree that it shall, not later than two (2)
Business Days following the Release Date, execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a Payment Request Form or Forms (as such term is defined in the Escrow
Agreement) directing that the Escrow Agent make disbursements of Escrow Funds
contemplated by this Section 5.3(b) within two (2) Business Days of receipt of
such Payment Request Form or Forms.

          (c) Resolution of Outstanding Claims Following the Release Date.
Following the Release Date, upon resolution of any Outstanding Claim without
full payment of such Outstanding Claim to Parent, all or such portion of such
Outstanding Claim that is not paid to Parent shall be distributed from the
Escrow Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative hereby agree that it shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent Payment Request Form or Forms with respect to such amount not later than
two (2) Business Days following the resolution without payment to Parent of all
or any portion of such Outstanding Claim. Following the resolution of the last
Outstanding Claim, all remaining Escrow Funds shall be distributed by the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Account to the Agent's Escrow Account. Each of Parent and
the Stakeholder Representative hereby agree that it shall execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent a Payment Request Form or Forms with respect to the remaining
Escrow Funds not later than two (2) Business Days following the resolution of
the last remaining Outstanding Claim following the Release Date.

     6. Payments from the Escrow Funds.

          6.1. The Escrow Agent shall make no payments from the Escrow Funds
unless permitted pursuant to Section 5.

          6.2. Any amounts payable by the Escrow Agent under this Agreement
shall be paid by bank check or by wire transfer, as specified in the Payment
Request Form or Final Determination received by the Escrow Agent. In the event
funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of the
execution of the Agreement), such instructions shall be in writing by the person
or persons designated on Exhibit 4 hereto and the Escrow Agent is authorized to
seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on Exhibit 4 hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated.
The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing
actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The Parties to this
Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is commercially reasonable.
It is understood that the Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any funds
transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number
provided by any Party hereto to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the
beneficiary's bank or (iii) an


                                      -5-

<PAGE>

intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even where its use may result in a
person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank
other than the beneficiary's bank, or an intermediary bank, designated.

          6.3. All interest and other income received from or earned on the
Escrow Funds shall become a part of the Escrow Funds and be paid in accordance
with the other terms of this Agreement.

     7. Tax Matters.

          7.1. The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest
or other income earned from the investment of the Escrow Funds shall be
allocable to Parent and so reported to the Internal Revenue Service and any
other applicable taxing authority, except to the extent that any law or
regulation should otherwise require.

          7.2. Parent agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax
identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8, in the
case of non-U.S. persons) to the Escrow Agent on or prior to the date hereof.
Parent understands that, in the event its tax identification number is not
certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal Revenue Code may require withholding
of a portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the
Escrow Funds, in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time
to time.

          7.3. The Escrow Agent shall distribute quarterly to Parent amounts
intended to cover the potential federal, state or local tax obligations of
Parent on account of the cumulative allocation to Parent of taxable income
attributable to the interest and other income earned on the Escrow Funds. Such
distributions shall be made with respect to each quarter prior to the date that
United States taxpayers are required to make estimated federal tax payments with
respect to such quarter, as soon as practical after receipt by the Escrow Agent
of a written request of Parent, with a copy to the Stakeholder Representative.
For purposes of the foregoing, such federal, state and local tax obligations of
the Parent shall be assumed to equal an effective combined federal and state
income tax rate equal to thirty-five percent (35%) or such other rate as
provided in an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to Section 21 hereof.

          7.4. The Escrow Agent shall report to the Internal Revenue Service
against Parent, as of each calendar year-end, all income earned from the Escrow
Funds, whether or not such income has been distributed during such year, as and
to the extent required by law. Parent shall prepare and file any necessary tax
returns with respect to income earned on the Escrow Funds, and the Escrow Agent
shall have no duty to prepare or file any tax returns with respect to the Escrow
Account.

          7.5. Parent shall pay all taxes payable on income earned from the
investment of the Escrow Funds, whether or not the Escrow Agent distributed the
income during any particular year.

     8. Escrow Agent's Duties.


                                      -6-

<PAGE>

          8.1. The Escrow Agent's duties are entirely ministerial and not
discretionary, and the Escrow Agent will be under no duty or obligation to give
any notice, or to do or to omit the doing of any action with respect to the
Escrow Funds, except to give notice, make disbursements and invest the Escrow
Funds in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          8.2. The Escrow Agent will neither be responsible for, nor chargeable
with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument
or document among the other Parties hereto, in connection herewith, including
without limitation the Merger Agreement (other than for terms used and not
otherwise defined herein but defined therein), and will be required to act only
pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement sets
forth all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder, and no
additional obligations of the Escrow Agent will be inferred from the terms of
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement.

          8.3. The Escrow Agent will not be liable for any error in judgment or
any act or steps taken or permitted to be taken in good faith, or for any
mistake of law or fact, or for anything it may do or refrain from doing in
connection with this Agreement, except for its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence. As to any legal questions arising in connection with the
administration of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may consult with and rely
absolutely upon the opinions give to it by counsel (including internal counsel)
and shall be free of liability for acting in reliance on such opinions.

          8.4. The Escrow Agent will not be required in any way to determine the
validity, genuineness, authenticity or sufficiency, whether in form or
substance, of any instrument, document, certificate, statement or notice
referred to in this Agreement or contemplated by this Agreement, or the identity
or authority of the persons executing it, and it will be sufficient if any
writing purporting to be such instrument, document, certificate, statement or
notice is delivered to the Escrow Agent and purports to be correct in form and
signed or otherwise executed by the Party or Parties required to sign or execute
it under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent reserves the right, but shall in no
way be obligated, to call upon the Parties, or any of them, for written
instructions before taking any actions hereunder.

          8.5. During the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
exercise on its own behalf any right of set-off against, or enforce any lien on,
the Escrow Funds, except such right or lien as may arise in connection with this
Agreement, particularly Sections 10 and 13 hereof.

          8.7 IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY
KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW
AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

          8.8 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall not be obligated to perform any obligation hereunder and shall not
incur any liability for the nonperformance or breach of any obligation hereunder
to the extent that the Escrow Agent is


                                      -7-

<PAGE>

delayed in performing, unable to perform or breaches such obligation because of
acts of God, war, terrorism, fire, floods, strikes, electrical outages,
equipment or transmission failures, or other causes reasonably beyond its
control.

     9. Disputes.

          9.1. It is understood and agreed that should any dispute arise with
respect to the payment and/or ownership or right of possession of the Escrow
Funds, or should the Escrow Agent be uncertain as to what action to take with
respect to the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to
retain in its possession, without liability to anyone, all or any part of the
Escrow Funds until such dispute or uncertainty shall have been settled either by
mutual agreement by the Parties (as evidenced by a written agreement among them)
or by a Final Determination.

          9.2. If the Escrow Agent becomes involved in litigation by reason of
this Agreement, or if the Escrow Agent reasonably believes, in its sole
discretion, that it may become involved in litigation, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to institute a bill of interpleader in a court in Wilmington,
Delaware to determine the rights of the Parties and to deposit the Escrow Funds
with the court in accordance with Delaware law. Upon deposit of the Escrow Funds
with the court, the Escrow Agent shall stand fully relieved and discharged of
any further duties as Escrow Agent.

          9.3. If a bill of interpleader is instituted, or if the Escrow Agent
is threatened with litigation or becomes involved in litigation in any manner
whichever on account of this Agreement or the Escrow Funds, Parent and the
Stakeholder Representative, jointly and severally, shall pay the Escrow Agent
its reasonable attorneys' fees and any other disbursements, expenses, losses,
costs and damages incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with or resulting
from such threatened or actual litigation. All costs and expenses of such
dispute will be charged to the non-prevailing Party in such dispute, unless such
non-prevailing Party is a third Party, in which case the Escrow Agent's costs
and expenses will be charged to and paid out of the Escrow Funds, and to the
extent the Escrow Funds are insufficient, will be charged equally to Parent, on
the one hand, and the Stakeholder Representative, on the other hand; provided,
that the Stakeholder Representative's obligations pursuant to this Section 9.3
shall be satisfied only from and shall not exceed the amount of funds, if any,
held pursuant to the Agent's Escrow Agreement.

          9.4. In the event that the Escrow Agent is directed pursuant to
Section 5 hereof to disburse to the Stakeholders any portion of the Escrow
Funds, the disbursement of which the Escrow Agent had previously withheld
pursuant to this section, the Escrow Agent shall disburse such amount to, or as
directed by, the Stakeholder Representative. In the event that the Escrow Agent
is directed pursuant to Section 5 hereof to disburse to Parent any portion of
the Escrow Funds, the disbursement of which the Escrow Agent had previously
withheld pursuant to this section, the Escrow Agent shall disburse such amount
to Parent.

     10. Indemnity. Parent and the Stakeholder Representative jointly and
severally agree to hold the Escrow Agent harmless and to indemnify the Escrow
Agent against any loss, liability,


                                      -8-

<PAGE>

expenses (including reasonable outside and inhouse attorney's fees and expenses
and fees and expenses of experts and their staffs), proceeding, penalty, cost,
claim, or demand arising out of or in connection with the performance of its
obligations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement ("Losses"),
unless such Losses shall have been finally adjudicated to have been primarily
caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Escrow Agent.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to set-off against the Escrow Funds and apply such set-off to
payment of such fees and disbursements and other liabilities and obligations
hereunder. The foregoing indemnities in this paragraph shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.
The indemnity by the Stakeholder Representative set forth in this Section 10 is
not personal to the Stakeholder Representative and shall be satisfied only from
and shall not exceed the amount of funds, if any, held pursuant to the Agent's
Escrow Agreement.

     11. Investment.

          11.1. As used in this section, "Eligible Investments" include one or
more of the following obligations or securities, but only to the extent that
such obligations or securities mature within thirty (30) calendar days or such
longer time as the Stakeholder Representative and Parent shall determine, such
longer maturities not to exceed eighteen months from the Closing Date: (a)
direct obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed by, the United States of
America or any agency thereof, (b) money market funds investing primarily in the
obligations or securities listed in clause (a) above or repurchase agreements
fully collateralized by direct obligations of the United States of America and
(c) demand or time deposits, money market accounts and interest bearing accounts
of a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of
America or any state thereof and having capital and surplus in excess of One
Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000).

          11.2. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrow Funds in such Eligible
Investments as the Stakeholder Representative and Parent, from time to time,
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing, and in the absence of any
such instruction, shall invest in the Wells Fargo Advantage, Government Money
Market Fund. Earnings upon Eligible Investments shall be deemed part of the
Escrow Funds, shall be deposited in the Escrow Account and shall be disbursed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any diminution which may result from any
investments or reinvestments made in accordance with this Agreement.

          11.3. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Agent will not
provide supervision, recommendations or advice relative to either the investment
of the Escrow Funds or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any
Eligible Investment.

          11.4. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and
sales of Eligible Investments through its own trading or capital markets
operations. The Escrow Agent shall send statements to Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative reflecting activity for the Escrow Account for the preceding
month within fifteen (15) days after the last day of each month. Although the
Parties acknowledge that they may obtain a broker confirmation or written
statement containing comparable information at no additional cost, each Party
hereby agrees that


                                      -9-

<PAGE>

confirmations of Eligible Investments are not required to be issued by the
Escrow Agent for each period in which a statement is provided.

          11.5. Any loss or expense incurred from an Eligible Investment shall
be borne by the Escrow Funds.

     12. Resignation.

          12.1. The Escrow Agent may resign upon thirty (30) calendar days'
prior written notice to the Stakeholder Representative and Parent, and, upon
joint instructions from the Stakeholder Representative and Parent, will deliver
the Escrow Funds to any designated substitute Escrow Agent selected by the
Stakeholder Representative and Parent. If the Stakeholder Representative and
Parent fail to designate a substitute Escrow Agent within 15 calendar days after
receipt of such notice, the Escrow Agent may, at its sole discretion, institute
a bill of interpleader as contemplated by Section 9 above for the purpose of
having an appropriate court designate a substitute Escrow Agent.

          12.2. Any company into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any company resulting from
any merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a Party, or any
company to which the Escrow Agent may sell or transfer all or substantially all
of its corporate trust business shall be the successor to the Escrow Agent
without the execution or filing of any paper or the performance of any further
act, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary.

     13. Compensation. Parent and Stakeholders agree that the fees and expenses
of the Escrow Agent, including any investment fees and other investment-related
charges, for services rendered, including the basic fees set forth in Exhibit 5
attached hereto, shall be paid out of the Escrow Funds. In the event that the
Escrow Funds shall be insufficient to pay the fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent, 50% of such fees and expenses shall be payable by Parent and 50% of such
fees and expenses shall be payable by the Stakeholder Representative, provided
that the Stakeholder Representative's obligations pursuant to this Section 13
shall not exceed the amount of funds, if any, held pursuant to the Agent's
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior
lien upon any property, cash, or assets hereunder, with respect to its unpaid
fees and nonreimbursed expenses, superior to the interests of any other person.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off
and deduct any unpaid fees, nonreimbursed expenses and/or unsatisfied
indemnification rights from amounts on deposit in the Escrow Account.

     14. Termination. Upon delivery of all amounts constituting the Escrow Funds
as provided in Section 5 and the resolution of all disputes, if any, covered by
Section 9, this Agreement shall terminate except for the provisions of Section 9
(with respect to payment of the Escrow Agent's expenses), Section 10 and Section
13.

     15. Notices.

          15.1. All necessary notices, demands and requests required or

                                                             TO MERGER AGREEMENT

                         Definition of "Working Capital"
                   and Calculation of "Target Working Capital"

Pursuant to Section 2.9(a) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
December 14, 2005, by and among CorSolutions Medical, Inc., Matria Healthcare,
Inc. and Coral Acquisition Corp. (the "Agreement"), the following is the
definition of "Working Capital" and the calculation of the Target Working
Capital. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Exhibit D shall have
the same meaning as such terms do in the Agreement.

"Working Capital" means Current Assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, less
Current Liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as "Current Assets" and
"Current Liabilities" are defined in this Exhibit D. The calculation of Working
Capital shall be calculated without regard to Total Deferred Revenue as defined
in this Exhibit D. The calculation of Working Capital shall not give effect to
the Closing or any of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

Current Assets

Current Assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall consist of each of the
following line items, adjusted in each case to exclude the items set forth under
"Exclusions" below:

1. Accounts receivable--net; and

2. Prepaid and other current assets,

in the case of each of the line items set forth above, as determined in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Reference Balance
Sheet and the audited consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

Current Liabilities

Current Liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall consist of each of
the following line items, adjusted in each case to exclude the items set forth
under "Exclusions" below:

1. Accounts payable;

2. Accrued expenses;

3. Income tax payable; and

<PAGE>

4. To the extent determined by Parent, if determinable within forty-five (45)
days after the Closing Date at the time of the delivery by Parent of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and Preliminary Working Capital Amount, and agreed to by the
Stakeholder Representative, the amount of additional U.S. federal and state
income taxes payable for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 tax years related to the
correction of the software costs matter set forth in Section 3.11, paragraph 7
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

in the case of each of the line items set forth above, as determined in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Reference Balance
Sheet and the audited consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. Notwithstanding the
Company's proposed treatment in the December 31, 2005 balance sheet of severance
obligations to the Company's former CEO in the Company's (as set forth in
Section 3.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), for purposes of the
calculation of Current Liabilities in the Working Capital calculation, such item
shall be treated in a manner that is consistent with the treatment of such items
in the September 30, 2005 balance sheet.

Exclusions

Each of Current Assets and Current Liabilities shall expressly exclude each of
the following items, which shall not be taken into account in determining
Working Capital:

1. Cash and cash equivalents;

2. Deferred tax asset;

3. Indebtedness;

4. Company Transaction Expenses;

5. All "change of control," severance, retention, bonus and similar payments,
benefits, obligations and liabilities due to directors, officers, employees or
any other person or payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
directors, officers, employees or any other person, and any Tax Benefit relating
to such payments, benefits obligations and liabilities, in each case as a result
of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including, without
limitation, as a result of the termination of directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with, at or after the
Closing (whether pursuant to "single trigger" or "double trigger" provisions),
and any Tax Benefit relating to such payments, benefits and obligations;

6. Any amounts required to be paid to Ms. Gold or Mr. Cua pursuant to Section
3.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

7. Any other payment, obligation or liability that arises as a result of the
execution, delivery or performance of the Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
any of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the consummation of the
Merger; and

<PAGE>

8. Total Deferred Revenue. Total Deferred Revenue shall consist of all deferred
revenue line items, current portion and otherwise, as determined in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Reference Balance Sheet and the
audited consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

9. Any amounts payable to employees of the Company in lieu of Options granted or
promised to such employees as described in Section 3.4(d)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

10. Any loans made by the Company to employees in order to enable employees to
exercise some or all of their vested stock options. Such loans will be made only
on terms that provide that such loans will be repaid out of the Initial Merger
Consideration to be paid to such employees.

Target Working Capital

is calculated per the table below and is based on the Company's and its
