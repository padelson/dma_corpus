NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF ACQUIRED ASSETS

1.01 Purchase and Sale of Acquired Assets and Assumption of Assumed
Liabilities; Excluded Liabilities.

(a) Heritage Plastics. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Closing, (i) Heritage Plastics shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire
from Heritage Plastics, all of Heritage Plastic's right, title and interest in
and to, the Heritage Plastics Acquired Assets, in each case free and clear of
any and all Liens, in exchange for the payment of the applicable portion of
the Closing Payment to Heritage Plastics at the Closing pursuant to Section
1.02(a), and (ii) Buyer shall assume, and agree to pay, perform and discharge
when due, the Assumed Heritage Plastics Liabilities.

(b) Heritage Central. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Closing, (i) Heritage Central shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire
from Heritage Central, all of Heritage Central's right, title and interest in
and to, the Heritage Central Acquired Assets, in each case free and clear

the Closing Payment to Heritage Central at the Closing pursuant to Section
1.02(a), and (ii) Buyer shall assume, and agree to pay, perform and discharge
when due, the Assumed Heritage Central Liabilities.

(c) Heritage West. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Closing, (i) Heritage West shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire
from Heritage West, all of Heritage West's right, title and interest in and

Closing Payment to Heritage West at the Closing pursuant to Section 1.02(a),
and (ii) Buyer shall assume, and agree to pay, perform and discharge when due,
the Assumed Heritage West Liabilities.

(d) Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, except for the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer will not assume, or
otherwise be responsible for, any liabilities or obligations of the Companies,
whether actual or contingent, direct or indirect, matured or unmatured,
liquidated or unliquidated, or known or unknown, whether arising out of
occurrences prior to, at or after the date of this Agreement. The Companies
hereby acknowledge that the Companies are retaining the Excluded Liabilities,
and the Companies agree to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all of the
Excluded Liabilities promptly as and when due. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume or be
obligated to pay, perform or discharge any liabilities, obligations or
commitments of the Companies, Shareholders or any of their respective
Affiliates relating to or arising out of any of the Excluded Liabilities.

(e) Excluded Assets. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Excluded
Assets are being retained by the applicable Companies and Shareholders. Within
ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, except as to the furniture and
personal effects of Mr. Charles H. McCort, which shall be within ten (10)
Business Days after his termination of employment with Buyer, the Shareholders
shall, at their sole cost and expense, remove all Excluded Assets from the
facilities of the Companies without unreasonably interfering with the normal
operations of the business of the Companies or Buyer and shall repair, and
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, any damage or injury to the
premises or other Losses related to such removal. Such removal activities
shall be coordinated through the respective plant manager of such facilities.

1.02 Calculation of Closing Payments; Purchase Price. The purchase price for
the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Acquired Assets
and the other obligations of the Companies and Shareholders under this
Agreement shall be an amount equal to $89,450,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"),
subject to adjustment as provided herein (as so adjusted, the "Purchase
Price"). On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
Purchase Price shall be payable as provided in Sections 1.02(a), 1.02(b),
1.02(d)(iii) and 1.02(d)(iv) as follows:

(a) Closing Payment to the Companies. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to the
Companies in accordance with the Closing Payment Calculation Statement, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified in the
Closing Payment Calculation Statement, an aggregate amount (the "Closing
Payment") equal to: 

(i) the Base Purchase Price;

(ii) minus the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the Closing;

(iii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital
exceeds the Working Capital Target;

(iv) minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is
less than the Working Capital Target; and

(v) minus the Escrow Amount.

For purposes of Sections 1.02(a) and 1.02(b), as applicable, the amount of
outstanding Indebtedness and Estimated Net Working Capital shall be as set
forth in the Closing Payment Calculation Statement as provided herein.

(b) Other Payments at Closing.

(i) Payment of Indebtedness. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay on behalf of the
Companies all Indebtedness set forth in the Closing Payment Calculation
Statement by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with,
and to the accounts specified pursuant to, the Payoff Letters and the Closing
Payment Calculation Statement.

(ii) Deposit of Escrow Amount. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the Escrow Amount to an account to be
maintained pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held
and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Closing Payment Calculation Statement. Prior to the Closing, the Companies
and the Seller Representative shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a correct and
complete statement, in a form satisfactory to Buyer (the "Closing Payment
Calculation Statement"), setting forth (i) the aggregate amount of the
outstanding Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, together with pay-off letters
(the "Payoff Letters"), in a form satisfactory to Buyer, from each Person to
which any Indebtedness is owed (the "Company Creditors"), which shall indicate
that the applicable Company Creditor has agreed to unconditionally release all
Liens in respect of such Indebtedness relating to the Companies and their
respective assets and properties upon receipt of the amounts indicated in such
Payoff Letters, (ii) a good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital as of
the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Working Capital") set forth in reasonable
detail, (iii) the Applicable Percentage and a calculation of the actual amount
of the Closing Payment payable to each Company at Closing and (iv) the wire
instructions for the payment of all amounts reflected in the Closing Payment
Calculation Statement. The Estimated Net Working Capital shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied in the manner used for the Audited
Financial Statements, subject to the exceptions and procedures set forth on
Schedule 1.02(c) (the "Accounting Principles"). Buyer shall have the right to
review the Closing Payment Calculation Statement and object thereto, and the
Companies and the Seller Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall 

cooperate in good faith to resolve any such objections prior to the Closing
and update the Closing Payment Calculation Statement accordingly.

(d) Post-Closing Adjustment.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the Seller Representative a
statement (the "Closing Statement") containing (A) an unaudited statement of
the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Net Working
Capital") and (B) a calculation of the adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 1.02(d) (the "Post-Closing Adjustment"), in each case
of clauses (A), and (B) prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
The Companies will cooperate with Buyer, and provide Buyer access to the
facilities of the Companies, for purposes of conducting a physical inventory
count prior to the Closing.

(ii) If the Seller Representative has any good faith objections to the Closing
Statement (or any element thereof), the Seller Representative shall deliver to
Buyer a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "Objections
Statement"), which statement shall identify in reasonable detail those items
and amounts included in the Closing Statement to which the Seller
Representative objects (the "Disputed Items"). If an Objections Statement is
not delivered to Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Closing Statement as prepared by Buyer (or any element thereof
to which the Seller Representative shall not have objected in a timely
Objections Statement) shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the
parties hereto. If an Objections Statement is timely provided, Buyer and the
Seller Representative, in conjunction with their respective independent
accounting firms, shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
twenty (20) Business Days from the date of the Objections Statement (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree in writing) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the Closing Statement or any component thereof.
If the parties do not reach a final resolution within such period, the Seller
Representative and Buyer may engage Crowe Horwath LLP or another an
independent national accounting firm mutually selected by Buyer and the Seller
Representative (the accounting firm specified or otherwise agreed upon, the
"Accounting Firm") to resolve any remaining Disputed Items. The Seller
Representative and Buyer shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon as
practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days after its engagement. The
Accounting Firm shall determine, only with respect to the Disputed Items
submitted to the Accounting Firm, whether the Closing Statement or any
component thereof was prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in
this Agreement and, only with respect to the Disputed Items submitted to the
Accounting Firm, whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Statement or
any component thereof requires adjustment. The Seller Representative and Buyer
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to promptly deliver to Buyer and the Seller Representative its
determination in writing, which determination shall be made subject to the
definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement, and shall be (i)
consistent with either the position of the Seller Representative or Buyer or
(ii) between the positions of the Seller Representative and Buyer. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and conclusive
for purposes of this Agreement, and judgment may be entered thereon in a court
of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with the 

resolution of such dispute by the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Companies, on the other hand, as determined by the Accounting Firm based on
the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Firm's determination (before
such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to it. For purposes of illustration only, if there were
an aggregate of $100 of items in dispute and if the final written
determination of the Accounting Firm states that $80 of such items are in
accordance with the Seller Representative's position and $20 of such items are
in accordance with Buyer's position, the Companies would bear 20% of the
Accounting Firm's costs and expenses, on the one hand, and Buyer would bear
80% of such costs and expenses, on the other hand. The date on which the
Closing Statement is finally determined in accordance with this Section
1.02(d)(ii) or as mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and the Seller
Representative is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date."

(iii) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Determination Date, the absolute
value of the amount by which the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally
determined in accordance with Section 1.02(d)(ii)) is less than or greater
than the Estimated Net Working Capital, plus accrued interest as provided
herein, shall (A) be paid in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds by Buyer to the Seller Representative on behalf of the Companies (if
such Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Net
Working Capital), or (B) paid in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by the Companies, jointly and severally, to Buyer (if such
Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital).

(iv) The amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.02(d)(iii) shall accrue simple
interest on the unpaid balance from and after the Closing Date until such
balance is paid in full (but no interest shall be payable for the day on which
such payment is made) at a per annum rate equal to "prime rate" as of the
Closing Date as published in the Wall Street Journal.

(v) All payments required pursuant to Section 1.02(d)(iii) shall be deemed to
be adjustments to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes.

1.03 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Mayer Brown LLP,
at 71 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois, at 10:00 a.m. (Central Time) on
the fifth (5th) Business Day following the day upon which all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Articles II have been satisfied or waived
as provided herein (other than those conditions that by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver
as provided herein of such conditions) or such other date as is mutually
agreed upon in writing by Buyer and the Seller Representative. The Closing
shall be deemed to have taken place at, and shall be effective as of, 11:50
p.m. (local time in each applicable time zone where the premises subject to
the Facilities Leases are located) on the Closing Date. If the Closing occurs,
all transactions and deliveries required to be made or completed at the
Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to occur
concurrently unless otherwise expressly agreed by Buyer and the Seller
Representative to the contrary.

1.04 Tax Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payments under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax 

Law (the "Applicable Tax Withholding"). To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body, Buyer shall be treated as
having paid such withheld amounts to the Person(s) entitled thereto pursuant
to this Agreement.

1.05 Allocation and Payment.

(a) Set forth on Schedule 1.05(a) is a preliminary allocation of the Base
Purchase Price among the Companies. The Closing Payment shall be allocated
among the Companies and paid in accordance with such Company's applicable
percentage as set forth on Schedule 1.05(a) (the "Applicable Percentage"). Any
adjustments to the Purchase Price and disbursements under the Escrow Agreement
paid to the Seller Representative shall be allocated among the Companies as
determined by the Seller Representative. All payments made to the Seller
Representative hereunder shall be for the benefit of the applicable Company to
whom such payments are allocated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and shall be paid by the Seller Representative promptly (but in any
event within two (2) Business Days) after receipt of such payment by the
Seller Representative to the applicable Company. All payments made to the
Seller Representative shall be deemed made to the Companies as between Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Companies, the Seller Representative and the
Shareholders, on the other hand, and Buyer shall have no responsibility or
liability as a result of the failure of the Seller Representative to pay any
such amount to any Company or Shareholder or the allocation of such payments
among such Persons.

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller Representative a schedule allocating the Purchase Price and any other
amounts treated as consideration for applicable Tax purposes among the assets
of each Company in accordance with section 1060 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder (the "Allocation Schedule"). Buyer shall consider in
good faith such reasonable comments to the Allocation Schedule as are provided
in writing by the Seller Representative to Buyer within ten (10) days after
receipt of the Allocation Schedule. The Allocation Schedule shall be final and
binding on the parties. The parties agree not to take any position
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule for Tax reporting purposes. Any
adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be allocated as provided by Treasury
Regulations section 1.1060-1(c).

1.06 Assignability and Consents. Nothing in this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be construed as an
attempt or agreement to assign any Acquired Asset that by its terms or by Law
is non-assignable without the consent of a third party (including any
Governmental Body) or is cancelable by a third party in the event of an
assignment (a "Non-Assignable Asset"), unless and until consent from such
third party shall have been obtained. With respect to all Non-Assignable
Assets, the Shareholders and Companies shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer at its request following the
Closing Date in endeavoring to obtain such consents. Subject to the foregoing,
Buyer, Shareholders and the Companies shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any consent,
substitution, approval or amendment required under the Assumed Contracts. To
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable
Assets, in the event that consents to the assignment thereof cannot be
obtained, such Non-Assignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing
Date, by the 

Companies for the benefit and detriment of Buyer, and the covenants and

Seller Representative shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
a supplement to the disclosure schedule specifying such change(s) (each such
supplement, a "Schedule Supplement"). No information or Schedule Supplement
provided to Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be deemed to cure any

(j) Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall create any third-party beneficiary
right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, including any

benefit plan or program or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right
to continued employment with the Companies, Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

writing by Buyer the authority to draw upon or have access to such accounts

(c) From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, except with respect to
breaches of covenants or agreements requiring performance by, or binding upon,
any of the Companies or Shareholders following the Closing in Section 8.13,
the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the full amount of

being understood and agreed that the right to recover such Losses shall
survive forever. 

8.06 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or warranty
shall terminate on the applicable survival termination date (as set forth in
Section 8.01), unless an Indemnified Person shall have made a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.07, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Article VIII, prior to such termination date, as applicable, by
delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis for any
such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon
which such claim for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Person. If
an Indemnified Person has made a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.07 prior to such termination date, then such claim, if then unresolved,
shall not be extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set forth in Section
8.01, but shall remain in effect until fully resolved.

8.07 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(b) Claims. As soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a claim (or the
commencement of any suit, action or proceeding) of the type described in
Section 8.07(b) or Section 8.10(e), the Indemnified Person shall give notice
to the Indemnifying Person of such claim; provided, that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of
its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent (if any) that the
Indemnifying Person shall have been actually prejudiced thereby. If the
Indemnifying Person does not object in writing to such indemnification claim
within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving notice thereof, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover promptly from the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnifying Person shall promptly pay to the Indemnified
Person the amount of such claim (but such recovery shall not limit the amount
of any additional indemnification to which the Indemnified Person may be
entitled pursuant to Section 8.02, 8.03, or 8.04), and no later objection by
the Indemnifying Person shall be permitted. If within such thirty (30) day
period the Indemnifying Person agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation but objects that it is obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the
Indemnified Person shall nevertheless be entitled to recover from the
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnifying Person shall promptly pay to the
Indemnified Person the lesser amount, without prejudice to the Indemnified
Person's claim for the difference.

(c) Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense. The Indemnified
Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the
Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any claim (or the commencement of any
suit, action or proceeding) by any unaffiliated Person not a party hereto
(other than by a Governmental Body with respect to Taxes, which shall be
governed by Section 8.10(e)) in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
this Agreement; provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Person to give
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this
Article VIII except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall
have been actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own
expense, (i) participate in the defense of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding and (ii) upon notice to the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person's delivering to the Indemnified Person a written agreement that the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02,
8.03 or 8.04 for all Losses arising out of such claim, suit, action or
proceeding and that the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the entire
amount of any Loss resulting therefrom, at any time during the course of any
such claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof; 

provided, that (a) the Indemnifying Person shall provide written evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person demonstrating that the
Indemnifying Person has a sufficient amount of financial resources to
vigorously defend such matter, (b) the Indemnifying Person's counsel is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and (c) the Indemnifying
Person shall thereafter consult with the Indemnified Person upon the
Indemnified Person's reasonable request for such consultation from time to
time with respect to such claim, suit, action or proceeding; provided,
further, that the Indemnifying Person shall not have the right to assume the
defense of any claim, suit, action or proceeding involving criminal liability
or in which any relief other than monetary damages is sought against the
Indemnified Person or that could otherwise have an adverse impact on the
Buyer, its Affiliates or their businesses. If the Indemnifying Person assumes
such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the duty)
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person. If,
however, the Indemnified Person reasonably determines in its judgment that
representation by the Indemnifying Person's counsel of both the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnified Person would present such counsel with a conflict
of interest, then such Indemnified Person may employ separate counsel to
represent or defend it in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding and the
Indemnifying Person shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate
counsel. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute
any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

(d) Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made or caused to
be made by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person, as the case may
be, of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in
Section 8.07(b) shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or the
Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final
judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the amount of such settlement or compromise; provided, that (i) no obligation,
restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of
such settlement without its prior written consent and the Indemnifying Person
shall demonstrate that it has the financial resources to perform its

10.05 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors, assigns, heirs and
legal representatives; provided, that no assignment of any rights or
obligations hereunder shall be made by any Shareholder or the Companies
without the written consent of Buyer and no assignment of any rights or
obligations hereunder shall be made by Buyer to any Person, other than to an
Affiliate of Buyer, without the written consent of the Seller Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign this Agreement to one or more
Affiliates of Buyer or to any lender to Buyer or its Affiliates as security
for obligations to such lender in respect of any financing arrangements
entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and any
refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals thereof; provided, that no
assignment to any such Affiliate or lender shall in any way affect Buyer's
obligations under this Agreement.

10.06 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of the
other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be
deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable
provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

10.07 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented but only in writing signed by Buyer and the Seller
Representative. The failure of a party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or 

continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other instances or a
waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term, covenant,
representation or warranty.

10.08 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreements, Ancillary Documents, disclosure
schedules and Exhibits) contain the complete agreement between the parties
hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations
by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the
subject matter hereof in any way.

10.09 Joint Drafting. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

10.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature page
delivered via facsimile or electronic transmission (e.g., PDF file) shall be
binding to the same extent as an original signature page. Any party who
delivers such a signature page agrees to later deliver an original counterpart
to any party that requests it.

10.11 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

10.12 Jurisdiction of Disputes; Waiver of Jury Trial. In the event any party
to this Agreement commences any litigation, proceeding or other legal action
in connection with or relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or
any matters described or contemplated herein or therein, the parties to this
Agreement hereby (i) agree that any such litigation, proceeding or other legal
action shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction
located within the City of Wilmington, Delaware, whether a state or federal
court; (ii) agree that in connection with any such litigation, proceeding or
action, such parties will consent and submit to personal jurisdiction in any
such court described in clause (i) above and to service of process upon them
in accordance with the rules and statutes governing service of process; (iii)
agree to waive to the full extent permitted by law any objection that they may
now or hereafter have to the venue of any such litigation, proceeding or
action in any such court or that any such litigation, proceeding or action was
brought in an inconvenient forum; (iv) designate, appoint and direct CT
Corporation System as their authorized agent to receive on their behalf
service of any and all process and documents in any legal proceeding in the
State of Delaware; (v) agree to notify the other parties to this Agreement
immediately if such agent shall refuse to act, or be prevented from acting, as
agent and, in such event, promptly to designate another agent in the State of
Delaware to serve in place of such agent and deliver to the other parties
written evidence of such substitute agent's acceptance of such designation;
(vi) agree as an alternative method of service to service of process in any
litigation, proceeding or action by mailing of copies thereof to the parties
at their addresses set forth in Section 10.04; (vii) agree that any service
made as provided herein shall be effective and binding service in every
respect; and (viii) agree that nothing herein shall affect the rights of any
party to effect 

service of process in any other manner permitted by Law. EACH PARTY WAIVES THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS DESCRIBED OR CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN OR THEREIN, AND AGREES TO TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTION NECESSARY OR
APPROPRIATE TO EFFECT SUCH WAIVER.

10.13 No Third Party Beneficiaries. No Person other than the parties hereto
shall have any rights, remedies, obligations or benefits under any provision
of this Agreement, other than Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.04 (to the extent
provided therein).

10.14 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement shall govern and control.

10.15 Remedies Cumulative. The remedies provided in this Agreement shall be
cumulative and shall not preclude the assertion or exercise of any other
rights or remedies available by Law, in equity or otherwise.

10.16 Effect of Investigation. Any due diligence review, audit or other
investigation or inquiry undertaken or performed by or on behalf of Buyer
shall not limit, qualify, modify or amend the representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations of (including indemnities by) any Seller or the
Companies made in or undertaken pursuant to this Agreement or any of their
Ancillary Documents, irrespective of the knowledge and information received
(or which should have been received) therefrom by Buyer.
