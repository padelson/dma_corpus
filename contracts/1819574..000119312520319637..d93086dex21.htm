AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION is made and entered into as of
December 16, 2020 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among Northern Star
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), NSAC Merger Sub
Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ "), and Barkbox, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Company_ "). The term
" _Agreement_ " as used herein refers to this Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, as the same may be amended from time to time, and all
schedules hereto (including the Company Schedule and the Parent Schedule, as
defined in the preambles to _ Articles II_ and _ III_ hereof, respectively).
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall be referred to herein,
individually, as a " _Party_ " and, collectively, as the " _Parties_ ".
Except as otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

RECITALS

 

A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), the
Parties intend to enter into a business combination transaction by which
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (with the Company being the
surviving entity of the Merger (" _Surviving Corporation_ ")) in exchange for
the Companys stockholders receiving shares of Class A common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") as provided by
this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ").

B. The boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, their
respective companies and their respective stockholders.

C. The parties intend that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is hereby adopted as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

 

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
Surviving Corporation after the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. 

1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (defined
below), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing, or such later time as may be
agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, being the " _Effective Time_ "). Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the consummation of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ "), other than the filing of the Certificate of
Merger, shall take place at the offices of Graubard Miller, counsel to
Parent, The Chrysler Building, 405 Lexington Avenue, 11 _th_ Floor, New York,
New York 10174-1901 at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the third (3 _rd_ ) Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _ Article VI_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction thereof at the Closing), or at
such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the
" _Closing Date_ "). Closing signatures may be transmitted by facsimile or by
email pdf files.

 



1

    

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.4 _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time,

 

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be that of
the Company; and

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to
be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be that of the Company.

 

1.5 _Effect on Securities_.

 

(a) [ _Reserved_ ].

(b)  _Conversion of Securities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and this Agreement
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(i) other than shares cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(e)_ and
Dissenting Shares, each share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock (collectively, " _Company Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any conversion or exchange of Company Convertible Notes pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.10(c)_) will be automatically converted into the right to receive that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Merger Shares_ ") equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ") consistent with _
Schedule 1.5(b)_ hereto, which sets forth a calculation of the Exchange Ratio
as of the Agreement Date, together with the assumptions related to such
calculation; and

(ii) each share of Merger Subs common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Per Share Merger Consideration
issuable pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 1.5_ shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock), extraordinary cash
dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock occurring on or after the Agreement Date but at or prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the Merger, and each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock any time shares of Parent Common Stock are distributed to any
such Person pursuant to this Agreement (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder
in connection with such distribution) shall, upon compliance with _ Section_
__ _ 1.6,_ receive from Parent, in lieu of such fractional share, one (1)
share of Parent Common Stock.

(e) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company
Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

 



2

    

1.6 _Merger Consideration_ __ _ Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. At the Closing, the holders of Company Stock (the "
_Company Stockholders_ ") shall deliver the certificates or notes evidencing
their right to shares of Company Stock (including Company Convertible Notes
that have been converted into Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.10(c)_) (the " _Company Certificates_ ") to Parent for cancellation, or in
the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, will deliver to
Parent an affidavit (and indemnity if required) in the manner provided in _
Section_ __ _ 1.7_ below), together with a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and the
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper transfer of each share to
an exchange agent, who shall be mutually determined by the Company and Parent
(and who may be either the Company or Parent), and which letter of transmittal
will be in customary form) (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and receive in
exchange therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration in book-entry form
(unless certificates representing Merger Shares are otherwise requested by
Company Stockholders) and the certificates representing the Company Stock
shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Company
Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as prescribed by
this Agreement.

 

(b) _Distributions With Respect to_ __ _ Unexchanged_ __ _ Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Agreement Date
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Company Certificates
with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration to be issued upon
surrender thereof until the holders of record of such Company Certificates
shall surrender such certificates. Subject to applicable law, following
surrender of any such Company Certificates, Parent shall promptly deliver to
the record holders thereof, without interest, the Per Share Merger
Consideration issued in exchange therefor in book-entry form and the amount of
any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Merger Shares.

(c) _Transfers of Ownership_. If Merger Shares are to be issued in book-entry
form in a name other than that in which the Company Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Company Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting
such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of Merger Shares
representing the Per Share Merger Consideration in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Company Certificates surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) _Required Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
(or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. Parent shall provide notice of any
withholding that it intends to make (or cause to be made) in connection with
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
(other than any withholding required in connection with amounts properly
treated as compensation for applicable Tax purposes) at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the date of the relevant payment, and the Parties shall (and
shall cause their Affiliates to) cooperate to minimize or eliminate any
potential withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld
consistent with the terms of this _ Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Stock and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _
Article I_.

 



3

    

1.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Stock formerly represented by such Company Certificates was converted into and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_;
provided, however, that, as a condition precedent to the delivery of such Per
Share Merger Consideration, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Certificates shall indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made
against Parent or Surviving Corporation with respect to the Company
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and deliver any
Letter of Transmittal reasonably required by Parent.

 

1.8 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368-3(a).

1.9 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the
Company and Merger Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to take all such
lawful and necessary action.

 

1.10 _Outstanding Company Derivative Securities_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock, whether or not exercisable and
whether or not vested, immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company
Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (such option, an " _Exchanged
Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at
an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
(A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that
the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Exchanged Options shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; provided, further, that in
the case of any Exchanged Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and the U.S. Department of Treasury
regulations thereunder, as applicable. Except as specifically provided above,
following the Effective Time, each Exchanged Option shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and
exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the adjustments
required by this _Section_ __ _ 1.10(a)_ after giving effect to the Merger.
At the Effective Time, each Company restricted stock award (a " _Company
Restricted Stock Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by
Parent and shall be converted into a restricted stock award with respect to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (such restricted stock award, an "
_Exchanged RSA_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Exchange Ratio, with the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plan (the " _Assumed Plan_ ") such
that the Exchanged Options and Exchanged RSAs will be issued under the
Assumed Plan, and stock options and other equity-based awards may be issued
with respect to the shares available for grant thereunder as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (subject to appropriate adjustment pursuant to the
Company Stock Plan and all equity-based awards granted thereunder) in respect
of Parent Common Stock under such Company Stock Plan, and Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options
and the issuance of stock options and other equity-based awards from the
shares available for grant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time under
the Company Stock Plan assumed in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
1.10(a)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parties and their boards, as

lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to

of such Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Complete and
correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other
comparable governing instruments with different names) (collectively referred

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As of the Agreement Date, each
jurisdiction in which the Company is so qualified or licensed is listed in _
Schedule 2.1(b)_.

its business as it is now being conducted. Each Subsidiary is in possession of
all Approvals necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports

on the Company. Complete and correct copies of the Charter Documents of each
Subsidiary, as amended and currently in effect, have been heretofore delivered
to Parent or Parents counsel.

 

(c) Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
limited liability company and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature

Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally or by principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies. To the Companys knowledge, no other
party to a Material Company Contract is the subject of a bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding. True, correct and complete copies of all Material

Subsidiary party thereto nor, to the Companys knowledge, any other party

no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a breach of or default under, any Material Company Contract, and no party to
any Material Company Contract has given any written notice of any claim of any
such breach, default or event, in each case, which breach, default or
event, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Companys and its Subsidiaries business and operations, including any
insurance required to be maintained by Material Company Contracts.

 

2.21 _Governmental Actions/Filings_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have been granted and hold, and have

Company and its Subsidiaries of their businesses (as presently conducted) or
used or held for use by the Company and its Subsidiaries, except for any of
the foregoing that if not granted, held or made would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in substantial
compliance in all material respects with all of their obligations with respect
to such Governmental Actions/Filings. To the knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred and is continuing which requires or permits, or after
notice or lapse of time or both would require or permit, and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any ancillary documents
will not require or permit (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), any modification or termination of any such Governmental
Actions/Filings except such events which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



19

    

(b) To the knowledge of the Company, no Governmental Action/Filing is
necessary to be obtained, secured or made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enable any of them to continue to conduct its businesses and
operations and use its properties after the Closing in a manner which is
substantially consistent in all material respects with current practice.

guarantee credit) to any of such Persons, other than (i) for payment of salary
for services rendered, (ii) reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) for other employee

other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally
and by general principles of equity.

Merger Subs Charter Documents, (ii) conflict with or violate any Legal
Requirements, (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under,

provision of any Parent Contracts, except, with respect to clauses (ii), (iii)
and (iv), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
impairments, alterations, triggerings, accelerations, increases or other
occurrences that would not, individually and in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub.

 



23

    

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do

requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and appropriate
documents received from or filed with the relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which Parent is qualified to do business, (ii) for the filing

approval of the Parent Stockholders in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.1_, (v) for the filing of the Certificate of Merger, and (vi) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to

aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent or Merger Sub, or (y) prevent the consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing their material
obligations under this Agreement on a timely basis.

3.6 _Compliance_. During the Lookback Period, each of Parent and Merger Sub
has complied with all, and is not in violation of any, Legal Requirements
with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of

or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub. During the Lookback
Period, the businesses and activities of Parent and Merger Sub have not been
and are not being conducted in violation of any Legal Requirements, except
for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
or Merger Sub. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in default or violation in any
material respect of any term, condition or provision of any applicable
Charter Documents. Except as set forth in _ Schedule_ __ _ 3.6_, during the
Lookback Period, no written notice of non-compliance with any Legal

knowledge of any such notice delivered to any other Person).

 

3.7 _Parent SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Parent has timely filed all required registration statements, reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by Parent with the SEC
since its formation (collectively, as they have been amended since the time of
their filing and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Parent SEC Reports_
"). None of the Parent SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Agreement Date or the Closing
Date, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited
financial statements of Parent (" _Parent Audited Financial Statements_ ") and
unaudited interim financial statements of Parent (" _Parent Unaudited
Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Parent Audited Financial
Statements, the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") (including, in each case,
the notes and schedules thereto) included in the Parent SEC Reports complied
as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
applied on a consistent basis in accordance with past practice during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto
and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) and fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements included therein, to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of complete footnotes) in all material respects the financial
position of Parent and Merger Sub as of the respective dates thereof and the
results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods then
ended. Parent has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are not disclosed in
the Parent SEC Reports.

(b) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent is made known to Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. To
Parents knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Parents principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in Parents periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.

 



24

    

(c) Parent has established and maintained a system of internal controls. To
Parents knowledge, such internal controls are effective and sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of the Parents financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Parent to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) or director of Parent. Parent has not taken any action prohibited by

the Agreement Date.

and notes receivable of Parent and Merger Sub reflected in the Parent
Financial Statements: (i) to Parents knowledge, are legal, valid and binding
obligations of the respective debtors enforceable in accordance with their
terms, except as such may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally,
and by general equitable principles, (ii) to Parents knowledge, are not
subject to any valid set-off or counterclaim to which Parent has been
notified in writing as of the Agreement Date except to the extent set forth in
such balance sheet contained therein, and (iii) are not the subject of any
actions or proceedings brought by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub as of
the Agreement Date.

3.8 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in _ Schedule_ __ _
3.8_ hereto, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any liabilities (absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a
balance sheet or in the related notes to the Parent Financial Statements that
are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of
operations or financial condition of Parent or Merger Sub, except: (i)
liabilities provided for in or otherwise disclosed in the balance sheet
included in the most recent Parent Financial Statements or in the notes to
the most recent Parent Financial Statements, and (ii) such liabilities arising
in the ordinary course of Parents or Merger Subs business since the date of
the most recent Parent Financial Statement, none of which, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and
Merger Sub, taken as a whole.

 

3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, since the date of the most recent Parent Financial Statement until
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there has not been: (i) any
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) any declaration, setting
aside or payment of any dividend on, or other distribution (whether in cash,
stock or property) in respect of, any of Parents capital stock, or any
purchase, redemption or other acquisition by Parent of any of Parents capital
stock or any other securities of Parent or any options, warrants, calls or
rights to acquire any such shares or other securities, (iii) any split,
combination or reclassification of any of Parents capital stock, (iv) any
granting by Parent of any increase in compensation or fringe benefits, or any
payment by Parent of any bonus, or any granting by Parent of any increase in
severance or termination pay or any entry by Parent into any currently
effective employment, severance, termination or indemnification agreement or
any agreement the benefits of which are contingent or the terms of which are
materially altered upon the occurrence of a transaction involving Parent of
the nature contemplated hereby, (v) entry by Parent into any licensing or
other agreement with regard to the acquisition or disposition of any material
Intellectual Property other than licenses and services agreements in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or any amendment or
consent with respect to any licensing or services agreement, (vi) any
material change by Parent or Merger Sub in its accounting methods, principles
or practices, except as required by concurrent changes in U.S. GAAP, (vii) any
change in the auditors of Parent, or (viii) any material revaluation by
Parent or Merger Sub of any of its assets, including, without limitation,
writing down the value of capitalized inventory or writing off notes or
accounts receivable or any sale of assets of Parent or Merger Sub.

 

3.10 _Litigation_. There are no, and have never been any, claims, suits,
actions or proceedings pending or to Parents knowledge, threatened in
writing against either Parent or Merger Sub, before any court, governmental
department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or any
arbitrator.

 

3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub maintains, and
has no liability under, any Plan, and neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, bonus, or otherwise) becoming due to any
stockholder, director, or employee of Parent or Merger Sub, or (ii) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

 



25

    

3.12 _Labor Matters_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to
persons employed by Parent or Merger Sub and neither Parent nor Merger Sub
knows of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such
employees.

 

3.13 _Business Activities_. Since its organization, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has conducted any business activities other than activities directed
toward the accomplishment of a business combination. Merger Sub was created
for the purpose of facilitating the Merger and has not conducted any prior
business activities, other than any such activities incidental to
consummating the Merger. Except as set forth in the Parent Charter Documents,
there is no agreement, commitment, exclusive license, judgment, injunction,
order, or decree binding upon Parent or Merger Sub or to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party which has or would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of Parent
or Merger Sub, any acquisition of property by Parent or Merger Sub, or the
conduct of business by Parent or Merger Sub.

 

3.14 _Title to Property_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns or leases any
real property or personal property. Except as set forth in  _Schedule 3.14_ ,
as of the Agreement Date there are no options or other contracts under which

3.24 _Trust Fund_. As of the Agreement Date and immediately prior to the
Closing, Parent has and will have no less than $254,350,000 invested in
United States Government securities or money market funds meeting the
conditions under Rule 2a-7(d) promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, in a trust account administered by Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ ", and such trust account, the "
_Trust Fund_ "), less such amounts, if any, as (i) Parent is required to pay
to Redeeming Stockholders and (ii) Parent has paid under _Section_ __ _
1.11(b)_ out of the Trust Fund). Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held
in the Trust Fund may be released except in accordance with that
certain Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2020
(the " _Trust Agreement_ "), by and between Parent and Continental, Parents
Charter Documents and the Final Prospectus. Parent has performed all
material obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and is not
in material default, breach or delinquent in performance or any other respect
(claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no event has
occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
such a default or breach thereunder. There are no claims or proceedings
pending with respect to the Trust Fund. Since November 10, 2020 through the
Agreement Date, Parent has not released any money from the Trust Fund (other
than interest income earned on the principal held in the Trust Fund as

effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and
other similar Laws affecting the enforceability of creditors rights
generally, general equitable principles and the discretion of courts in
granting equitable remedies. As of the Effective Time, upon approval of the
Stockholder Matters, the obligations of Parent to dissolve or liquidate
pursuant to Parents Charter Documents shall terminate, and as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to
Parents Charter Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of Parent by
reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Following
the Effective Time, no Parent Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any
amount from the Trust Fund except to the extent such Parent Stockholder is a
Redeeming Stockholder. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained herein and the compliance by the
Company with its obligations hereunder, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust
Fund will not be satisfied or that funds available in the Trust Fund will not
be available to Parent and Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub has any legally binding agreement, arrangement or understanding to
enter into or incur, any obligations with respect to or under any indebtedness
other than Parent Borrowings in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein.

 



28

    

3.25 _PIPE Documents_. The PIPE Documents are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party
thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each such
other party in accordance with their respective terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws now
or hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity) and the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought, and are in full force and effect. No
event or circumstance has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could constitute a default on the part of Parent or, to
the knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties thereto under any of the
PIPE Documents, and Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to believe that
Parent will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
closing to be satisfied by Parent contained in any of the PIPE Documents.
None of the PIPE Documents have been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect (and no such amendment or
modification is contemplated), and Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to
believe that any portion of the PIPE Investment contemplated by any of the
PIPE Documents will not be available as of the Closing. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amounts of the PIPE Investment, other than as set forth in the PIPE
Documents. There are no agreements, side letters, contracts or arrangements to
which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates is a party relating to
the PIPE Documents or the PIPE Investment that have not been entirely
superseded by the PIPE Documents. Parent has made available to the Company
true, correct and complete copies of the executed PIPE Documents.

 

3.26 _No Additional Representations and Warranties; Independent
Investigation_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Article III_
(as modified by the Parent Schedule) and in any Ancillary Agreement, neither
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates, nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners, members
or representatives has made, or is making, any other express or implied
representation or warranty whatsoever with respect to Parent, Merger Sub,
their respective Affiliates, and any matter relating to any of them, including

or completeness of any other information made available to the Company, its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives by, or on behalf of,
Parent or Merger Sub, and any such representations or warranties are expressly
disclaimed. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a sophisticated purchaser and has
made its own independent investigation, review and analysis regarding the
Company and any Subsidiary and the transactions contemplated herein, which
investigation, review and analysis were conducted by Parent and Merger Sub
together with expert advisors, including legal counsel, that they
have engaged for such purpose. Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives
have been provided with full and complete access to the representatives,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the
Company and any Subsidiary and other information that they have requested in
connection with their investigation of the Company and its Subsidiary and the
transactions contemplated herein. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is relying on
any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or
implied, made by the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
representatives, except as expressly set forth in _Article II_ (as modified by
the Company Schedule) and in any Ancillary Agreement.

 

3.27 _Independent Investigation; No Reliance_. Parent and Merger Sub have
conducted their own independent investigation, verification, review and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, technology and prospects of the Company,
which investigation, review and analysis was conducted by Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates and, to the extent deemed appropriate by
them, by representatives of Parent or Merger Sub. In entering into this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that it has relied
solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article
II_ of this Agreement and in any Ancillary Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub

32

    

(b) _Access to Information_.

 

(i) Subject to confidentiality obligations that may be applicable to
information furnished to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by third
parties that may be in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries possession
from time to time, and except for any information which in the opinion of
legal counsel of the Company would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege or other privilege from disclosure, the Company will afford Parent
and its financial advisors, accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, in
such manner as to not interfere with the normal operation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the properties, books, records and management personnel
of the Company during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all
information concerning the business, including the status of business
development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company, as Parent may reasonably request; provided, that such access shall
not include any invasive or intrusive investigations or other testing,
sampling or analysis of any properties, facilities or equipment of the Company
or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company;
provided, further that any such access shall be subject to and limited to
the extent the Company reasonably determines in good faith, in light of the
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (taking into account any "shelter-in-place"
or similar order issued by a Governmental Entity), that such access would
jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
make alternative arrangements for such disclosure where the restrictions in
the preceding sentence apply. No information or knowledge obtained by Parent

such manner as to not interfere with the normal operation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the properties, books, records and personnel of Parent
and Merger Sub during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all
information concerning the business, including properties, results of
operations and personnel of Parent and Merger Sub, as the Company may
reasonably request; provided, that any such access shall be subject to and
limited to the extent that Parent reasonably determines in good faith, in
light of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (taking into account any
"shelter-in-place" or similar order issued by a Governmental Entity), that
such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of Parent
or Merger Sub. The parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
make alternative arrangements for such disclosure where the restrictions in
the preceding sentence apply. No information or knowledge obtained by the
Company in any investigation pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(ii)_
will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained

any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by

waivers from third parties required as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including, unless otherwise

Meeting (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that Parent has determined in good faith is required to
satisfy the conditions of _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_ below or any
other applicable Legal Requirement or (ii) if on a date for which the Special
Meeting is scheduled, Parent reasonably determines that the Merger cannot be
consummated for any reason; provided, that Parent continues to satisfy its
obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_ below and Parent shall reconvene
such Special Meeting as promptly as practicable following such time as the
matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) have been resolved.

to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
(provided that Parent shall not be responsible for the accuracy or
completeness of any information relating to the Company or any other

information relating to Parent or any other information furnished by Parent
in writing specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus). No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will

Statement/Prospectus the recommendation of its board of directors that the
Parent Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger and the other matters referred to in _ Section_ __ _
5.1(a)_, and shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to obtain approval of
the matters referred to in _ Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)_. Neither Parents board
of directors nor any committee or agent or representative thereof shall
withdraw, proposed to withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to the Company,
the Parent board of directors recommendation that the Parent Stockholders
vote in favor of the adoption of any of the Stockholder Matters. No amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent without
the written approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed, and Parent shall promptly transmit any such
amendment or supplement to the Parent Stockholders, if at any time prior to
the Special Meeting there shall be discovered any information that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(a) In connection with the preparation of the Parent Signing Form 8-K, the
Signing Press Release, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Closing Form 8-K,
the Closing Press Release or any other statement, filing, notice, or
application (other than pursuant to the HSR Act, for which _ Section_ __ _
5.3_ applies) made by or on behalf of Parent or the Company to any
Governmental Entity or other third party in connection with Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (each, a " _Reviewable Document_ "),
and for such other reasonable purposes, each of the Company and Parent shall,
upon request by the other, use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to
applicable law and contractual restrictions) to furnish the other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, and each of their and
their Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, and stockholders
(including the directors of Parent and the Company to be elected effective
as of the Closing pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 5.2_ hereof) and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Reviewable Document. Each Party warrants and represents to the other
Party that all such information supplied by it shall, as of the date of the
filing of the Reviewable Document, be true and correct in all material
respects and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) At a reasonable time prior to the filing, issuance, or other submission or
public disclosure of a Reviewable Document by Parent or the Company, the
other party shall each be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon such Reviewable Document and give its consent to the form thereof, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and each party shall accept
and incorporate all reasonable comments from the other party to any such
Reviewable Document prior to filing, issuance, submission or disclosure
thereof. Furthermore, Parent and the Company shall cooperate and mutually
agree upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) any
response to any SEC comments on any Reviewable Document and shall otherwise
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be declared effective by the SEC, in each case, as promptly as practicable
and keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Transactions.

 

(c) Any language included in a Reviewable Document that reflects the comments
of the reviewing party, as well as any text as to which the reviewing party
has not commented upon after being given a reasonable opportunity to comment,
shall be deemed to have been approved by the reviewing party and may
henceforth be used by other party in other Reviewable Documents and in other
documents distributed by the other party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without further review or consent of the
reviewing party.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Parent shall notify each other

or oral comments of the Governmental Authority on, or of any written or oral
request by the Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to, any
such Reviewable Document, and shall promptly supply the other with copies of
all correspondence between it or any of its representatives and the
Governmental Authority with respect to any of the foregoing filings or
submissions. Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts, after consultation with each other, to resolve all such
requests or comments with respect to the any Reviewable Document as promptly
as reasonably practicable after receipt of any comments of the Governmental
Authority. All correspondence and communications to the
Governmental Authority made by Parent or the Company with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto

38

    

5.6 _No Securities Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall engage in any purchases
or sales of the securities of Parent prior to the Effective Time without the
consent of Parent. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to require each of its Affiliates that it controls to comply with the
foregoing requirement.

5.7 _No Claim_ __ _ Against_ __ _ Trust Fund_. Notwithstanding anything
else in this Agreement, the Company acknowledges that it has read Parents
final prospectus dated November 10, 2020 (" _Final Prospectus_ ") and
understands that Parent has established the Trust Fund for the benefit of
Parents public stockholders and that Parent may disburse monies from the
Trust Fund only (a) to Parents public stockholders in the event they elect to
convert their shares into cash in accordance with Parents Charter Documents
and/or the liquidation of Parent or (b) to Parent after, or concurrently with,
the consummation of a business combination. Accordingly, the Company, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby waives all rights, title,
interest or claim of any kind against Parent to collect from the Trust Fund
any monies that may be owed to them by Parent for any reason whatsoever,
including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement by Parent or
any negotiations, agreements or understandings with Parent (whether in the
past, present or future), and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund at
any time for any reason whatsoever. This paragraph will survive the
termination of this Agreement for any reason, but notwithstanding anything
set forth herein will not limit the rights of the Company or its Stockholders
at or following the Closing.

 

5.8 _Disclosure of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company will
provide the others with prompt written notice of any event, development or
condition of which it obtains knowledge that (a) gives such Party any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the obligations of the other Party
set forth in _ Article VI_ will not be satisfied, or (b) would require any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

5.9 _Securities Listing_. From the date hereof through the Effective Time,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable effort to cause Parent to remain
listed as a public company on the NYSE, and shall prepare and submit to NYSE a
listing application, if required under NYSE rules, in connection with the
Merger and covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain approval for the listing of
such shares of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE, and the Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to such listing.

5.10 _Charter Protections; Directors_ __ __ _ and Officers_ __ __ _
Liability Insurance_.

(a) All rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring through the
Closing Date now existing in favor of the current directors and officers of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under applicable Law or as provided in
the Charter Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in any
indemnification agreements shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Parent
and the Company, respectively (or policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous), with
respect to claims arising from facts and events that occurred prior to the
Closing Date. In the event that Parent does not then have in effect a policy
of directors and officers liability insurance, upon the Closing, Parent
shall obtain a "tail" insurance policy that provides coverage for at least a
six-year period from the Closing Date, for the benefit of the current
officers and directors of Parent with respect to claims arising from acts,
events or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _D andO Tail
Insurance_"), with coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
that are customary and prudent under the circumstances. The premium for such
DandO Tail Insurance shall be paid for by Parent. Parent shall cause such DandO
Tail Insurance to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term,
and shall honor, and cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to honor, all
obligations thereunder.

 

(c) If the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company assume the obligations set forth in
this _ Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _ Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who will have been a
director or officer of the Company for all periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and may not be changed without the consent of a majority of those
Persons serving on Parents Board after the Closing Date who served on the
Companys Board immediately prior to the Closing Date.

5.11 _Insider Loans_. The Company shall cause each executive officer of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, at or prior to Closing (i) repay to the
Company any loan by the Company to such Person and any other amount owed by
such Person to the Company; and (ii) cause any guaranty or similar
arrangement pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the payment or
performance of any obligations of such Person to a third party to be
terminated.

 



39

    

5.12 _Parent Borrowings_. Through the Closing, Parent shall, after
consultation with the Company, be allowed to borrow funds from its directors,
officers and/or stockholders to meet its reasonable capital requirements, with
any such loans to be made only as reasonably required by the operation of
Parent in due course on a non-interest bearing basis and repayable in cash at
Closing (the " _Parent Borrowings_ "), and at the option of the lender
thereof, up to $1,500,000 of which Parent Borrowings still outstanding may be
convertible at the Effective Time into Parent Warrants at a conversion price
of $1.50 per warrant, with such Parent Warrants having the same terms as the
Parent Warrants registered at the time of Parents initial public offering.

 

5.13 _Trust Fund Disbursement_. Parent shall cause the Trust Fund to be
disbursed as contemplated by this Agreement and the Trust Agreement
immediately upon the Closing. All liabilities and obligations of Parent due

Ancillary Agreements and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein or therein,
including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto or thereto, and the

constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both

with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; and (b) are not intended
to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder (except as
specifically provided in this Agreement, including _ Sections 5.10_ and _

8.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the

jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 

8.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,

hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to

 prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _ Section_ __ _
8.6_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such injunction.

unavailable, any other court in the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction,
any federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, agrees that process may be
served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware
for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and
manner of service of process. Each party hereto hereby agrees not to commence
any legal proceedings relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any jurisdiction or courts other than as
provided herein. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

8.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

8.10 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties; provided, however, that the Company and its
Subsidiaries may collaterally assign any of its or their rights hereunder to
any of its debt financing sources. Subject to the first sentence of this _
Section_ __ _ 8.10_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

8.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time only by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties. The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any
Party shall not restrict the ability of the board of directors of such Party
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _ Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or to
cause such Party to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this
_ Section_ __ _ 8.11_.

 

8.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party hereto
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

8.13  _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement shall
mean United States dollars.

 



52

    

8.14 _Schedules_. The information furnished in the Schedules is arranged in
sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement, and the disclosures
in any section of the Schedules shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and (b) other Sections of this Agreement to the extent
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference), that it is
reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is also applicable to
such other Sections of this Agreement. The Schedules and the information and
disclosures contained in such Schedules are intended only to qualify and
limit the representations and warranties of the parties contained in this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope of any such
representation or warranty. The inclusion of any information in the Schedules
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment that such information
is material or outside the ordinary course of business. The inclusion of any
fact or information in a Schedule is not intended to be construed as an
admission or concession as to the legal effect of any such fact or
information in any proceeding between any party and any Person who is not a
party.

 

8.15 _Nonsurvival_ __ _ of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None
of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements in this Agreement (or in any Ancillary Agreement or in any
certificate, statement or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
an Ancillary Agreement), including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and
other provisions, shall survive the Closing, and they shall terminate and
expire upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (and there shall be no
liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those
covenants and agreements contained herein (or in instruments executed pursuant
to this Agreement) that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in part
after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches to the extent
occurring after the Closing and (b) this _ Article VIII_.

8.16  _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. No past,

of any Party hereto, any Affiliate of any Party hereto or any of the foregoing

representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
