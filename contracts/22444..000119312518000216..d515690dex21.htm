(a) Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, all consents required with respect
to the transfer of the Real Property Leases, the Equipment Leases, Assumed

the Selling Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
required to make any payments or any other economic concessions, incur any
Liability, commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any such consents other
than payments that do not exceed $50,000 in the aggregate. With respect to the
IT Transition Agreements, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, all consents
required with respect to the transfer or other transition under the IT
Transition Agreements, which shall include payment of their portion of the IT
Transition Costs in accordance with Section 10.8 of this Agreement. Seller
and Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts in obtaining all
consents, licenses, sublicenses or approvals necessary or desirable to permit
Seller and its Affiliates (and their respective agents) to provide
the services contemplated under the Transition Services Agreement (the " _TSA
Consents_ "). Except for the IT Transition Costs, the cost and expense of
obtaining the TSA consents shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchasers, on the other hand.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other than
Section 6.2(j), there shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement any Real Property Lease, Equipment Lease, Assumed Permit or
Assumed Contract that is not assignable or transferable without the consent of
any Person other than Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates or GP/Asset Purchaser, to the extent that such consent shall not
have been given prior to the Closing (such Contracts, the " _Unassigned
Contracts_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Seller, the Selling
Subsidiaries and GP/Asset Purchaser shall have the continuing obligation until
twelve (12) months after the Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents to the assignment or transfer thereof, it being
understood that none of Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to make any payments or any other
economic concessions, incur any Liability, commence any litigation or
offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party
to obtain any such consents other than payments that do not exceed $50,000 in
the aggregate (including any payments made in connection with Section 2.6(a)).
Upon obtaining the requisite third-party consents thereto, such Unassigned
Contracts, if otherwise includable in the Purchased Assets or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall promptly be transferred and assigned to GP/Asset
Purchaser hereunder.

 

(c) With respect to any Unassigned Contract, after the Closing, until any
requisite consent is obtained therefor and the same is transferred and
assigned to GP/Asset Purchaser, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in
endeavoring to obtain a mutually agreeable arrangement with respect thereto,
under which (i) GP/Asset Purchaser would obtain the benefits and assume the
Assumed Liabilities (as limited by Section 2.4(a)) under such Unassigned
Contract, in accordance with this Agreement, including by subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing to GP/Asset Purchaser, and (ii) the covenants and
obligations thereunder would be performed by GP/Asset Purchaser in Sellers
or the Selling Subsidiarys name and all benefits and Assumed Liabilities (as
limited by Section 2.4(a)) existing thereunder would be for GP/Asset
Purchasers account.

 



31 Section 2.7. _Estimated Purchase Price; Payment; Assumed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall in good faith prepare (in consultation and cooperation with Purchaser)
and deliver to Purchasers a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Sellers calculation of (i) the Estimated Purchase Price and
(ii) each of the Estimated Purchase Price Elements, together with reasonable
supporting detail with respect to the calculation of such amounts. _Schedule
A_ sets forth a hypothetical sample Estimated Closing Statement which
illustrates the method by which the Estimated Purchase Price would have been
calculated if the Closing occurred on June 30, 2017 and the accounting
methodologies, principles and procedures used in the calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with Section 2.8(f).

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
(i) in consideration of the sale and transfer of the Conveyed Entity Equity
Interests and the Purchased Assets, at or prior to the Closing, Purchasers
shall deliver to Seller an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Purchase
Price _less_ the Escrow Amount and (ii) at the Closing, GP/Asset Purchaser
shall assume all of the Assumed Liabilities.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Purchasers shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
an amount in cash equal to the Escrow Amount to an account designated by the
Escrow Agent (such account, the " _Escrow Account_ ").

 

Section 2.8. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Purchasers shall
in good faith prepare and deliver to Seller for its review a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its calculation of (i) the Purchase Price
and (ii) each of the Purchase Price Elements, together with reasonable
supporting detail with respect to the calculation of such amounts. The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Section
2.8(f).

(b) Seller and its accountants and financial and other advisors may make
reasonable inquiries of Purchasers and/or Purchasers Representatives
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement
arising in the course of Sellers review. Seller shall complete its review of
the Closing Statement within thirty (30) days after the delivery thereof to
Seller. During such review period, Purchasers shall provide Seller and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to the premises, books and records and
Representatives of the Business, the Conveyed Entities and Purchasers
(including all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents
prepared by Purchasers or their Representatives (including its outside
accountants) to the extent such materials have been prepared in connection
with the calculation of any Purchase Price Element) for the purpose of
completing Sellers review of the Closing Statement. Promptly following
completion of its review (but in no event later than the conclusion of the
thirty (30) day period), Seller may submit to Purchasers a letter regarding
its concurrence or disagreement 

 



32  with the accuracy of the Closing Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such letter must specify (i) the items of the Closing Statement with which
Seller disagrees; (ii) the adjustments that Seller proposes to be made to the
Closing Statement (a " _Disputed Item_ "); and (iii) the specific amount of
such disagreement and reasonable supporting documentation and calculations
thereof. If Seller does not deliver a letter disagreeing with the accuracy of
the Closing Statement before the conclusion of such thirty (30) day period,
the Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and Seller
shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the
Closing Statement. If Seller does deliver such a letter, following such
delivery, Seller and Purchasers shall attempt in good faith to resolve
promptly any disagreement as to the computation of any item in the Closing
Statement. Any items as to which there is no disagreement shall be deemed
agreed. If a resolution of such disagreement has not been effected within
fifteen (15) days (or longer, as mutually agreed by the Parties)
after delivery of such letter, then Seller and Purchasers shall submit any
Disputed Item to the Independent Accountant for determination. The
determination of the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, with respect to any Disputed Item shall be completed within
thirty (30) days of submission of such Disputed Item to the Independent
Accountant (or longer, as mutually agreed by the Parties), shall be determined
in accordance with this Agreement and shall be final and binding upon Seller
and Purchasers. The Independent Accountant shall adopt a position within the
range of positions submitted by Seller and Purchasers with respect to any
Disputed Item. The Independent Accountant shall not review any line items or
make any determination with respect to any matter other than with respect to
Disputed Items. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be shared as follows:

 

(i) if the Independent Accountant resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor
of Sellers position (the Final Purchase Price so determined is referred to
herein as the " _Low Value_ "), then Purchasers shall be obligated to pay for
all of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant;

 

(ii) if the Independent Accountant resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor
of Purchasers position (the Final Purchase Price so determined is referred
to herein as the " _High Value_ "), then Seller shall be obligated to pay for
all of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant; and

 

(iii) if the Independent Accountant neither resolves all of the Disputed Items
in favor of Purchasers position nor resolves all of the Disputed Items in
favor of Sellers position (the Final Purchase Price so determined is referred
to herein as the " _Actual Value_ "), Purchasers shall be responsible for such
fraction of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant equal to (x)
the difference between the High Value and the Actual Value over (y) the
difference between the High Value and the Low Value, and Seller shall be
responsible for the remainder of the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant.

(c) Purchasers shall, if necessary, revise the Closing Statement to reflect
the final determination of the Purchase Price in accordance with Section
2.7(b) and Section 2.8(b) (as adjusted, the " _Final Purchase Price_ ").

 



33 (d) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Purchase Price, (i) if the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price, then Purchasers shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
entire amount of such excess or (ii) if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds
the Final Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay to Purchasers an amount equal
to the entire amount of such excess.

(e) Any payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.8(d) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing
by Purchasers or Seller, as the case may be, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Purchase Price.

(f) Each of the Estimated Closing Statement (including the Estimated Purchase
Price and Estimated Purchase Price Elements) and the Closing Statement
(including the Purchase Price and Purchase Price Elements) shall be prepared
and calculated in accordance with the definitions of such terms contained in
the Agreement and _Schedule A_ and shall be prepared and calculated in
a manner consistent with the accounting methodologies, principles and
procedures used by Seller in preparing the Financial Statement (including
calculating reserves and accruals in accordance with the same methodology used
to calculate such reserves and accruals in the preparation of the Financial
Statement), except that the Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing
Statement (and all calculations set forth in each) shall (i) not include any
purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) be based on facts and
circumstances as they exist up to the Closing and shall exclude the effect of
any act, decision or event occurring after the Closing (other than the
determination of the Final Purchase Price in accordance with this Section
2.8); (iii) include the same line accounts (and only those line accounts) set
forth on _Schedule A_ ; and (iv) utilize those accounting methodologies,
principles and procedures set forth on _Schedule A_.

Section 2.9. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Within one hundred and twenty (120)
Business Days after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the " _Allocation_ "), allocating the Final Purchase Price (plus
Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under
applicable Tax Law) to the Conveyed Entity Equity Interests (and to the extent
required or permitted by applicable Tax Law, the underlying assets held by the
Conveyed Entities) and the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code. If within sixty (60) Business Days following the delivery of the
Allocation, Seller objects to such Allocation to Purchasers in writing, Seller
and Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve their
disagreement and agree on the Allocation. Should such foregoing negotiations
not result in an agreement within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by
Purchasers of such written objection from Seller, then either (a)
Purchasers or (b) Seller may submit this matter to the Independent
Accountant. The Independent Accountant will deliver to Purchasers and Seller a
written determination of the final Allocation within thirty (30) days of the
submission of the dispute to the Independent Accountant, which determination
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties hereto absent manifest
error. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Independent Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.9 will be split and
paid for on a 50%/50% basis between (i) Purchasers and (ii) Seller. None of
the Parties hereto or any Affiliate thereof shall take, or permit any
Affiliate to take, any position for any Tax purpose (whether in connection
with audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the final
Allocation, except as required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of Tax Law).

 



34 Section 2.10. _Closing_.

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND SELLING SUBSIDIARIES_

 

Except as set forth in the letter (the " _Seller Disclosure Letter_ ")
delivered by Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries to Purchasers concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement (it being understood that any matter
disclosed on any Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be
disclosed on any other Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Letter for which
applicability of such information and disclosure is reasonably apparent on its
face), Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries hereby, jointly and severally,
represent and warrant to Purchasers, as follows:

 

Section 3.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each member of the Seller Group
is an entity of the type set forth on _Schedule 3.1_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and is duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each member
of the Seller Group is authorized, qualified and licensed to do business as a
foreign entity in each other jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
otherwise holding of the Purchased Assets or conducting the Business would
require such member of the Seller Group to be so qualified, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Each member of the Seller Group has full corporate or
partnership power and authority to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold
the Purchased Assets owned, leased or otherwise held by it and to conduct the
Business in all material respects as currently conducted. Seller has made
available to Purchasers true, correct and complete copies of the certificates
of incorporation, certificates of formation, the bylaws and limited
partnership agreement (or the equivalent organizational documents), as
applicable, of each member of the Seller Group, each as currently in effect
and reflecting any and all amendments thereto through the date of this
Agreement. Such organizational documents are in full force and effect, and
each member of the Seller Group is not in material violation of any provision
thereof.

 

Section 3.2. _Corporate Authority; Binding Effect_.

 

(a) Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each other document, agreement or instrument to be
executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Seller
Documents_ "), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
and to perform its obligations hereunder and 

 



36  thereunder. Each Selling Subsidiary has all requisite corporate or
partnership power and authority to execute and deliver each document,
agreement or instrument to be executed and delivered by such Selling
Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Selling Subsidiary Documents_
"), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery
by Seller of this Agreement and the Seller Documents and the performance by
Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized
by all requisite corporate action on the part of Seller. The execution and
delivery by each Selling Subsidiary of the Selling Subsidiary Documents and
the performance by such Selling Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate or partnership
action on the part of such Selling Subsidiary. No other corporate or other
proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
any Seller Document or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. No other corporate, partnership or other proceedings on the part of
any Selling Subsidiary are necessary to authorize any Selling Subsidiary
Document or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

(b) This Agreement, when executed and delivered by Seller and each Selling
Subsidiary, assuming due execution and delivery hereof by Purchasers and
Guarantor, constitutes the valid and binding obligations of Seller and each
Selling Subsidiary, enforceable against Seller and each Selling Subsidiary in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity
or at law) (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ "). Each Seller Document, when
executed and delivered by Seller, assuming due execution and delivery thereof
by any other counterparties thereto, constitutes, or if such Seller Document
is delivered at the Closing, will constitute at the Closing, the valid and
binding obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions.

 

(c) Each Selling Subsidiary Document, when executed and delivered by the
applicable Selling Subsidiary, assuming due execution and delivery thereof by
the other counterparties thereto, constitutes, or if such Selling Subsidiary
Document is delivered at the Closing, will constitute at the Closing, the
valid and binding obligations of such Selling Subsidiary, enforceable against
such Selling Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 3.3. _Capital Structure_. _Schedule 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter sets forth the authorized capitalization of each Conveyed Entity and
the Equity Interests in each Conveyed Entity, which are validly issued and
outstanding, and, with respect to Conveyed Entity 1, fully paid and non-
assessable. There are no outstanding warrants, options, agreements,
subscriptions, convertible or exchangeable securities, voting agreements or
other Contracts or obligations pursuant to which any Conveyed Entity is or may
become obligated to issue, sell, purchase, return or redeem or vote or
abstain from voting any shares of capital stock or other securities or
partnership interests or other equity interests of any Conveyed Entity, and no
equity securities or other equity interests of any Conveyed Entity are
reserved for issuance for any purpose. Selling Subsidiary 1 owns of record
and beneficially the outstanding Conveyed Entity 1 Equity Interests as
indicated on _Schedule 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, which constitute
all of the issued 

 



37  and outstanding Equity Interests of Conveyed Entity 1, and Selling
Subsidiary 1 and Selling Subsidiary 3 collectively own of record the Conveyed
Entity 2 Equity Interests as indicated on  _Schedule 3.3_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, which constitute all of the issued and outstanding Equity
Interests of Conveyed Entity 2, in each case, free and clear of all Liens
except for restrictions imposed by securities laws applicable to unregistered
securities generally, restrictions on transfer set forth in the organizational
documents of such Selling Subsidiary or Conveyed Entity and Liens created by
or as a result of the acts of Purchasers or any of their Affiliates. No
Equity Interests of any Conveyed Entity are held by such Conveyed Entity in
treasury. There is no obligation or Contract, contingent or otherwise, of any
Conveyed Entity to provide funds to or make any investment in (in the form of
a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) any other Person. There are no
bond, debentures, notes, or other Indebtedness of any member of the Seller
Group having the right to vote or consent (or convertible into or exchangeable
for securities of any Conveyed Entity having the right to vote or consent) on
any matters on which the equityholders of any Conveyed Entity may vote.
Neither Conveyed Entity has any direct or indirect Subsidiaries nor holds any
Equity Interests in any Person.

 

Section 3.4. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Seller Documents by Seller, the

arrangement that is the subject of a Parent Guarantee or Parent LofC that has
the effect of increasing the exposure under the applicable Parent Guarantee or
Parent LofC. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
obligation to extend the term, or otherwise agree to any amendment or waiver,
of any Parent Guarantee or Parent LofC that remains outstanding after the
Closing.

 



76 (b) To the extent Purchasers are unable to terminate or replace a Parent
Guarantee or Parent LofC or obtain the beneficiarys consent to the
substitution thereof prior to the Closing as contemplated by Section 5.9(a),
Purchasers shall (i) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
beneficiary of any such Parent Guarantee or Parent LofC to accept, effective
as of the Closing, an additional guarantee from Guarantor and (ii) have a
continuing obligation after the Closing to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to have any such Parent Guarantee terminated or replaced in a manner
consistent with Section 5.9(a) and to have any such Parent LofC replaced or
terminated. To the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates has performance
obligations under any such Parent Guarantee, Purchasers and their respective
Affiliates shall perform such obligations on behalf of such party or otherwise
take such action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to put such party in
the same position as if Purchasers (or their respective Affiliates), and not
such party, had performed or were performing such obligations.

(c) Guarantor shall, effective as of the Closing, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause an indemnity release and transfer with respect to
each surety of each surety and other bond set forth on _Schedule_ _5.9(c)(i)_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Seller Surety Bonds_ ", and together
with the Parent Guarantees and the Parent LofCs, the " _Seller Credit Support
Instruments_ "). To the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates is not
released from such Seller Surety Bond as a result of such process, Purchasers
shall (i) use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide a guarantee,
effective as of the Closing, with respect to each Seller Surety Bond from
which Seller or its Affiliates has not been released as of Closing related to
the guarantees set forth on _Schedule 5.9(c)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and (ii) have a continuing obligation after the Closing to use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to have Seller or any of
its Affiliates that are party to such Seller Surety Bonds removed as a party
to and guarantor under such Seller Surety Bonds. Seller, Selling Subsidiary 1
and Selling Subsidiary 3 shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained all
Seller Surety Bonds in effect from and after the Closing to the extent Seller,
Selling Subsidiary 1, Selling Subsidiary 3 or their respective Affiliates
remain a party or otherwise are not removed as a party pursuant to the
preceding sentence and shall not terminate or enter into any amendment or
waiver with respect to any Seller Surety Bond without Purchasers prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Purchasers shall not, and shall not permit the Conveyed Entities
or their respective Affiliates, to enter into any amendment or waiver with
respect to, or exercise any renewal option or other similar provision under,
any Seller Surety Bond that has the effect of extending the term of such
Seller Surety Bond beyond its current term or otherwise increasing the
exposure under the applicable Seller Surety Bond. None of Seller, Selling
Subsidiary 1, Selling Subsidiary 3 nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall have any obligation to extend the term, or otherwise agree to any
amendment or waiver, of any Seller Surety Bond that remains outstanding after
the Closing.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, Purchasers shall indemnify Seller, Selling
Subsidiary 1, Selling Subsidiary 3, their respective Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, managers, general partners and employees (the
" _Seller Credit Support Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all (i)
Losses arising from, or relating to, the Parent Guarantees, the Parent LofCs
and the Seller Surety Bonds that remain outstanding after the Closing, whether
or not any such Seller Credit Support Instrument is drawn upon or required to
be performed, and shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later than
five (5) Business Days after written demand therefor from any Seller Credit
Support Indemnitee, to the extent that any Seller Credit

 



77  Support Instrument is called upon and any such Seller Credit Support
Indemnitees makes any payment or incurs any Liability in respect of events
arising following the Closing under any such Seller Credit Support Instrument
and (ii) reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by any Seller Credit Support Indemnitee in respect of maintaining any Parent
Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond and any Parent LofC, solely for the period from
and after the Closing.

(e) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Purchasers a supplement to _Schedule 5.9(a)(i)_ , _Schedule
5.9(a)(ii)_ , _Schedule_ __ _ 5.9(c)(i)_ and _Schedule 5.9(c)(ii)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter to reflect items arising in the ordinary course of
the Business subsequent to the date of this Agreement, which are entered into
without violating Section 5.2 of this Agreement.

 

(f) To the extent requested by any other Party, the Parties shall reasonably
cooperate with one another in connection with this Section 5.9. Seller and
the Selling Subsidiaries shall execute a customary broker of record letter in
favor of Marsh USA Inc. or one of its Affiliates to facilitate the indemnity
release and transfer process with respect to the Seller Surety Bonds.

Section 5.10. _Seller Insurance_. At the Closing, Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries shall have Purchasers and their Affiliates named as additional
insureds under Sellers, the Selling Subsidiaries or their Affiliates
occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies with respect to
events related to the Business that occurred or existed prior to the Closing.
With respect to events related to the Business that occurred or existed prior
to the Closing and that are covered by Sellers, the Selling Subsidiaries or
their Affiliates occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies,
Purchasers may make claims, or, at Purchasers election, Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, make claims,
under such policies to the extent such coverage and limits are
available under such policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers shall
(a) reimburse Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries and their Affiliates for
any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in connection with making such
claims and any increased costs incurred by Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates associated with claims made under such
policies or programs and (b) exclusively bear (and Seller, the Selling
Subsidiaries and their Affiliates shall have no obligation to repay or
reimburse Purchasers for) the amount of any deductibles associated with
claims made and actually paid under such policies and programs. Purchasers, on
the one hand, and Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
shall cooperate in connection with making such claim, and each Party shall
provide the other with all reasonably requested information necessary for
Seller to make such claim.

Section 5.11.  _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements_.

(a) Excluding each Closing Agreement (which shall remain in effect following
the Closing in accordance with their terms), Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries shall cause all Contracts solely between the Conveyed Entities,
on the one hand, and Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates
(other than the Conveyed Entities), on the other hand, to be terminated at or
prior to the Closing and shall cause all amounts payable thereunder to be paid
as required prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

 



78 (b) To the extent there are receivables or payables between the Conveyed
Entities, on the one hand, and Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Entities), on the other hand (other than
pursuant to, or in accordance with, the Closing Agreements and other than the
Assumed Intercompany Receivables and Assumed Intercompany Payables, the "
_Intercompany Payables and Receivables_ "), Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries shall cause all such Intercompany Payables and Receivables to be
paid and satisfied by the party that is the obligor as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

Section 5.12. _Use of Seller Names_. Purchasers agree that, as of the Closing
Date, Seller shall be the sole owner of the Seller Names, and Purchasers shall
have no right to use same except as provided in this Section 5.12. No later
than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall make all
filings with all Governmental Authorities to adopt new corporate, trade, d/b/a
or other names that do not contain the Seller Names, shall prosecute such name
changes diligently until completion and shall provide Seller with prompt
written proof of same. Purchasers and their Affiliates shall not use (and
shall not permit others to use) the Seller Names after the Closing Date,
except (i) in a neutral, non-trademark manner to describe the history of the
Business and (ii) in internal Tax, legal, business, employment or similar
records. In the event Seller Names are on physical or tangible materials used
in connection with the Business as of the Closing Date, Seller grants to
Purchaser a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
license to use the Seller Names solely on such physical or tangible materials
for one-hundred-eighty (180) days thereafter, in a manner consistent with past
practice and customary phase-out use. 

Section 5.13. _Debt Obligations_.

 

Substantially simultaneously with the Closing on the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause to be delivered to the trustee (the " _Existing Notes Trustee_ ")
in respect of all of the outstanding series of the notes (the " _Existing
Notes_ ") of Seller or its Affiliates set forth on Schedule 5.13 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter notices of prepayment and redemption (collectively, the "
_Existing Notes Redemption Notices_ ") with respect to the Existing Notes and,
prior to the redemption date, will deposit with the Existing Notes Trustee
cash in the necessary amount to redeem all Existing Notes then outstanding in
full and to pay in full any other costs, expenses, fees and obligations in
respect of or in connection with the Existing Notes on the redemption date set
forth in the Existing Notes Redemption Notices and to discharge in full
the Existing Notes and any and all documents relating to the Existing Notes.
Seller shall cause the Existing Notes Redemption Notices and all terms of the
Discharge, prepayment and redemption to comply in all material respects with
the terms governing the Existing Notes and any and all documents relating to
the Existing Notes.

 



79 Section 5.14. _ISRA_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Selling Subsidiary 2 shall timely file a
General Information Notice, select a Licensed Site Remediation Professional
(" _LSRP_ ") subject to Purchasers approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct a
Preliminary Assessment and, if necessary, a Site Investigation and/or
Remedial Investigation and Remedial Actions that are approved by such LSRP
(subject to Purchasers review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) for any facility at any Real Property
that constitutes an Industrial Establishment subject to ISRA in order for a
Response Action Outcome to be issued for such Industrial Establishment (the "
_ISRA Work_ "). If the ISRA Work is not completed prior to the Closing, then
Purchasers will execute a Remediation Certification to be filed with NJDEP
and shall complete the ISRA Work using the most cost-effective remedies
available and the most cost-effective means of implementing such remedies
(including, to the extent available under applicable Environmental Law, the
acceptance and implementation of any activity and use limitations) that are
not inconsistent with the continued use of the property as currently used, and
Purchasers shall use either the same LSRP that Seller retains, or an LSRP
selected by Purchasers subject to Sellers approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that Seller shall be responsible
for all costs Purchasers reasonably incur for such remaining ISRA Work.
Purchasers agree to be responsible for establishing any required Remediation
Funding Source in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:26C-5 for the ISRA Work,
_provided_ that Seller shall be solely responsible for funding such
Remediation Funding Source using a mechanism reasonably satisfactory to
Purchasers (it being understood that Seller in no event may use a self-
guarantee to do so) in an amount equal to the detailed remediation
cost estimate for the ISRA Work as reasonably determined by Purchasers LSRP
in a manner consistent with all applicable NJDEP guidance under ISRA, and
Purchasers shall be reimbursed for any costs to which they are entitled under
this Section 5.14(a) from such Remediation Funding Source. Annually after the
Closing as required under ISRA, and until the issuance of a Response Action
Outcome for the ISRA Work, Purchasers LSRP shall develop an updated detailed
remediation cost estimate in the same manner as the initial estimate and
shall provide it to Seller, and Seller shall be responsible for updating the
funding then present in the Remediation Funding Source to equal such updated
remediation cost estimate. Upon the issuance of a Response Action Outcome for
the ISRA Work for which a Remediation Funding Source was established, Seller
shall be entitled to any value remaining that Seller has funded in
such Remediation Funding Source, and Purchasers shall cooperate with Seller
in order for Seller to promptly recover any such value after such issuance.

 

(b) Regarding the Pending ISRA Proceeding, Purchasers will execute a
Remediation Certification to be filed with NJDEP and shall obtain
the issuance of a Response Action Outcome using the most cost-effective
remedies available and the most cost-effective means of implementing such
remedies (including, to the extent available under applicable Environmental
Law, the acceptance and implementation of any activity and use limitations)
that are not inconsistent with the continued use of the property as currently
used, and Purchasers shall use either the same LSRP as currently designated or
an LSRP selected by Purchasers, subject to Sellers approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that Seller shall
be responsible for all costs Purchasers reasonably incur in so obtaining such
Response Action Outcome. Purchasers agree to be responsible for establishing
the Remediation Funding Source in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:26C-5 for the
Pending ISRA Proceeding (the " _Pending Remediation Funding Source_ "),
_provided_ that Seller shall be solely responsible for funding such Pending
Remediation Funding Source using a mechanism reasonably satisfactory to
Purchasers (it being understood that Seller in no event may use a self-
guarantee to do so) in an amount equal 

 



80  to the existing Pending Remediation Funding Source in effect as of the
Closing. No less than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, Purchasers LSRP
shall provide an amount that it has reasonably determined to be the total
cost Purchasers are likely to incur pursuant to the requirements of this
Section 5.14(b) to obtain the Response Action Outcome for the Pending ISRA
Proceeding (" _Remediation Amount_ "). Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
arrange for the amount available in the Pending Remediation Funding Source to
equal the greater of (i) the Remediation Amount or (ii) $2.5 million. Annually
after the Closing as required under ISRA, and until the issuance of a
Response Action Outcome for the Pending ISRA Proceeding, Purchasers LSRP
shall develop an updated Remediation Amount, and Seller shall be responsible
for updating the funding then present in the Pending Remediation
Funding Source to equal such updated Remediation Amount. Purchasers shall be
reimbursed for any costs to which they are entitled under this 5.14(b) from
the Pending Remediation Funding Source until such Pending Remediation Funding
Source is depleted. Seller shall be entitled to recover any value remaining
in the Pending Remediation Funding Source upon the issuance of a Response
Action Outcome for the Pending ISRA Proceeding, and Purchasers shall cooperate
with Seller in order for Seller to promptly recover any such value after such
issuance.

(c) (i) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall: (A) afford Purchasers the
opportunity to review and provide Seller with comments on any reports to or
other substantive written communications with the NJDEP regarding the ISRA
Work or the Pending ISRA Proceeding reasonably in advance of the submission of
any such report or communication, and shall reasonably and in good faith
consider any comments on such reports or communications as Purchasers may
reasonably provide; and (B) provide Purchasers with reasonable advance notice
of any meetings, conference calls, or other substantive engagements with the
NJDEP regarding the ISRA Work or the Pending ISRA Proceeding and shall afford
Purchasers the opportunity to be present for and participate in any such
meeting, conference call or other substantive engagement. (ii) After the
Closing, Purchasers shall: (A) afford Seller the opportunity to review and
provide Purchasers with comments on any reports to or other substantive
written communications with the NJDEP regarding the ISRA Work or the
Pending ISRA Proceeding reasonably in advance of the submission of any such
report or communication, and shall reasonably and in good faith consider any
comments on such reports or communications as Seller may reasonably provide;
and (B) also provide Seller with reasonable advance notice of any meetings,
conference calls, or other substantive engagements with the NJDEP regarding
the ISRA Work or the Pending ISRA Proceeding and shall afford Seller the
opportunity to be present for and participate in any such meeting, conference
call or other substantive engagement.

(d) It is understood that, in the event any ISRA Work for the property that
is the subject of the Pending ISRA Proceeding remains to be performed after
the Closing, a single Remediation Certification may be submitted, and a single
Remediation Funding Source may be established, for both matters;
notwithstanding such a submission or such an establishment, the Purchasers
and Sellers responsibilities with respect to such ISRA Work and the Pending
ISRA Proceeding shall remain as provided in this Section 5.14.

 

(e) As used in this Agreement, each of the terms General Information Notice,
Industrial Establishment, Licensed Site Remediation Professional, Preliminary
Assessment, Site Investigation, Remedial Investigation, Remedial Actions,
Response Action Outcome, Remediation Certification and Remediation Funding
Source shall have the meaning assigned to it under ISRA.

 



81 Section 5.15. _Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition_.

(a) For a period of fifteen (15) months from and after the Closing
Date, without the prior written consent of Purchasers, Seller and the Selling

hire, employ, make an offer to hire or otherwise solicit, induce or encourage
any Purchaser Employee to leave his or her employment with Purchasers, the
Conveyed Entities or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , nothing in this Section 5.15(a) shall prohibit Seller, the
Selling Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates from hiring any Purchaser

their respective Affiliates was terminated involuntarily; (B) with an annual
base salary of less than $100,000 or whose employment with Purchasers, the

of general solicitation for employment that is not targeted specifically at
any Purchaser Employee; or (D) who initially and entirely independently
contacts Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates on his or
her own initiative, without solicitation or encouragement (directly or
indirectly) by Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates.

 

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the fifth
(5th) anniversary thereof, none of Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any of
their respective Affiliates (collectively, the " _Restricted Parties_ "),
directly or indirectly, shall engage in fabrication or installation of rebar
and related materials (collectively, " _Restricted Activities_ ") anywhere in
the United States (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include Puerto
Rico), nor shall any Restricted Party, directly or indirectly, be employed by,
invest in, have any ownership interest in, participate in, act as a

Section 5.16. _Additional Undisclosed Contracts_. If, at any time after the
Closing, Seller or any Selling Subsidiary becomes aware of any Undisclosed
Contract that would have been included in the definition of Assumed Contracts,
Seller shall notify Purchasers in writing and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assign and transfer such Undisclosed
Contract if Purchasers so elect in their sole discretion.

(whether direct or indirect) with any Person other than Purchasers, their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives with respect to, and to deal
exclusively with Purchasers and their designated Affiliates regarding, any
agreement, submission, offer or proposal for, or any indication of interest

warranties to any third parties or the indemnification thereof.

(b) Purchasers shall, following written demand from Seller, promptly reimburse

and related statements of net earnings (loss), comprehensive earnings (loss),
changes in shareholders equity and cash flows of the Conveyed entities and
the Business for such fiscal quarter.

 

(e) Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries and the Conveyed Entities shall, and
shall request their respective Representatives to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchasers and their
Representatives in the preparation by Purchasers of all historical and pro
forma financial statements and historical and pro forma financial and other
data of the type reasonably determined by Purchasers to be required to be
filed pursuant to Items 2.01 and 9.01(a) and (b) of Form 8-K promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to this Agreement and the
Closing Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

Section 5.20. _Certain Environmental Limitations_. Following the Closing
Date, each Purchaser agrees that neither it nor its Subsidiaries nor any of
their Representatives shall (a) undertake any invasive sampling or testing
activities at any Real Property other than as follows: (i) as a result of any
Order or direction of any Governmental Authority with authority to issue such
Order or direction; (ii) as required by applicable Law; (iii) in connection
with the Pending ISRA Proceeding or any ISRA proceeding resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably proposed by the
LSRP who is responsible for such ISRA proceeding; (iv) as reasonably necessary
in order to defend against any Action by any unrelated third party that is
not solicited, importuned or instigated by any Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives; or (v) in connection with any
legitimate business purpose of any Purchaser (it being understood that the
primary purpose of such business purpose may not be discovering unknown
environmental Liabilities at the Real Property) or (b) communicate with any
Governmental Authority or any other third party for the purpose of requesting
any Order or direction to undertake any invasive sampling or testing
activities except as provided in subparagraph (a) (it being understood that
the mere reporting of information as required by applicable Environmental Law

Section 5.21. _Electrodes_. Following the Closing Date, for a period of nine
(9) months (the " _Electrode Supply Period_ "), Seller shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to the Mills, and Purchaser or its respective

metric tons of Electrodes (the " _Total Quantity_ ") at a price of fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000) per metric ton, to be delivered to the Mills in
monthly quantities that are substantially

 



86  consistent with past practice on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month
during the Electrode Supply Period (such date in each month, an " _Electrode
Delivery Date_ "). Seller shall invoice Purchaser in arrears on a monthly
basis for the Electrodes delivered on such Electrode Delivery Date. Purchasers
shall pay such invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days of the date of each
such invoice, which due date Seller shall specify on each such invoice. At any
time within sixty (60) days of the date hereof, Purchasers may elect, in their
sole discretion, to reduce the Total Quantity under this Section 5.21 by
delivering a written notice to Seller (in which case the monthly quantities
delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reduced proportionately
to the reduction of the Total Quantity). In the event the Electrode Supplier
experiences a force majeure pursuant to the Electrode Supply Contract during
the Electrode Supply Period or otherwise does not deliver the full amount of
Electrodes required to be delivered to Seller pursuant to the Electrode
Supply Contract, Sellers obligation to deliver Electrodes to the Mills
pursuant to this Section 5.21 shall be reduced to an amount equal to the total
amount of Electrodes that were to be delivered to the Mills pursuant to this
Section 5.21 absent such force majeure event or failure to supply, multiplied
by the quotient of (a) the total amount of Electrodes that were actually
delivered to Sellers under the Electrode Supply Contract, divided by (b) the
total amount of electrodes that were to be delivered to Sellers under the
Electrode Supply Contract absent such force majeure event or failure to
supply.

 

Section 5.22. _Excluded Action_. In connection with the Excluded Action,
unless either directed in writing by Seller or consented to in writing by
Seller prior to such action, following the Closing, Purchasers, the Conveyed
Entities and their respective Affiliates shall not make any decision, take any
action or grant any consent with respect to, assign, transfer, alienate or
sell any rights with respect to or negotiate, settle or compromise the
Excluded Action. Purchasers, the Conveyed Entities and their respective
Affiliates hereby agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions and deliver such consents as directed in writing by Seller with
respect to the Excluded Action, at the sole cost and expense of Seller. In the
event Purchasers, the Conveyed Entities or any of their respective Affiliates
receive any payment with respect to or arising out of the Excluded Action,
such Person shall promptly remit such payment to Seller.

95 Section 8.2. _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article VIII and Section 7.14, from and after the Closing, each of
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries agrees to jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and hold each Purchaser, each of their Affiliates (including the
Conveyed Entities after the Closing) and each of their respective
Representatives (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") harmless from and against,
and compensate, reimburse and pay any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any Purchaser Indemnitee or to which any Purchaser Indemnitee otherwise is or
becomes subject (regardless of whether or not such Losses related to any third
party claim) that arise out of, or result from or are connected with:

 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representations or warranties of Seller or
any Selling Subsidiary set forth in Article III, in the certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 6.3(c) or the Seller Documents (other than the Transition
Services Agreement) or any allegation by a third party that, if true, would
constitute such a breach or inaccuracy;

 

(b) any breach by or failure (partial or total) of Seller or any Selling
Subsidiary (prior to, at or after the Closing) or any Conveyed Entity (at or
prior to the Closing) to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement (other than Section 5.18) or the Seller Documents
(other than the Transition Services Agreement) or any allegation by a third
party that, if true, would constitute such a breach or failure;

(c) any Retained Liability (regardless of whether the facts and
circumstances giving rise to any such Retained Liability are set forth in the
Seller Disclosure Letter), other than (i) Taxes and (ii) the Contamination
Liabilities;

 

(d) to the extent not paid at the Closing, any Closing Indebtedness of any
Conveyed Entity;

 

(e) the Conveyed Entities Retained Liabilities (regardless of whether the
facts and circumstances giving rise to any such Conveyed Entities Retained
Liability are set forth in the Seller Disclosure Letter);

(f) a Third-Party Claim brought after the Closing Date involving
any Purchaser Indemnitee to the extent such Third-Party Claim (i) arises from
the ownership or operations of any member of the Seller Group or any of their
Affiliates and (ii) does not arise from or relate to either (A) any Actions
and Liabilities arising out of or relating to Sellers or the Selling
Subsidiaries (or their predecessors) ownership or operation of the Purchased
Assets Business (as currently or formerly conducted) or the Purchased Assets
to the extent such Liabilities arise out of or relate to events,
circumstances or periods occurring prior to the Closing or (B) Purchasers
ownership or operation of the Business, Purchased Assets or Conveyed Entities
following the Closing; and 

(g) the Contamination Liabilities.

 



96 Section 8.3. _Indemnification by Purchaser_ _s_. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article VIII and Section 7.14, from and after the Closing,
each Purchaser agrees to, jointly and severally, and to cause the Conveyed
Entities to, indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its Affiliates and each of
their respective Representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") harmless from
and against, and compensate, reimburse and pay any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by any Seller Indemnitee or to which any Seller Indemnitee otherwise
is or becomes subject (regardless of whether or not such Losses related to
any third party claim) that arise out of or result from or are connected with:

 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representations or warranties of
Purchasers set forth in Article IV, in the certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 6.2(c) or the Purchaser Documents (other than the Transition Services
Agreement) or any allegation by a third party that, if true, would constitute
such a breach or inaccuracy;

 

(b) any breach by or failure (partial or total) of Purchasers to perform any
of their covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement or the
Purchaser Documents (other than the Transition Services Agreement) or any
allegation by a third party that, if true, would constitute such a breach or
inaccuracy;

 

(c) any Assumed Liability, other than Taxes;

 

(d) any Parent Guarantee that remains outstanding after the Closing; and

 

(e) a Third-Party Claim brought after the Closing Date involving any Seller
Indemnitee to the extent such Third-Party Claim arises out of or relates to
both (i) Purchasers ownership or operation of the Business, Purchased Assets
or Conveyed Entities following the Closing and (ii) any Seller Indemnitees
capacity as a direct or indirect owner, operator, employee, director or
officer of the Business prior to the Closing; _provided_ that no Seller
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of such Third-Party
Claim to the extent a Purchaser Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled
to indemnification from Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries hereunder with
respect to such Third-Party Claim;

Section 8.4.  _Limitations on Indemnification_. The party making a claim for
indemnification under this Article VIII is referred to herein as the "
_Indemnified Party_ ", and the party against whom such claims for
indemnification are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to herein as
the " _Indemnifying Party_ ". Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the indemnification obligations of an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) _De Minimis Claim_. Subject to Section 8.7, no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to an Indemnified Party for, and no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to, any indemnification for a Loss pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (other
than with respect to breaches of the Seller Fundamental Representations or the
Seller Special Representations) or Section 8.3(a) (other than with respect to
breaches of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations), as the case may be,
if, with respect to any individual item of Loss, such item, when combined with
(i) groups or series of related or repetitive individual Losses and (ii)
Losses based on or arising from the same or similar type of underlying issues,
facts, claims or breaches, is less than $200,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Claim_
");

 



97 (b) _Deductible_. Subject to Section 8.7, no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to an Indemnified Party for, and no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to, any indemnification for Losses (i) pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
(other than with respect to breaches of the Seller Fundamental Representations
or the Seller Special Representations) or Section 8.3(a) (other than with
respect to breaches of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations), as the case
may be, unless the aggregate of all indemnifiable Losses in respect of
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (including with respect to
breaches of the Seller Fundamental Representations but not the Seller Special
Representations) or Section 8.3(a) (including with respect to breaches of the
Purchaser Fundamental Representations), as the case may be, would exceed on a
cumulative basis an amount equal $3,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then
only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible, (ii) pursuant to Section
8.2(a) with respect to breaches of the Seller Special Representations, unless
the aggregate of all indemnifiable Losses in respect of indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) with respect to breaches of the Seller Special
Representations would exceed on a cumulative basis $2,000,000 (the " _Special
Representations Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed
the Special Representations Deductible, and (iii) pursuant to Section 8.2(g)
unless the aggregate of all indemnifiable Losses in respect of
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(g) would (A) with respect to each
Mill, exceed on a cumulative basis $250,000 at such Mill and (B) with respect
to each Real Property site other than a Mill, exceed on a cumulative basis
$50,000 at such site, and then (regarding both (A) and (B)) only to the extent
such Losses exceed such amounts with respect to such Mill or such site, as
applicable.

 

(c) _Maximum Amount_.

 

(i) Subject to Section 8.7, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that
Seller as the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for, or that may be
recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees from Seller as the Indemnifying Party
in the aggregate (A) pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (other than with respect to
breaches of the Seller Fundamental Representations or Seller Special
Representations) shall be the Escrow Amount (such amount, the " _Cap_ ") and
only to the extent such funds remain in the Escrow Account, (B) pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) with respect to breaches of the Seller Special Representations
shall be an amount equal to $50,000,000, (C) pursuant to Section 8.2(e) shall
be an amount equal to $15,000,000 and (D) pursuant to Section 8.2(g) shall be
an amount equal to $30,000,000. Subject to Section 8.8, if the remaining
amount of funds in the Escrow Account is not sufficient to satisfy the
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the sole
and exclusive recourse of the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to such
Losses (other than with respect to breaches of the Seller Fundamental
Representations and Seller Special Representations) shall be to seek recovery
under the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a) with respect to breaches of
the Seller Fundamental Representations and Seller Special Representations, the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall first seek recovery for such Losses under the RandW
Insurance Policy and, to the extent coverage is not provided under the RandW
Insurance Policy, shall be entitled to recover such Losses from Seller.
Purchasers shall not enter into any Adverse Amendments with respect to the
RandW Insurance Policy without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



98 (ii) The maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that Purchasers as
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for, or that may be recovered by the
Seller Indemnitees, in the aggregate pursuant to Section 8.3(a) (other than
with respect to breaches of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) shall
be an amount equal to $60,000,000.

(iii) Subject to Section 8.7, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses that
an Indemnifying Party shall be liable for, or that may be recovered by an
Indemnified Party, in the aggregate pursuant to this Agreement shall be the
Final Purchase Price.

 

(iv) Any amounts recoverable from Seller as the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) (other than with respect to Seller Fundamental Representations
and Seller Special Representations) shall first be satisfied from the funds
available in the Escrow Account.

 

(d) _Insurance and Other Payments; Tax Benefits_. Payments by an Indemnifying
Party pursuant to Section 7.1, Section 7.2, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 in
respect of any Loss (i) shall be limited to the amount of any Liability that
remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or similar payment (in each case, net of costs of collection or
recovery and in the case of insurance, net of any increase in premium)
actually received by the Indemnified Party (or its Subsidiaries) under
insurance policies or from third parties (other than the Indemnifying Party)
in respect of any such claim and (ii) shall be reduced to take account of any
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from such Loss
(determined on a with and without basis) in the year the Loss is incurred or
the indemnity payment is made. Prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to make a claim for any Losses which may be reasonably recoverable under any
insurance policies. Other than with respect to the RandW Insurance Policy as
set forth in Section 8.4(c), it is not a requirement that the Indemnified
Party make any recovery under any insurance policy prior to seeking or
obtaining indemnification under this Agreement. In the event that an
insurance payment or any indemnity, contribution or similar payment is
received by the Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which it has
been indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of such payment (net of costs of collection or recovery and
in the case of insurance, net of any increase in premium) shall be paid
promptly in immediately available funds to the Indemnifying Party that
provided such indemnification to the Indemnified Party. Other than with
respect to the obligations set forth in Section 8.4(c), none of Purchasers,
the Conveyed Entities and the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be required to
institute any litigation to obtain insurance proceeds. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the obligations,
deductions, refunds, mitigation or restrictions related to insurance or
recovery of claims or any other limitations set forth in this Section
8.4(d), Section 8.9 or this Article VIII shall apply to any environmental
insurance coverage contained in any insurance policy owned, procured or
maintained by any Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

 



99 (e) _Additional Environmental Limitations_. In addition to, and without in any
way limiting, any other limitations that may apply, no Losses may be asserted
or recovered under Section 8.2 for any investigation, remediation or
corrective action to any contamination or other condition arising from
Materials of Environmental Concern at any Real Property, to the extent such
investigation, remediation or corrective action (i) is not required by
applicable Environmental Law; (ii) is not the most cost-effective means of
investigating, remediating or undertaking corrective action regarding such
contamination or other condition permitted by applicable Environmental Law for
the continued use of such Real Property as such Real Property was used on or
prior to the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, if the means
of investigating or remediation is not the most cost-effective means, then
Seller shall be liable for Losses up to the most cost-effective means and
Purchaser shall be responsible for any Losses in excess of the most cost-
effective means); (iii) results from any change in use of such Real Property
or any portion thereof on or after the Closing Date from industrial or
commercial use; or (iv) results from any breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ of
this Agreement.

 

(f) _No Duplication_. The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover
more than once for the same Loss.

 

(g) _Other Matters_. No indemnity may be sought hereunder in respect of any
Loss to the extent such Loss (but only to the extent that the amount of such
Loss) is reflected in the calculations of the Closing Indebtedness and the
Closing Working Capital, in each case as finally determined in connection with
the Final Purchase Price.

 

Section 8.5. _Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of determining whether
there has been a breach of a representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement (other than a breach of the representations and warranties in
Section 3.7(b) and the second sentence of Section 3.18(a)), the Seller
Documents, the Purchaser Documents or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by or on behalf of any Party pursuant to this Agreement
or the Closing Agreements (other than the Transition Services Agreement) and
determining the amount of Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for
indemnification related thereto, each such representation and warranty, shall
be read without regard and without giving effect to the terms "material,"
"Material Adverse Effect," "material adverse effect," or other variations of
the words "material" or "material adverse effect" contained in such
representation or warranty (as if such words, phrases and related clauses were
deleted from such representation and warranty and, in the case of "Material
Adverse Effect" or "material adverse effect," as if such words read as
"adverse effect").

Section 8.6.  _Representations_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the representations and warranties of Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries contained in Article III of this Agreement and the
representations and warranties of Purchaser and Guarantor contained in
Article IV of this Agreement shall, for purposes of the Indemnifying Parties
obligations and the Indemnified Parties rights pursuant to this Article VIII,
be deemed to be made as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly
speaks of an earlier date, which shall be deemed to be made as of such date)
without regard to the exceptions set forth in the duly executed officers
certificates referenced in Section 6.2(c) and Section 6.3(c), but subject to
any exceptions set forth in the applicable part(s) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter as of the date of the execution of this Agreement or
Purchaser Disclosure Letter as of the date of this Agreement, as applicable.

 



100 Section 8.7. _No Limitations for Fraud or Willful Breach_ _; Other
Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit any remedy of any Party for
fraud or willful breach of this Agreement (it being understood that any fraud
or willful breach on the part of any employee, officer or director of any
Party shall be deemed to be fraud or willful breach of such Party).

Section 8.8.  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of any Action made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ ") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written certificate (any
certificate delivered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.8(a)
or (f), a " _Claim Certificate_ ") to the Indemnifying Party of the Third-
Party Claim promptly (but in no event more than twenty (20) calendar days)
after becoming aware of the Third-Party Claim and each such Claim Certificate
shall describe in reasonable detail the applicable Third-Party Claim and
identify the provisions of this Agreement upon which such Claim Certificate is
made and, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, the facts giving
rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder and the amount or a good
faith estimate of the potential Losses for which the Indemnified Party is
seeking indemnification under this Agreement (the " _Losses Estimate_ ");
_provided_ that the failure to so notify an Indemnifying Party promptly
(and in any event within twenty (20) calendar days) shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or
such failure to give timely notice actually and materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Partys defense of such claim.

(b) Within twenty (20) days after delivery of such Claim Certificate, the
Indemnifying Party may elect (by written notice delivered to the Indemnified
Party) to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, at its sole cost and
expense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified
Party) if (i) the Third-Party Claim relates to any Action of a criminal
nature; (ii) the Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party; (iii) the amount in dispute, when taken
together with all other outstanding claims for indemnification by the
Indemnified Parties, would reasonably be expected to exceed the maximum
amount for which the Indemnifying Party can be liable pursuant to this Article
VIII in light of the limitations set forth in this Article VIII; or (iv) the
Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing that it is obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to, and subject to the limitations
set forth in, this Article VIII with respect to such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party properly assumes the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense and the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this
Article VIII for any fees or expenses of other counsel incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third-Party
Claim during such period that the Indemnifying Party has so assumed such
defense (it being understood, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in all negotiations and proceedings related to the
Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense); _provided_ , _however_ , if,
in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel for

 



101  such Indemnified Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of an actual
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel of its own choosing (plus one local
counsel) at the Indemnifying Partys expense. If the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in this Section
8.8(b), and the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
adequately defend such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume its
own defense and seek indemnification from the Indemnifying Party for
all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection with such
defense.

(c) If (i) the Indemnifying Party does not provide written notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume such Third-Party Claim within such
twenty (20) day period or (ii) the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
handle the prosecution or defense of such Third-Party Claim and will permit
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, to
participate in such prosecution or defense and will provide the
Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to all relevant information and
documentation relating to the Third-Party Claim and the prosecution or defense
thereof. If the Indemnified Party proceeds with the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, all fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
relating to the defense of such Third-Party Claim shall be deemed to be Losses
for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(d) The Indemnifying Party will not pay, or permit to be paid, or compromise
or settle or admit any Liability with respect to any part of the Third-Party
Claim, unless the Indemnified Party consents in writing to such payment,
unless (i) the relief for such Third-Party Claim consists solely of money
damages and such settlement does not provide for injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief or otherwise require the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates to perform any covenant or refrain from engaging in any activity,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party will satisfy in full all monetary Liability and
damages due to the applicable third-party claimant or plaintiff immediately
upon such settlement, (iii) such compromise or settlement includes a full
general, unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates
by all parties to the matter from all Liability with respect to such Third-
Party Claim and (iv) such settlement would not create any Liability or
financial or other obligation on the part of any Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates. If any Indemnifying Party is entitled to assume the defense
of a Third-Party Claim under Section 8.8(b) and does not assume such defense
or is not permitted to assume the defense pursuant to Section 8.8(b)(i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) (or elects to assume such defense but subsequently fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to adequately maintain such defense), then the
Indemnified Party may compromise or settle or admit any Liability with respect
to any part of such Third-Party Claim without the prior consent of the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , if Indemnifying Party is (A) not
permitted to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section
8.8(b)(i) or (b)(ii) and the proposed settlement results in any of
the following: (x) any criminal liability for any Indemnifying Party, (y)
equitable relief against any Indemnifying Party or (z) any Liability for any
Indemnifying Party in an amount greater than zero but less than 150% of the
then remaining amount for which the Indemnifying Party can be liable pursuant
to this Article VIII after application of the limitations on indemnification
contained in this Article VIII, if applicable, or (B) not permitted to assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.8(b)(iii) and the
proposed settlement is an amount greater than zero but less than 150% of the
then remaining amount for which the Indemnifying

 



102  Party can be liable pursuant to this Article VIII after application of the
limitations on indemnification contained in this Article VIII, if applicable,
then, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), (I) the Indemnified Party shall not
compromise or settle or admit any Liability with respect to any part of such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and (II) the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify
and hold harmless the Indemnified Party for any such compromise, settlement or
judgment entered into with the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 8.8(b), during the time period
the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party will not pay, or permit to be paid, or compromise or
settle or admit any Liability with respect to any part of such Third-Party
Claim without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(e) In all cases, each Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall provide
its reasonable cooperation in defense of claims or litigation relating to
Third-Party Claims, including by providing each other with reasonable access
to relevant books, records and documentation. If the party in control of the
prosecution or defense of a Third-Party Claim shall not reasonably promptly
assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, or fails to diligently and
vigorously prosecute or defend or withdraws from the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim, the other party may defend against such matter in a manner
consistent with the provisions of this Section 8.8.

(f) In the event that an Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for
payment of Losses by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement (other than as a result of a Third-Party Claim),
the Indemnified Party shall promptly (but in no event more than twenty (20)
calendar days) deliver a Claim Certificate for such claim to the Indemnifying
Party and such Claim Certificate shall identify the provisions of this
Agreement upon which such Claim Certificate is made, describe in reasonable
detail, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, the facts giving
rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder and the Losses Estimate;
_provided_ that the failure to so notify an Indemnifying Party promptly (and
in any event within twenty (20) calendar days) shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or
such failure to give timely notice actually and materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Partys defense of such claim. At any time prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period, any Claim Certificate delivered
by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 8.8(f) or Section 8.8(a) may
be supplemented by such Indemnified Party to the extent such supplement
relates to the same facts and circumstances of the original Claim Certificate,
and such supplement shall be effective as of the date of the original notice.

 

(g) Any claim for indemnity with respect to the ISRA Work or the Pending ISRA
Proceeding for the property on which the Sayreville mini-mill is located
shall first be satisfied through the release of funds remaining in the
Remediation Funding Source described in Section 5.14(a) and Section 5.14(b),
and next through the release of funds remaining in the escrow to be
established as described in Section 5.14(b). Such claims shall follow the
procedures applicable to the Remediation Funding Source or set forth in the
escrow agreement related to such escrow and shall not be subject to the
provisions of this Section 8.8 unless and until there are no longer funds
remaining in such Remediation Funding Source or such escrow.

 



103 Section 8.9. _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses promptly after becoming aware of
any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder, in each case, to the same extent as it would if
such Loss was not subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII.

Section 8.10. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Parties agree
that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 8.11. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
Section 2.8, Section 5.8, Section 5.9(d), Section 5.19(c), Article VII and
Section 8.7, from and after the Closing, the indemnification provided in this
Article VIII, subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the
exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any party in connection with any
Losses arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, Seller Documents or in
any certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of Seller or any
Selling Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or the Purchaser Documents
or in any certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of Purchasers
pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable (in each case, other than the
Transition Services Agreement). The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing in this
Article VIII shall limit or restrict the ability or right of any Party hereto
to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for any breach or alleged breach
of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, from and
after the Closing, any procedures in respect of and limitations on Losses or
Liabilities in this Article VIII shall in no event be diminished or
circumvented by such relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it and
any of the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees may not avoid any
limitation on Liability by (a) seeking damages for breach of contract or tort
or pursuant to any other theory of Liability, all of which are hereby waived,
or (b) asserting or threatening any claim against any Person that is not a
party hereto (or a successor to a Party hereto) for breaches of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. EACH
PARTY AND EACH OF THE PURCHASER INDEMNITEES AND THE SELLER INDEMNITEES
EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE THAT LIMITS THE EFFECT OF
A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH PARTY AND EACH OF THE PURCHASER
INDEMNITEES AND THE SELLER INDEMNITEES UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A
RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH OF THE PURCHASER INDEMNITEES AND THE SELLER
INDEMNITEES ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL AND
MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT. The Parties hereto agree that the provisions
in this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on the
Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees remedies with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including Section
8.4), were specifically bargained for among sophisticated Parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to Seller hereunder.

 



104 Section 8.12. _No Punitive Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF
THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS,
LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY PURSUANT
TO THIS AGREEMENT;  _PROVIDED_ THAT THIS SECTION 8.12 SHALL NOT LIMIT
INDEMNIFICATION FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES PAID OR PAYABLE TO A THIRD PARTY.

 

Section 8.13. _No Contribution_. No Seller, Selling Subsidiary or other Seller
Indemnitee shall have, and no such Person shall exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity
or other right or remedy against any Conveyed Entity in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which such
Seller, Selling Subsidiary or other Seller Indemnitee may become subject or
which may be payable out of the Escrow Amount or otherwise in connection with

ARTICLE IX

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned, at any time
prior to the Closing as follows:

(a) by written agreement of Purchasers and Seller;

 

(b) by either Purchasers or Seller, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior
to 5:30 P.M., Eastern Time, on December 29, 2018 (the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if on the initial End Date, the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(b) (with respect to the HSR Act) or Section 6.1(a) (as a
result of a challenge to the transactions contemplated hereby under the
Antitrust Laws) are not satisfied, but all other conditions to the Closing set
forth in Article VI are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to those
conditions being capable of being satisfied), then Seller or Purchasers may,
by providing written notice to the other prior to 5:30 P.M., Eastern Time, on
such initial End Date, extend the End Date to March 29, 2019, in which case
the End Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be such later date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither Seller nor Purchasers may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ if it is in breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, including such Partys failure to satisfy any condition to the
Closing that is within the control of such Party, and such breach causes, or
results in, either (i) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the
obligations of the terminating Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement set forth in Article VI prior to the End Date
or (ii) the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to the End Date;

(c) by either Purchasers or Seller, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
competent Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law then in effect, issued an Order or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a) would not be satisfied, and such Law,
Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(c) shall have complied in all material respects with
its obligations under Section 5.3 and Section 5.4;

 



105 (d) by written notice from Purchasers following a breach of any covenant or
agreement of Seller or any Selling Subsidiary contained in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of Seller or any Selling Subsidiary
contained in this Agreement shall be or shall have become inaccurate, in
either case, such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) and
Section 6.2(b) is incapable of being satisfied, and such breach or inaccuracy
is not cured as of the earlier of (i) the End Date and (ii) thirty (30) days
after written notice of such breach from Purchasers is received by Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to Purchasers if they or
Guarantor is then in material breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(e) by written notice from Seller following a breach of any covenant or
agreement of Purchasers contained in this Agreement, or if any representation
or warranty of Purchasers contained in this Agreement shall be or shall have
become inaccurate, in either such case, such that any of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) is incapable of being
satisfied, and such breach or inaccuracy is not cured as of the earlier of (i)
the End Date and (ii) thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach
from Seller is received by Purchasers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) shall not be
available to Seller, if Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or the Conveyed
Entities are then in material breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(f) by written notice from Purchasers to Seller given at any time prior to
Closing if there shall have occurred a Material Adverse Effect and such
Material Adverse Effect is not cured as of the earlier of (i) the End Date and
(ii) thirty (30) days after written notice of such Material Adverse Effect
from Purchasers is received by Seller.

Section 9.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 9.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect,
and no Party shall have any Liability to the other Party or their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers or employees except for the obligations of the
Parties contained in this Section 9.2 and in Section 5.1 (Information and
Documents), Sections 5.19(b) and (c) (Cooperation with Financing), and Article
X (other than Sections 10.2 (Joinder) and 10.17 (Release)) and except that
nothing herein will relieve any Party from Liability for any willful and
material breach of any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement prior to such termination. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"willful and material breach" shall mean an act or a failure to act, which act
or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and which
act or failure to act was undertaken with the actual knowledge that such act
or failure to act would be a breach of this Agreement.

 



106 (b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 9.2 shall
be deemed to affect their respective rights to specific performance under
Section 10.14, including Sellers or Purchasers right to specifically enforce
the other Partys obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with Section 10.14.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i)(A) by either Seller or
Purchasers pursuant to Section 9.1(b), (B) by either Seller or Purchasers
pursuant to Section 9.1(c) and such Law, Order or other action giving rise to
such termination is with respect to any Antitrust Law; or (C) by Seller
pursuant to Section 9.1(e) based on a failure by Purchasers to perform their
covenants or agreements under Section 5.4, and (ii) in each case of the
foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), at the time of such termination, all other
conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 6.2(a), Section 6.2(b) and
Section 6.2(d) shall have been satisfied or waived (except for (I) those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing but which
conditions would be satisfied or would be capable of being satisfied if the
Closing Date were the date of termination or (II) those conditions that have
not been satisfied as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Purchasers),
then Purchasers shall pay to Seller a fee of $40 million (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such payment to be
made within two (2) Business Days of the applicable termination.

 

(d) Each of Seller and each Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Solely for the purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any way
increasing or decreasing the amount of the Termination Fee or expanding or
limiting the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid, each of
Seller and Purchasers further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by
Purchasers specified in this Section 9.2 is not a penalty, but, in each case,
is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Seller and
the Selling Subsidiaries in the circumstances in which such amounts are
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If
Purchasers fail to promptly pay the Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Seller commences a suit that results in a judgment against
Purchasers for the Termination Fee, or any portion thereof, Purchasers shall
pay to Seller its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and the fees and expenses of any expert or consultant engaged by Seller) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such
payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition in effect on the date of such payment.

 

(e) The Parties agree and understand that in no event shall Purchasers be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
Seller actually receives the Termination Fee from Purchasers pursuant to this
Section 9.2, (i) such payment (and any amounts payable pursuant to Section
9.2(d)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries against any Purchaser, Guarantor and their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members, Affiliates, Financing Sources and Representatives and none of

 



107  any Purchaser, Guarantor, or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates, Financing Sources or Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) under no circumstances shall Seller
be entitled or permitted to receive monetary damages (including the payment
of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.2) for any breach by
Purchasers of Section 5.4 of this Agreement in excess of the Termination Fee
(and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.2(d)). Until such time
as Purchasers or Guarantor pays the Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 9.2, nothing in this Section 9.2(e) shall prohibit or restrain Seller
or any Selling Subsidiary from its right to obtain specific performance
pursuant to Section 10.14.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Seller
Related Party shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source
(solely in its capacity as a Financing Source) in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and no Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any Seller
Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that, following occurrence of the
Closing, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the
Financing under any Debt Commitment Letter related thereto to the extent
relating solely to the Conveyed Entities and the Purchased Assets only (and
not in any event to Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries).

without obtaining the prior written approval of the non-disclosing Party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
except that no Party shall be required to obtain the approval of the other

proposed release or announcement includes information that has previously
been made public without breach of the obligations under this Section 10.7.

Section 10.8. _Expenses_. The IT Transition Costs shall be borne (a) solely

up to $4,000,000 and (c) by Seller for IT Transition Costs in excess of
$4,000,000. The filing fees under the HSR Act shall be borne equally by

Section 10.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Limitation
of Liability_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all actions, causes of action, claims, cross-claims,
third-party claims or Actions of any kind (whether at Law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), any
certificate, instrument, opinion or other documents delivered hereunder or
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof (including any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, third-party claim or Action of
any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith) shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state.

 

(b) With respect to any Action, each Party irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees and consents, for itself and its property, to be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State
of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action, cause
of action,

 



111  claim, cross-claim or Action of any kind arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any certificate, instrument, opinion or other documents delivered
hereunder or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof
(including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or Action of any
kind based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty
made in or in connection herewith or therewith), or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or Action of any kind shall be

of any kind arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any certificate,
instrument, opinion or other documents delivered hereunder or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof (including any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or Action of any kind based upon, arising
out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection
herewith or therewith) in the Delaware Court of Chancery, any federal court of
the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware or in any
Delaware State court; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or Action of any kind in any such court; and
(iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or Action of any kind may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. The foregoing
consent to jurisdiction shall not constitute general consent to service of
process in the State of Delaware for any purpose except as provided above and
shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the respective
Parties to this Agreement. Each of Seller and each Purchaser irrevocably
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by United
States registered mail to such Partys address set forth above shall be
effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware
with respect to any matters for which it has submitted to
jurisdiction pursuant to this Section 10.9(b).

(c) EACH OF EACH PURCHASER, SELLER AND EACH SELLING SUBSIDIARY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND
(WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) AS AMONG THE
PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES HERETO), ANY CERTIFICATE,
INSTRUMENT, OPINION OR OTHER DOCUMENTS DELIVERED HEREUNDER OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF (INCLUDING ANY ACTION,
CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION BASED
UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN
OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, THE FINANCING OR
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM

 



112  AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE, OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, INCLUDING IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER
AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF EACH PURCHASER,
SELLER AND EACH SELLING SUBSIDIARY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT, FINANCING SOURCE OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER; (III) MAKES SUCH
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.9(c).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Seller Related Party
and each of the other parties hereto (a) agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources (in their capacity

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited
to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the
performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County
of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in
the federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (b) submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts, (c) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or
document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section
10.1 shall be effective service of process against it for any such action
brought in any such court, (d) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (e) agrees that
a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by law; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and
agreed that (i) the interpretation of the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" (and whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (ii) the
determination of the accuracy of any Specified Representations (or similar
term as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter in respect of the Conveyed
Entities and the Purchased Assets) and whether as a result thereof Purchasers
have the right (taking into account any applicable cure provisions) to
terminate their obligations under this Agreement or decline to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) the determination of whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been consummated in
accordance with their terms, in each case, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern the applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

(e) No Financing Source shall be subject to any special, consequential,
punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature.

 



113 Section 10.10. _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile or Email_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and any amendment, restatement, supplement or other
modification hereto or waiver hereunder, (i) may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email in .pdf format), each
of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and
the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart, and (ii)
to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or scanned
pages via email, shall be treated in all manner and respect as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.

 

(b) At the request of any Party hereto, each other Party hereto shall re-
execute original forms hereof and of any Closing Agreement and deliver them
to all other Parties. No Party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile
machine or email as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such
Party forever waives any such defense.

 

Section 10.11. _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

Section 10.12. _No Strict Construction_. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by all Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.13. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 10.14. _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that the other Parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms
and that any breach of this Agreement by a Party would not be
adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to
any other right or remedy to which any Party may be entitled under this
Agreement, at law or in equity, each Party shall be entitled to enforce any
provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive

 



114  relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions
of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking (unless such
requirement is not permitted to be waived under applicable Law). If any Party
brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement by any other party in accordance with this
Section 10.14, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount
of time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days,
or (y) such other time period established by the Delaware court presiding over
such Action.

 

Section 10.15. _Representation of Seller_. Purchasers hereby waive and agree
to not assert, and agree to cause the Conveyed Entities to waive and not
assert, any actual or potential conflict of interest arising out of or
relating to the representation, on or after the Closing Date, of Seller or any
of its Affiliates in any dispute with Purchasers or any Conveyed Entity
involving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by Simpson Thacher
and Bartlett LLP (" _Simpson_ ") in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, even though the interests of such Person(s)
may be directly adverse to Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (including,
from and after the Closing, the Conveyed Entities) and even though Simpson may
have represented the Conveyed Entities in a matter substantially related to
such dispute. Purchasers and the Conveyed Entities also further agree that,
as to all communications among Simpson and the Conveyed Entities, Seller or
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives that relate in any way to
this Agreement, the negotiation thereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence
belongs to Seller and shall be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Conveyed Entities). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
attorney-client privilege, attorney-work product protection and client
confidence shall also belong to and also be controlled by the Conveyed
Entities and shall be deemed passed to and claimed by the Conveyed Entities
after the Closing (i) in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (including, from and after the
Closing, the Conveyed Entities), on the one hand, and a third party other
than (and not an Affiliate of) a Party to this Agreement, on the other hand or
(ii) to the extent any such attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection or client confidence is required to be waived or otherwise
required to be similarly released by any Governmental Authority, and, in any
such case, Purchasers and the Conveyed Entities shall not be in breached or
violation of any provision of this Agreement or any Closing Agreement
for providing any information, documents, communications or client
confidences to any Governmental Authority in response to, and subject to the
limitation in, the foregoing. Purchasers acknowledge that they have consulted
with independent counsel of their own choosing with respect to the meaning
and effect of this Section 10.15.

Section 10.16. _Purchaser Guarantee_. Guarantor, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, absolutely, fully, irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees the full and timely payment and performance of and agrees to cause
Purchasers to perform, and shall be jointly and severally liable with
Purchasers for the full and timely payment and performance of, the obligations
of Purchasers (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ") when due and payable or
required to be performed, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement
and the Purchaser Documents. This is a guarantee of payment and performance
and not of collectability. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Section
10.16 are primary, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable in respect of
satisfying the Guaranteed Obligations and shall be enforceable against
Guarantor to the same extent as if

 



115  Guarantor were the primary obligor (and not merely a surety) under this
Agreement and the Purchaser Documents. It shall not be necessary for Seller
(and Guarantor hereby waives any rights that Guarantor may have to require
Seller), in order to enforce the obligations of Guarantor hereunder, first to
(a) institute suit or exhaust its remedies against Purchasers; (b) join
Purchasers or any other Person in any action seeking to enforce any such
agreement; or (c) resort to any other means of obtaining payment or
enforcement of the obligations of Purchasers; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, any defenses or counterclaims that would be available to
any Purchaser shall be available to Guarantor hereunder (other than to the
extent expressly waived in this Section 10.16 or otherwise arising from any
insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment, composition or liquidation of
any Purchaser). Seller shall not be required to take any action to reduce,
collect or enforce the obligations of Purchasers when due under this Agreement
or any Purchaser Document prior to reducing, collecting or enforcing against
Guarantor with respect to Guarantors obligations hereunder. With respect to
the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor waives notice of protest, proof of non-
payment, default or breach by Purchasers, promptness, diligence, notice
of acceptance of this guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of any Guaranteed Obligations
incurred, all defenses that may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect. Guarantor
agrees to each of the following, and agrees that its obligations under this
Agreement and the Purchaser Documents as a result of this Section 10.16 shall
not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced or adversely affected by any
of the following, and waives any common law, equitable, statutory or other
rights (except to the extent required pursuant to this Agreement or any
Closing Agreement) that Guarantor might otherwise have as a result of or
in connection with (i) any renewal, extension, increase, modification,
alteration or rearrangement of all or any part of the obligations of any
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any Purchaser Document; (ii) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment, composition, liquidation,
disability, dissolution, asset sale or transfer or change of structure,
ownership or organization of any Purchaser; (iii) the failure or delay on the
part of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
remedy against any Purchaser; or (iv) the adequacy of any other means Seller
may have of obtaining payment related to any of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Closing
Agreements. The guarantee set forth in this Section 10.16 is a continuing and
absolute guarantee, and it and the Guaranteed Obligations will not be
discharged, and will remain in full force and effect, until the full payment
and performance of all amounts required to be paid and performed by Purchasers
pursuant to this Agreement and the Purchaser Documents.

 

Section 10.17. _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each Selling
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and each Conveyed Entity, on the other hand, on
their own behalf, and on behalf of their respective legal representatives and
successors and assigns and, with respect to each Selling Subsidiary, on behalf
of their respective Affiliates (the " _Releasing Persons_ "), hereby
releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the other, and each of their respective current, former or future
employees, directors, agents, equity holders, officers, managers, partners,
Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, in such capacities, the "
_Released Persons_ "), of, from and against any and all Actions and
Liabilities, whether at law or in equity, that such Selling Subsidiary or such
Conveyed Entity, or their respective Releasing Persons ever had, now has or
may hereafter have against any of the Released Persons, by reason of any
matter, cause or thing relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, the 

 



116  Conveyed Entities or the Conveyed Entities Equity Interests occurring at any
time on or prior to the Closing, but only to the extent that such cause,
matter or thing does not otherwise constitute fraud by any Person other than
a Conveyed Entity. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 10.17 to
the contrary, the release set forth in this Section 10.17 shall not affect or
release (i) any claims or rights under this Agreement, the Closing Agreements
and the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) any matters set forth in Articles VII
and VIII, subject to the provisions and limitations contained in Articles VII
and VIII, respectively, (iii) any rights, following the Closing, to receive
payments pursuant to this Agreement or any rights pursuant to Section 5.8, and
(iv) with respect to the Released Persons who are or were employees, officers
or directors of the Business, solely with respect to their participation in
the Business Benefit Plans, any rights under any Business Benefit Plan.
