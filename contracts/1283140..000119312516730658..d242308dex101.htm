by the Partnership and its Affiliates) are in full force and effect, all
premiums with respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the
Closing Date have been paid, and no written notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any such policy. Such policies,
including without limitation products liability insurance, (a) are sufficient
for compliance in all material respects with all requirements of Applicable
Law and of all Material Contracts for matters covered by such policies, and
(b) are, to the Knowledge of Seller, valid policies, enforceable against the

terms, except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent

Executive Director of the Utah Dept. of Envtl. Quality, et al.,_ No.
20150344-SC, or implementing administrative order of the Utah Division of Air
Quality ("DAQ") (collectively, the "Permit Appeal Proceedings") to include a
Shutdown Condition by reason of the Permit Appeal Proceedings, and thereafter
as a direct result of the Permit Appeal Proceedings the Assets are Idled for
ninety (90) or more days (whether or not consecutive) (such ninetieth day
being referred to hereinafter as the "Reference Date"), then Buyer shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to require Seller to, and Seller shall,
purchase all, and not less than all, of the LLC Interest (the "Put Right").
Such Put Right shall be exercised, if at all, by Buyer delivering an
unconditional written notice of exercise to Seller (the "Put Notice") at any
time prior to the date on which the Assets are no longer Idled after the
Reference Date. The closing of the LLC Interest purchase pursuant to this
_Section 8.4(a)_ (the "Put Sale") shall be accomplished as provided in
_Section 8.4(c)_.

Tolling Agreement) for the Assets, as set forth in the Amended and Restated
Master Tolling Agreement, shall be extended by the number of days that the

Amended and Restated Master Tolling Agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Parties.

operating expenses payable on and after the consummation of

 



11  the Put Sale that relates to the Interim Period and which are for the
account of Buyer as provided in this _Section 8.4(c)_. Seller shall be
responsible for and shall timely pay any and all expenses associated with the
Permit Appeal Proceedings or addressing a Shutdown Condition. Regardless of
whether the Assets are Idled, Seller will provide and Buyer will pay for any
required Services (as defined in the Amended and Restated Services and
Secondment Agreement) and Service Items (as defined in the Amended and
Restated Master Site Services Agreement) for the Assets pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Services and Secondment
Agreement and the Amended and Restated Master Site Services Agreement (the

reimbursement of Services Fee Damages as contemplated by _Section 8.4(d)_.

 

(d) The closing of the Put Sale shall take place on the date designated in
writing by Seller, which date shall be not more than 90 days nor less than
five days after the delivery of the Put Notice. At the closing of the Put
Sale, (i) Seller shall acquire all of the LLC Interest, (ii) Buyer shall be
entitled to receive, in cash, from Seller the Purchase Price and Services Fee

behalf of Buyer to Seller or Sellers Affiliates, and Buyer shall be relieved
of any obligation to pay Services Fee Damages that have not already been paid
by or on behalf of Buyer to Seller or Sellers Affiliates, (iii) Buyer and
Seller shall execute such documents and instruments, and take such further
actions, as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to effectuate the Put
Sale; provided, however, that, in connection therewith, Buyer shall make to
Seller only those representations and warranties that were made by Seller to
Buyer in this Agreement and are contained in _Article IV_ except that the
developments in the Permit Appeal Proceedings and any Interim Period Buyer
Event (which does not result in a Shutdown Condition independent of the Permit
Appeal Proceedings) shall be permitted exceptions; and provided further, that
except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of the definition of Seller
Indemnified Costs, Buyer shall provide indemnification to Seller in respect of
the foregoing representations and warranties that are no more onerous to Buyer
than the indemnification in _Article IX_ is to Seller; and provided further,
that Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify Seller in respect of the
foregoing representations and warranties if such representations or warranties
were incorrect when made by Seller to Buyer at the Closing, and (iv) Buyer
and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective applicable Affiliates to,
amend the Ancillary Documents as appropriate and in good faith to reflect that
the LLC Interest has been repurchased by Seller.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants
in this _Section 8.4_ shall survive in accordance with their terms.

(f) This _Section 8.4_ shall terminate and cease to apply if, following
completion of the Permit Appeal Proceedings, (i) the Utah Permit is upheld or
(ii) the Utah Permit is not upheld by the Utah Supreme Court, but is amended,
supplemented or modified without any Shutdown Condition.

 

(g) If the Put Right is not exercised by Buyer and, by reason of the Permit
Appeal Proceedings, the Assets must be modified to allow the Assets to
operate in compliance with the Utah Permit, as modified in the Permit Appeal
Proceedings, Seller shall be responsible for such costs reasonably incurred to
allow the Assets to be operated in compliance with the requirements set forth
in the Utah Permit as so modified.

 



12 8.5. Utah Permit Information; Notification. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed regarding any pending Action involving the Permit Appeal
Proceedings, including with regard to the timeline, rulings, motions and other
material events occurring in connection with the Permit Appeal Proceedings.
Additionally, Seller, at Sellers expense, shall make reasonably available to
Buyer the advisors that have been engaged by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection with the Permit Appeal Proceedings. If, as a result of the Permit
Appeal Proceedings, the Assets are Idled, Seller shall provide Buyer with a
plan to remedy such condition. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
8.5_, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to disclose
any information to Buyer if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to (a)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (b) contravene any
Laws, ethical rules, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date hereof.

 

8.6. Temporary Transition Services. In consideration of the Purchase Price,
and to the extent requested by Buyer, Seller will perform all
responsibilities under the license for the stationary level gauge located in
the FCC Unit 2 Assets as required by applicable law and permits until Buyer
has obtained and provided evidence to Seller that Buyer has obtained all
necessary regulatory approvals, certificates and permits required under
applicable law for such gauge. Buyer shall promptly apply for and diligently
pursue the issuance to Buyer of such approvals, certificates and permits under
applicable law.

"), of the commencement or assertion of any action, proceeding, demand, or
claim by a third party (collectively, a " _third- party action_") in respect
of which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder. Any failure
so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any liability that it, he, or she may have to such Indemnified Party
under this  _Article IX_ unless the failure to give such notice materially
and adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to assume control of the defense of, settle, or otherwise
dispose of such third-party action on such terms as it deems appropriate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that:

(a) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such third-party action ( _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the attorneys fees of the Indemnified
Party if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such
third-party action, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to have charge of
such third-party action, (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be defenses available to such Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party,
or (iv) the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified
Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there
is a material conflict of interest that could violate applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel);

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of such third-party action or any
liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such

 



13  settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if, in the
opinion of the Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment could have a Material Adverse Effect on its business, or, in
the case of Buyer, is the result of an Interim Period Buyer Event;

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of
a release from all liability in respect of such third-party action; and

 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any third-party action
(i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense within
a reasonable length of time or (ii) to the extent the third-party action
seeks an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business,
operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement,
compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on
the part of any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such
Indemnifying Party.

The Parties shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the defense
of any third-party action pursuant to this _Article IX_ and, in connection
therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and appeals as may
be reasonably requested.

 

9.3. Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to  _Section 9.2_ because no
third-party action is involved, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnified Costs which such Indemnified
Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. Subject
to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.4(a)_, the failure of the
Indemnified Party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount
to a waiver of such claim unless the resulting delay materially
prejudices the position of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.

9.4. Limitations. The following provisions of this  _Section 9.4_ shall
limit the indemnification obligations hereunder:

(a) Limitation as to Time. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
Indemnified Costs pursuant to this _Article IX_ unless a written claim for
indemnification in accordance with _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ is given

before 5:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the first anniversary of the Closing

(b) Any Party may at any time change its address for service from time to time
by giving notice to the other Parties in accordance with this  _Section

16 10.3. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under Applicable Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein
are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

10.4. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall
be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding
any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might refer the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of another state. Each Party
hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the
State of Texas and to venue in Dallas, Texas. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

10.5. Arbitration Provision. Any and all Arbitrable Disputes must be resolved
through the use of binding arbitration using three arbitrators, in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,
as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal
questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code).
If there is any inconsistency between this _Section 10.5_ and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this _Section
10.5_ will control the rights and obligations of the Parties. Arbitration
must be initiated within the time limits set forth in this Agreement, or if no
such limits apply, then within a reasonable time or the time period allowed by
the applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration may be initiated by a
Party ("Claimant") serving written notice on the other Party ("Respondent")
that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to binding
arbitration. Claimants notice initiating binding arbitration must identify
the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. The Respondent shall respond to
Claimant within thirty (30) days after receipt of Claimants notice,
identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. If the Respondent fails
for any reason to name an arbitrator within the 30-day period, Claimant shall
petition the American Arbitration Association for appointment of an arbitrator
for Respondents account. The two arbitrators so chosen shall select a third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the second arbitrator has been
appointed. The Claimant will pay the compensation and expenses of the
arbitrator named by it, and the Respondent will pay the compensation and
expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it. The costs of petitioning for
the appointment of an arbitrator, if any, shall be paid by Respondent. The
Claimant and Respondent will each pay one-half of the compensation and
expenses of the third arbitrator. All arbitrators must (i) be neutral parties
who have never been officers, directors or employees of Seller, Buyer or any
of their Affiliates and (ii) have not less than seven (7) years experience in
the petroleum transportation industry. The hearing will be conducted in
Dallas, Texas and commence within thirty (30) days after the selection of the
third arbitrator. Seller, Buyer and the arbitrators shall proceed diligently
and in good faith in order that the award may be made as promptly as possible.
Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the
arbitrators will be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties hereto. The
arbitrators shall have no right to grant or award indirect, consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages of any kind. The Arbitrable Disputes may be
arbitrated in a common proceeding along with disputes under other agreements
between Seller, Buyer or their Affiliates to the extent that the issues raised
in such disputes are related. Without the written consent of the Parties, no
unrelated disputes or third party disputes may be joined to an arbitration
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



17 10.6. Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party and their successors and permitted
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement. 

10.7. Assignment of Agreement. At any time, the Parties may make a collateral
assignment of their rights under this Agreement to any of their bona fide
lenders or debt holders, or a trustee or a representative for any of them, and
the non-assigning Parties shall execute an acknowledgment of such collateral
assignment in such form as may from time to time be reasonably requested;
_provided, however_ , that unless written notice is given to the non-assigning
Parties that any such collateral assignment has been foreclosed upon, such
non-assigning Parties shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Seller or
HFC, as the case may be, as to any matters arising under this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents or the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (other than
for delivery of notices required by any such collateral assignment). Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 10.7_, neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

 

10.8. Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for purposes of reference
only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the interpretation hereof.

10.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

10.10. Director and Officer Liability. The directors, managers, officers,
partners and stockholders of HFC, Buyer, Seller and their respective
Affiliates shall not have any personal liability or obligation arising under
this Agreement (including any claims that another party may assert) other
than, if applicable, as a direct party to or as an assignee of this Agreement
or pursuant to a written guarantee.

10.11. Integration. This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Amended
and Restated Omnibus Agreement supersede any previous understandings or
agreements among the Parties, whether oral or written, with respect to their
subject matter. This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Amended and
Restated Omnibus Agreement contain the entire understanding of the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. No understanding,
representation, promise or agreement, whether oral or written, is intended to
be or shall be included in or form part of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents or the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement unless it is contained
in a written amendment hereto or thereto and executed by the Parties hereto
or thereto after the date of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the
Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement. To the extent that there is any
conflict between the Ancillary Documents (other than the Amended and Restated
Omnibus Agreement) and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail.

10.12. Effect of Agreement. The Parties ratify and confirm that except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, in the event this Agreement conflicts in
any way with the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, the terms and
provisions of the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement shall control.

 

10.13. Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended only in a writing
signed by all parties hereto. Any waiver of rights hereunder must be set
forth in writing. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not in any way affect, limit or
waive any partys rights at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter
with every term or condition of this Agreement.

 



18 10.14. Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until 5:00
p.m., Dallas, Texas time on, on the anniversary of the Closing Date, except
