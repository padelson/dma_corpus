thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Umpqua. Umpqua (x)&nbsp;has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information
relating to Umpqua, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Umpqua, including Umpqua's principal executive and principal financial officers (or persons performing similar
functions),by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections&nbsp;302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y)&nbsp;has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Umpqua's outside auditors and the audit committee of Umpqua's Board of
Directors (i)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Umpqua's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Umpqua's internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Umpqua's
auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Sterling. To the knowledge of Umpqua, there is no reason to believe that Umpqua's outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. </FONT></P>
