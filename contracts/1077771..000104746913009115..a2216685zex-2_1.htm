 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Each Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Sterling Restricted Stock Unit under the applicable Sterling Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including as to vesting.

ARTICLE II 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

 2.1 _ Umpqua to Make Shares and Cash Available._ At or prior to the Effective Time, Umpqua shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Umpqua and reasonably acceptable to Sterling (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Umpqua\'s option, evidence of shares in book-entry form (collectively, referred to herein as "certificates"), representing the shares of Umpqua Common Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate stock portion of the Merger Consideration, and cash sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, including cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Umpqua Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.2(b), being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Sterling Common Stock. Umpqua shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time at or after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b). For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Fund shall not include any amounts to be paid to Dissenting Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Umpqua will enter into an exchange agent agreement on customary terms with the Exchange Agent, which terms shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Sterling. 

  

 2.2 _ Exchange of Shares._ 

  

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within ten (10) business days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of Sterling Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration that the shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed, duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Umpqua Common Stock to which such holder of Sterling Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Article II and any dividends or distributions that are then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash paid or payable in respect of the Merger Consideration. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, except as set forth in Section 1.6, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable under Section 2.2(b). For purposes of this Agreement, " _business day_ " means a day, other than Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York, New York are authorized or required by Law to close. 

   

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Umpqua Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall 

  

      

  

surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (i) any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, with a record date after the
Effective Time and previously paid or payable on the date of such
surrender with respect to the whole shares of Umpqua Common Stock which the
shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive (which amounts shall be paid at the time
the Merger Consideration is paid in respect of such Certificate) and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, any such dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time (but prior to such surrender date) which
thereafter become payable with respect to the whole shares of Umpqua Common
Stock which the shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

  

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of Umpqua Common Stock is to be issued in, or cash is to be paid to, a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Umpqua Common Stock and/or the payment of cash in respect of the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares) in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Sterling of the shares of Sterling Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than to settle transfers of such Sterling Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing shares of Sterling Common Stock are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Umpqua Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Umpqua Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Umpqua. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Umpqua shall pay to each former shareholder of Sterling who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Umpqua Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Sterling Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Umpqua Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Sterling for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation and any former shareholders of Sterling who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Umpqua Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Sterling Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Umpqua, Sterling, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Sterling Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (g) Umpqua shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Sterling Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Umpqua or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Sterling Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Umpqua or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Umpqua, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Umpqua or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 

    
ARTICLE III 

  

  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF STERLING 

  

 Except (i) as Previously Disclosed by Sterling or (ii) as disclosed in any Sterling Reports publicly filed under Sections 13(a), 14(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act by Sterling with the SEC since December 31, 2012, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Sterling hereby represents and warrants to Umpqua as follows: 

  

 3.1 _ Corporate Organization._ 

  

  

 (a) Sterling is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Washington, and is a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). Sterling has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Sterling is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Sterling or Umpqua, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed not to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in Laws of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war, hostilities, or acts of terrorism or natural disasters) or in economic or market conditions (including changes in prevailing interest rates, credit availability and liquidity, currency exchange rates, and price levels or trading volumes in the United States or foreign securities markets) affecting the financial services industry generally, (D) changes after the date hereof in the banking industry, credit markets, any downgrades in the 

  

      

  

credit markets, or adverse credit events resulting in deterioration in the
credit markets generally and including changes to any previously correctly
applied asset marks resulting therefrom, (E) public disclosure of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (F) actions or omissions expressly required
by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the
other party or (G) a decline in the trading price of a party\'s common stock
or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections, but not, in
either case, including the underlying causes thereof; except, with respect to
clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change
are materially disproportionately adverse to the business,
properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition
of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate)
or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ ,"
when used with respect to any person, means any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, bank or other entity or organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which stock or other equity interests
having ordinary voting power to elect more than 50% of the board of directors
or other governing body are owned, directly or indirectly, by such person.
True and complete copies of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of
Sterling, as amended through the date hereof (the " _Sterling Articles_ ")
and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Sterling, as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Sterling to Umpqua.

No trust funding any Sterling Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. 

  

 (e) Except as would not reasonably be likely to result in material liability to Sterling or its Subsidiaries, each Sterling Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 (g) Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any material obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code. 

  

 (h) All material contributions required to be made to any Sterling Benefit Plan under applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Sterling Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of Sterling.

 (j) None of Sterling and its Subsidiaries has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries or any person that Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify in respect thereof to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF UMPQUA 

  

 Except (i) as Previously Disclosed by Umpqua or (ii) as disclosed in any Umpqua Reports publicly filed under Sections 13(a), 14(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act by Umpqua with the SEC since December 31, 2012, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Umpqua hereby represents and warrants to Sterling as follows: 

  

 4.1 _ Corporate Organization._ 

  

  

 (a) Umpqua is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Oregon and is a bank holding company and financial holding company duly registered under the BHC Act. Umpqua has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Umpqua is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Umpqua. True and complete copies of the Umpqua Articles and Bylaws of Umpqua, in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Umpqua to Sterling. 

  

 (b) Each Subsidiary of Umpqua (a " _Umpqua Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable Law, in good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable) in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Umpqua and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Umpqua to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Umpqua that is an insured depository institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of Umpqua, threatened.

No Umpqua Subsidiary owns any capital stock of Umpqua other than any Third Party Shares.

Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of

 4.5 _ Reports._ Umpqua and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 2011 with any Regulatory Agencies, including, without limitation, any report, registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the Laws of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Umpqua. Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of the business of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Umpqua, investigation into the business or operations of Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2011, except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Umpqua.

 4.6 _ Financial Statements._ 

  

  

 (a) The financial statements of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Umpqua Reports filed by Umpqua with the SEC since January 1, 2012 (including the related notes, where applicable) (i) in all material respects have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders\' equity and consolidated financial position of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods 

  

      

  

or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of
unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount), (iii) complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing
with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
and (iv) in all material respects have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records
of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and in all material respects reflect only actual
transactions. Moss Adams LLP has not resigned (or informed Umpqua that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Umpqua as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Umpqua on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  

 (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Umpqua, neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for (i) liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013 (including any notes thereto), (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2013 or (iii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. None of Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any material "off-balance sheet arrangements" as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

  

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Umpqua or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Umpqua. Umpqua (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Umpqua, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Umpqua, including Umpqua\'s principal executive and principal financial officers (or persons performing similar functions),by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Umpqua\'s outside auditors and the audit committee of Umpqua\'s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Umpqua\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Umpqua\'s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Umpqua\'s auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Sterling. To the knowledge of Umpqua, there is no reason to believe that Umpqua\'s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 

  

      

  

 (d) Since January 1, 2011, (i) neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Umpqua, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of it or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Umpqua or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Umpqua or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Umpqua.

 (c) Since June 30, 2013 and prior to the date hereof, neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries has made, declared or paid any dividend or other distribution on, or directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired, any shares of its capital stock, trust preferred securities or any other securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock other than dividends by wholly-owned Subsidiaries.

 4.10 _ Taxes and Tax Returns._ Each of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time within 

        

which to file any material Tax Return (other than extensions to file Tax
Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material Taxes of Umpqua and its
Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been
fully and timely paid. Each of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries has withheld and
paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent
contractor or other third party. Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries
has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to
any Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of Umpqua and
its Subsidiaries for all years to and including 2008 have been examined by the
IRS or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for
assessment under applicable Law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers,
has expired. Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
written notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any
material amount of Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or pending
disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Tax with respect to Umpqua and its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Umpqua and its Subsidiaries. Umpqua has made available to Sterling true and
complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or
gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the
last six years. Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among Umpqua and its Subsidiaries or that has a principal purpose other
than Tax matters). Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax
Return (other than a group the common parent of which was Umpqua) or (B) has
any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Umpqua or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries has been,
within the past three years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of
related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of
which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries has
participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five years has
Umpqua been a United States real property holding corporation within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

No trust funding any Umpqua Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. 

  

 (e) Except as would not reasonably be likely to result in material liability to Umpqua or its Subsidiaries, each Umpqua Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (f) None of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Umpqua ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, maintained, sponsored, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any plan that is (i) a Title IV Plan, (ii) a Multiemployer Plan or (iii) a Multiple Employer Plan, and none of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Umpqua ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material liability to a Title IV Plan or a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan. 

  

 (g) Neither Umpqua nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any material obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 (i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Umpqua, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Umpqua, threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or 

  

      

  

arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to Umpqua\'s
knowledge, no such claim or lawsuit is threatened, against the Umpqua Benefit
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Umpqua
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Umpqua
Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of
Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the Department of

ARTICLE VI 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

  

 6.1 _ Regulatory Matters_. 

  

  

 (a) Umpqua and Sterling shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and Umpqua shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Umpqua and Sterling shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Umpqua and Sterling shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders. Umpqua shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Sterling shall furnish all information concerning Sterling and the holders of Sterling Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file and cause their Subsidiaries to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as 

  

      

  

practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties or Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereto agree to use reasonable best efforts to prepare
and file and cause their Subsidiaries to prepare and file all
necessary documentation, and to file all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, in connection with obtaining all Requisite Regulatory Approvals no
later than forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement. Umpqua and
Sterling shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all information
relating to Sterling or Umpqua, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries (excluding any confidential financial information
relating to individuals or to Warburg Pincus Private Equity X, L.P., Warburg
Pincus X Partners, L.P., Thomas H. Lee Equity Fund VI, L.P., Thomas H. Lee
Parallel Fund VI, L.P. or Thomas H. Lee Parallel (DT) Fund VI, L.P. or any of
their respective affiliates (excluding Sterling and its Subsidiaries)), which
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein, including by delivery of a copy of any
applications, notices, petitions or filings made by a party to the other
party, subject to the limitations set forth above. Wherever practicable under
the circumstances, each party shall consult with the other in advance of any
meeting or conference with any Governmental scheduled in advance for the
express purpose of discussing applications for approval of the transactions
contemplated herein and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
give the other party and its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require either party
to, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of Governmental Entities or third parties, take any
action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction
that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Surviving Corporation (assuming for this purpose that the Surviving
Corporation consists of Umpqua and Sterling and their respective Subsidiaries
taken as a whole) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "),
_provided_ that the sale of one or more branches of Sterling or Umpqua in a
geographic banking market shall not constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there would be, a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition.

  

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Umpqua and Sterling shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Umpqua or Sterling to take any actions specified in this Section 6.1(c) that would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition. 

  

 (d) Umpqua and Sterling shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders ( _provided_ that, with respect to information concerning Warburg Pincus Private Equity X, L.P., Warburg Pincus X 

  

      

  

Partners, L.P., Thomas H. Lee Equity Fund VI, L.P., Thomas H. Lee Parallel
Fund VI, L.P. or Thomas H. Lee (DT) Fund VI, L.P. or any of their respective
affiliates (excluding Sterling and its Subsidiaries), this Section 6.1(d)
shall apply if, and only to the extent, Sterling is in possession of such
information and is permitted to furnish such information to Umpqua) and such
other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Umpqua, Sterling or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Umpqua and Sterling agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the date of mailing to the shareholders of Umpqua
and Sterling and at the time of the Sterling Meeting and Umpqua Meeting, as
the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading. Each of Umpqua and Sterling
further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it
would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to
be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate
steps to correct the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

  

 (e) Umpqua and Sterling shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. 

  

  

 6.2 _ Access to Information_. 

  

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, each of Umpqua and Sterling, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and the compliance of the other with its covenants and of preparing for the Merger and the Bank Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, each of Umpqua and Sterling shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available (it being understood that documents available via the SEC\'s EDGAR system shall be deemed to have been made available for purposes of this covenant) to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it or any of its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities Laws or federal or state banking Laws (other than reports or documents which Umpqua or Sterling, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request (it being understood that the provision of any information or documents regarding auditor work papers shall be subject to the customary and reasonable requirements of such auditors). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Umpqua nor Sterling nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose (x) information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in 

  

      

  

possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or (y) personnel
records that, in its good faith opinion, could subject it to risk of
liability. The parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of business of the other party or any
of its Subsidiaries.

  

 (b) Each of Umpqua and Sterling shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party\'s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated February 24, 2013, between Umpqua and Sterling (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

  

 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. 

  

  

 6.3 _ Shareholders\' Approvals_. 

  

  

 (a) Each of Umpqua and Sterling shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and their respective articles of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents to duly call, give notice of, convene and, as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, hold a meeting of its shareholders or, except as otherwise provided herein, use its reasonable best efforts to take such other actions necessary to obtain the relevant shareholder approvals, in each case as promptly as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Umpqua Vote, in the case of Umpqua, and the Requisite Sterling Vote, in the case of Sterling (each such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Umpqua Meeting_ " and the " _Sterling Meeting_ ", respectively) but subject to Section 6.3(d). Except in the case of a Change in Board Recommendation by such party expressly permitted by this Section 6.3(a), Umpqua shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Requisite Umpqua Vote at the Umpqua Meeting and Sterling shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Requisite Sterling Vote at the Sterling Meeting. Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.3(a), the Board of Directors of Umpqua and Sterling shall (i) recommend to its respective shareholders the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein (including, in the case of Umpqua, the Articles Amendment) (the " _Board Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and (iii) not approve, agree to or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of each of Umpqua and Sterling shall be permitted (x) not to recommend to their respective shareholders that they give the Requisite Umpqua Vote or the Requisite Sterling Vote, as the case may be, (y) not to include the Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and/or (z) to otherwise withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the Board Recommendation (the actions described in clauses (x), (y) and (z), each a " _Change in Board Recommendation_ "), in each case in response to (1) a material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence which is unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to or by the Board of Directors of such party as of the date hereof (and does not relate to a Superior Proposal, which is addressed in the following clause (2)), but becomes known to or by the Board of Directors of such party prior to obtaining the Requisite Sterling Vote or Requisite Umpqua Vote, as applicable (an " _Intervening Business Event"_ ) or (2) the receipt of an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of such party determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, is a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Event_ "), in each case, if and only if, the Board of Directors of such party determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would 

  

      

  

be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Prior to
Umpqua or Sterling, as the case may be, making a Change in Board
Recommendation, (i) in the case of a Change in Board Recommendation in
connection with an Intervening Business Event, (A) three business days shall
have elapsed following delivery by such party to the other party of written
notice advising the other party that such party\'s Board of Directors intends
to resolve to effect a Change in Board Recommendation and (B) the other party
shall not have proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions hereof during
such three (3) business day period (during which period the party delivering
notice of its intention to effect a Change in Board Recommendation shall have
negotiated with the other party to this Agreement in good faith (to the
extent such other party to this Agreement desires to negotiate) with respect
to such adjustments) that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the
party proposing to effect a Change in Board Recommendation, obviate the need
for such Change in Board Recommendation, and (ii) in the case of a Change in
Board Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal Event, (A) three
(3) business days (subject to extension as set forth below in this sentence)
shall have elapsed following delivery by such party to the other party of
written notice advising the other party that such party\'s Board of Directors
intends to resolve to effect a Change in Board Recommendation absent
modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice
shall specify the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal and the
material terms and conditions thereof and include a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements with the person making such Superior
Proposal and all other material documents provided by such person relating
thereto, (B) assuming this Agreement was amended to reflect all adjustments
to the terms and conditions hereof proposed by the other party to this
Agreement during such three (3) business day period (during which period the
party delivering the notice of its intention to effect a Change in Board
Recommendation shall have negotiated with the other party to this Agreement in
good faith (to the extent such other party to this Agreement desires to
negotiate) with respect to such adjustments), such Acquisition Proposal
nonetheless continues, in the good faith judgment, after receiving the advice
of outside legal counsel, of the Board of Directors of the party proposing to
make a Change in Board Recommendation, to constitute a Superior Proposal and
(C) the party delivering the notice of its intention to effect a Change in
Board Recommendation shall have complied to date with its obligations set
forth in this Section 6.3(a) and Section 6.11; _provided_ , _however_ , that
following any material revision to such Superior Proposal, such party shall
be required to deliver a new written notice to the other party in accordance
with this sentence and to again comply with the requirements of this sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (1) nothing in
this Agreement shall be interpreted to excuse either party and its Board of
Directors from complying with its obligation to submit this Agreement to
its shareholders at the Umpqua Meeting or Sterling Meeting, as the case may
be, or from complying with the obligations set forth in Section 6.3(d), and
(2) neither party shall submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction other than the Merger. Without
limiting the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of Umpqua or Sterling has
effected a Change in Board Recommendation as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.3(a), then the Board of Directors of such party may submit this
Agreement to its shareholders without the Board Recommendation (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of such party may
communicate the basis for its Change in Recommendation to its shareholders in
the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

  

      

                                    

  

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means, with respect to either Sterling or Umpqua, a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that is (x) for 100% of the outstanding shares of such party\'s capital stock, on terms that the Board of Directors of such party determines in its good faith judgment (after taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by the other party to this Agreement to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement), including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation, the form of consideration offered and the ability of the person making such proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition Proposal, and after taking into account all other legal, financial, strategic, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including the identity of the person making such proposal, and this Agreement) are more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders, than the Merger and (y) reasonably likely, as determined by the Board of Directors of such party in its good faith judgment, to receive all necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis. 

  

 (c) Sterling and Umpqua shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Sterling Meeting and the Umpqua Meeting on the same date. 

   

 (d) Each party shall cooperate and keep the other party informed on a current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the shareholders of each party. If at any time following the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement (i) Sterling reasonably determines in good faith that the Requisite Umpqua Vote is unlikely to be obtained at the Umpqua Meeting, or (ii) Umpqua reasonably determines in good faith that the Requisite Sterling Vote is unlikely to be obtained at the Sterling Meeting, then prior to the vote contemplated having been taken such party may request that the other party adjourn or postpone its meeting for up to 45 days from the then-scheduled date and the other party shall comply with such request; _provided_ that a party shall be required to adjourn or postpone its meeting on only one occasion. During such period of adjournment or postponement, the parties shall continue in all respects to comply with their obligations under this Section 6.3 and shall in good faith use reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders) and, subject to this Section 6.3, seek to obtain the Requisite Umpqua Vote and/or the Requisite Sterling Vote, as the case may be. Except as set forth in this Section 6.3(d), no party shall have the obligation to postpone or adjourn its shareholder meeting. 

  

  

 6.4 _ Legal Conditions to Merger._ Subject in all respects to Sections 6.1, 6.3 and 6.11, each of Umpqua and Sterling shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Sterling or Umpqua or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.5 _ Stock Exchange Listing._ Umpqua shall cause the shares of Umpqua Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

        

 6.6 _ Employee Benefit Plans._ 

  

  

 (a) Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Umpqua and Sterling, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided each individual who is an employee of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), while such individual is employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, with compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate (excluding any benefits accelerated or payable as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Umpqua and its Subsidiaries. Any Continuing Employee who is not otherwise eligible for severance compensation or benefits under an employment agreement or other agreement (including a participation agreement under the Sterling Change in Control Severance Plan) and whose employment is terminated without cause following the Effective Time shall be eligible for severance benefits under the Umpqua Severance Policy. Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 shall be deemed to grant any Continuing Employee any right to continued employment after the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Umpqua or any of its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (a " _New Benefit Plan_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Benefit Plans in which such employees first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Sterling Benefit Plan; (ii) provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Sterling Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Sterling Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Benefit Plans in which such employees first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (iii) recognize all service of such Continuing Employees with Sterling and its Subsidiaries since their date of hire with Sterling or its Subsidiaries, for all purposes in any New Benefit Plan in which such employees first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the same extent that such service was taken into account under one or more of the comparable Sterling Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that, as of the Effective Time, is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits. 

   

 (c) Subject to Section 6.6(h), following the Effective Time, Umpqua will or, as applicable, will cause its Subsidiaries to, honor all contractual obligations under all Sterling Benefit Plans that exist on the date of this Agreement (or as established or amended in accordance with or permitted by this Agreement or the terms of the applicable Sterling Benefit Plan) that apply to any current or former employee, officer or director of Sterling or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Sterling and each of its Subsidiaries shall take all actions reasonably requested by Umpqua that may be necessary or appropriate to (i) cause the Sterling Benefit Plans set forth in Section 6.6(d)(i) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule to terminate as of the Closing Date, or as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under the Sterling Benefit Plans set forth in Section 6.6(d)(ii) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule to cease as of the Closing Date, or as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date or (iii) facilitate the merger as of or following the Closing Date of the Sterling Benefit Plans set forth in Section 6.6(d)(iii) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule into an 

  

      

  

analogous Umpqua Benefit Plan; _provided_ that no action to be taken pursuant
to this Section 6.6(d) shall result in any gap in coverage under,
or participation in, any benefit plan or program of the type that Umpqua
requests Sterling to terminate or suspend pursuant to this Section 6.6(d). All
resolutions, notices, or other documents issued, adopted or executed in
connection with the implementation of this Section 6.6(d) shall be subject to
Umpqua\'s prior review and approval.

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, Sterling and each of its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Umpqua to allow Umpqua, in its reasonable discretion, to (i) arrange and conduct for Continuing Employees an open enrollment period for the New Benefit Plans (to the extent any such plans will be made available to the applicable Continuing Employee) and employee orientation sessions (with such sessions to be held at times reasonably agreed to by Umpqua and Sterling), and (ii) meet with employees of Sterling and its Subsidiaries at reasonable times as mutually agreed to by Umpqua and Sterling. 

  

 (f) With respect to any bonus or commission for which any employee of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes eligible under any of the Sterling Benefit Plans that are bonus plans or commission plans with respect to the year in which the Effective Time occurs, Umpqua shall administer each such plan in good faith and pursuant to its terms and make payment of all amounts owed pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan at the ordinary time bonuses or commissions would otherwise be paid under such plans in accordance with the terms of such plans; _provided_ that to the extent the amount payable to employees under such plans is determined by reference to Sterling performance metrics that are no longer applicable following the Effective Time, the applicable performance metrics for the period following the Effective Time shall be appropriately adjusted as mutually agreed in good faith between Sterling and Umpqua prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (g) Sterling and Umpqua acknowledge and agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change of control" under the Sterling Benefit Plans set forth in Section 6.6(g) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of Umpqua or Sterling or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, Sterling, Umpqua or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Sterling, Umpqua or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Umpqua or Sterling or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Sterling Benefit Plan, Umpqua Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Umpqua, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Sterling Benefit Plan, Umpqua Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including without limitation any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Umpqua or Sterling or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.6. 

  

  

 6.7 _ Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries and any person who is or was serving at or prior to the Effective Time as a director or officer (or in a like 

  

      

  

capacity) of another person at the request of Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Sterling Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether arising
before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries or
serving as a director or officer (or in a like capacity) of another person at
the request of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries and in respect of any acts
or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) of or by any such Sterling
Indemnified Party occurring (or alleged to have occurred) at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Sterling Indemnified Party
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such Sterling Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification.

  

 (b) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Sterling Indemnified Party as provided in the Sterling Articles, Sterling\'s Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents of Sterling\'s Subsidiaries) and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on Section 6.7(b) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Parties, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation so long as the Surviving Corporation otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder. 

  

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by Sterling ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed the amount set forth on Section 6.7(c)(i) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation\'s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Umpqua, or Sterling upon the consent of Umpqua, may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail" policy under Sterling\'s existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence for an aggregate price of no more than the amount set forth on Section 6.7(c)(ii) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule. Sterling and Umpqua agree to cooperate in good faith in connection with obtaining such "tail" policy, including with respect to determining terms and pricing. 

  

 (d) If the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall also assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. The rights of each Sterling Indemnified Party under this Section 6.7 shall 

  

      

  

be in addition to any rights such person may have under the Sterling Articles
and Sterling Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents of Sterling\'s
Subsidiaries), or under applicable Law or any agreement of any Sterling
Indemnified Party with Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on
Section 6.7(d) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule) which shall survive the
Merger and shall continue to be in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified. The
provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Sterling
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

  

  

 6.8 _ Additional Agreements._ In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of Umpqua, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Sterling, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to, in the name and on behalf of Sterling and Umpqua, execute and deliver such deeds, bills of sale, assignment or assurances and take all such other action as may be necessary in connection therewith. 

  

 6.9 _ Advice of Changes._ Umpqua and Sterling shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying change or event would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied. 

  

 6.10 _ Dividends._ After the date of this Agreement, each of Umpqua and Sterling shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of Umpqua Common Stock and Sterling Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the agreement of the parties hereto that holders of Sterling Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Sterling Common Stock and any shares of Umpqua Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

  

 6.11 _ Acquisition Proposals._ 

  

  

 (a) Neither Sterling nor Umpqua shall, and each of Sterling and Umpqua shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and controlled affiliates and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other retained representatives or agents (each, a " _Representative_ ") not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock or equity interests (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving such party or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction or Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to receipt of the Requisite Sterling Vote, in the case of Sterling, or the Requisite Umpqua Vote, in the case of Umpqua, in the event that either Sterling or Umpqua shall receive an Acquisition Proposal that 

  

      

  

was not solicited by it and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.11 and which the Board of Directors of the applicable party
determines, in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside
counsel, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal, if and only if, the Board of Directors of such party determines in
its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, such party and its Representatives, as applicable, may
(A) furnish information with respect to it and its Subsidiaries to the party
making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives and financing
sources pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms no
less restrictive to the party making the Acquisition Proposal than the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_  that a copy of all
such written information is substantially simultaneously provided to the other
party to this Agreement (if not previously provided), and (B) participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

   

 (b) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " shall mean, with respect to each of Umpqua and Sterling, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (A) the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by (x) any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y) such party or any of its Subsidiaries of assets (whether through a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or other transaction) that would constitute more than fifteen percent (15%) of the consolidated assets of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such party; (C) the issuance of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the current number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such party other than in a bona fide capital raising transaction; or (D) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the shareholders of any person) first becoming the beneficial owner of fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of such party or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

   

 (c) Each of Sterling and Umpqua shall notify the other party to this Agreement promptly (but in no event later than one business day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of such party or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that has made, or to such party\'s knowledge is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the other party to this Agreement shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. Sterling and Umpqua shall keep the other party to this Agreement fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. 

  

 (d) Each of Sterling and Umpqua and their respective Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than the other party to this Agreement) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. Each of Sterling and Umpqua has not and agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from, and also agrees to enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which it or its Subsidiaries is a party that remains in effect as of the date 

  

      

  

hereof. As of the date hereof, the parties agree that Section 8 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no further force or effect.

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors of either Sterling or Umpqua from disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a modification of the Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the other party to this Agreement unless the Board of Directors of the party making the disclosure or communication expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Board Recommendation. 

  

  

 6.12 _ Public Announcements._ Sterling and Umpqua shall consult with and provide each other with the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation, except if such issuance, statement or comment is required by applicable Law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange and compliance with this Section 6.12 is not practicable. 

  

 6.13 _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, each of Sterling and Umpqua shall take all steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Sterling Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Sterling Common Stock) or acquisitions of Umpqua Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Umpqua Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Sterling or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Umpqua to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 6.14 _ Trust Preferred Securities._ Upon the Effective Time, Umpqua shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by Sterling under the Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2006, between Sterling and Wilmington Trust Company relating to floating rate trust preferred securities issued by Sterling Capital Statutory Trust VII (the " _VII Trust Preferred Securities_ ") and the Indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006, between Sterling and Wilmington Trust Company relating to floating rate trust preferred securities issued by Sterling Capital Statutory Trust VIII (the " _VIII Trust Preferred Securities_ " and, together with the VII Trust Preferred Securities, the " _Trust Preferred Securities_ "), and the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Trust Preferred Securities. In connection therewith, Umpqua and Sterling shall execute and deliver any supplemental indentures or other documents, and the parties hereto shall provide any opinion of counsel, in each case reasonably requested by the trustee thereof, to the trustee thereof, required to make such assumptions effective. 

  

 6.15 _ Employment Agreements._ Simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, Umpqua shall enter into employment agreements or agreements for services with each of the individuals listed in Section 6.15 of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, to be effective as of and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, which agreements shall following the Effective Time set forth the terms and conditions of each such individual\'s employment or other relationship with the Surviving Corporation and shall supersede and replace any prior employment, retention, change of control or other similar agreements between each such individual and Sterling.

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT 

  

 8.1 _ Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time and, except as specified below, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of Umpqua or Sterling: 

  

  

 (a) by mutual consent of Umpqua and Sterling in a written instrument authorized by the Board of Directors of each; 

  

 (b) by either Umpqua or Sterling if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has (i) denied approval of the consummation of any of the material transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger or Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of any of the material transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger or Bank Merger or (ii) granted the Requisite Regulatory Approval but such Requisite Regulatory Approval contains or results in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition and there is no meaningful possibility that such Requisite Regulatory Approval could be revised prior to the Termination Date so as not to contain or result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition, unless, in either case, the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval or to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval without it containing or resulting in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

  

 (c) by either Umpqua or Sterling if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

  

 (d) by either Umpqua or Sterling if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other party, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party, such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 (in the case of a termination by Umpqua) or Section 7.3 (in the case of a termination by Sterling) would not be satisfied, and (i) such breach is not reasonably 

  

      

  

capable of being cured or (ii) if such breach is reasonably capable of being
cured, is not cured within the earlier of (A) the Termination Date or (B) the
date that is 30 days following written notice thereof to the party committing
such breach; _provided_ in each case that the terminating party is not then
in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of
such party contained herein such that any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 (in the case of a termination by Sterling) or Section 7.3 (in the
case of a termination by Umpqua) would not be satisfied;

  

 (e) by either Umpqua or Sterling if (i) the Umpqua Meeting (including any postponements or adjournments thereof) shall have concluded with the vote contemplated by Section 4.3(a) having been taken and the Requisite Umpqua Vote shall not have been obtained or (ii) the Sterling Meeting (including any postponements or adjournments thereof) shall have concluded with the vote contemplated by Section 3.3(a) having been taken and the Requisite Sterling Vote shall have not been obtained; _provided_  that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 6.3 (including by complying with an adjournment or postponement request under Section 6.3(d)); 

  

 (f) by Sterling, prior to obtaining the Requisite Umpqua Vote, if the Board of Directors of Umpqua shall have (i) effected a Change in Board Recommendation (or in the case of a tender or exchange offer, failed to recommend rejection of such offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act) or (ii) failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations under Section 6.1(a), 6.3 or 6.11; or 

  

 (g) by Umpqua, prior to obtaining the Requisite Sterling Vote, if the Board of Directors of Sterling shall have (i) effected a Change in Board Recommendation (or in the case of a tender or exchange offer, failed to recommend rejection of such offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act) or (ii) failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations under Section 6.1(a), 6.3 or 6.11. 

  

  

 The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.4, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected and confirm that the Board of Directors of such terminating party has authorized such termination. 

  

 8.2 _ Effect of Termination_ 

  

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Umpqua or Sterling as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Umpqua, Sterling, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b) and 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.1 and, except as it relates to surviving provisions, Section 9.12) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, except Section 8.2(e), neither Umpqua nor Sterling shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful, knowing and material breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to termination (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses and out-of-pocket costs, and may include, to the extent proven, the benefit of the bargain lost by Sterling\'s or Umpqua\'s (as applicable) stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party). 

  

 (b) In the event that (x) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred after the date of this Agreement with respect to Sterling and thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Umpqua or Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii), (B) by 

  

      

  

Umpqua pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (as a result of a willful and knowing
breach of this Agreement), (C) by Sterling or Umpqua pursuant to Section
8.1(c) (if the Requisite Sterling Vote had not been obtained prior to
termination and all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 had
been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination)
or (D) by Umpqua pursuant to Section 8.1(g) and (y) prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination Sterling enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Alternative
Transaction (whether or not involving the same Acquisition Proposal as that
which was the subject of the Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event),
then Sterling shall, on the date of entry into such agreement, or on the date
of consummation if the Alternative Transaction is consummated without entry
into a definitive agreement, pay Umpqua a fee equal to $75 million by wire
transfer of same day funds (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that for
the purposes of clause (y) only, (1) all references in the definition of
Alternative Transaction to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall instead be references
to "fifty percent (50%)" and (2) clause (A)(y) of the definition of
Alternative Transaction shall not be given any force or effect.

  

 (c) In the event that (x) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event shall have occurred after the date of this Agreement with respect to Umpqua and thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Umpqua or Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i), (B) by Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (as a result of a willful and knowing breach of this Agreement), (C) by Sterling or Umpqua pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (if the Requisite Umpqua Vote had not been obtained prior to termination and all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 had been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (D) by Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and (y) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination Umpqua enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Alternative Transaction (whether or not involving the same Acquisition Proposal as that which was the subject of the Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event), then Umpqua shall, on the date of entry into such agreement, or on the date of consummation if the Alternative Transaction is consummated without entry into a definitive agreement, pay Sterling the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds; _provided_ that for the purposes of clause (y) only, (1) all references in the definition of Alternative Transaction to "fifteen percent (15%)" shall instead be references to "fifty percent (50%)" and (2) clause (A)(y) of the definition of Alternative Transaction shall not be given any force or effect. 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Section 8.2, a " _Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event_ " shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the right to terminate this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to Sterling\'s Board of Directors or senior management (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal relating to Sterling for purposes of Section 8.2(b)) or shall have been made known to Umpqua\'s Board of Directors or senior management (in the case of any Acquisition Proposal relating to Umpqua for purposes of Section 8.2(c) or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to Sterling or Umpqua, as applicable, and in any such case such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the event giving rise to such termination. 

  

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, neither Umpqua nor Sterling shall be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each of Umpqua and Sterling agrees that, upon termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable to it and such Termination Fee is paid in full, it shall be precluded from any other remedy against the other party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, at law or in equity or otherwise, and it shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the other party or any of the other party\'s Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, 

  

       

  

managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective
representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

 (f) Each of Umpqua and Sterling acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Umpqua or Sterling, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Umpqua or Sterling, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. 

  

  

 8.3 _ Amendment._ Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of Umpqua and Sterling; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the respective shareholders of Umpqua or Sterling, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered hereunder to the holders of Sterling Common Stock or that otherwise requires the approval of such shareholders under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

   

 8.4 _ Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the respective shareholders of Umpqua or Sterling, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Sterling Common Stock hereunder or that otherwise requires the approval of such shareholders under applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 9.5 _ Interpretation._ The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." References to "the date hereof" shall mean the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the " _knowledge_ " of Sterling means the actual knowledge of any of the officers of Sterling listed on Section 9.5 of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, and the " _knowledge_ " of Umpqua means the actual knowledge of any of the officers of Umpqua listed on Section 9.5 of the Umpqua Disclosure Schedule.

The Sterling Disclosure Schedule and the Umpqua Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall require any party or person to take any action in violation of applicable Law. 

  

 9.6 _ Disclosure Schedule._ 

  

  

 (a) Before entry into this Agreement, Sterling delivered to Umpqua a schedule (a " _Sterling Disclosure Schedule_ ") and Umpqua delivered to Sterling a schedule a (" _Umpqua Disclosure Schedule_ " and, together with the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ "), each of which sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article III or Article IV, respectively, or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty or covenant if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect or the related covenant being breached, (ii) the Disclosure Schedules may include certain items and information solely for informational purposes and (iii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means information set forth by Sterling or Umpqua in the Sterling Disclosure Schedule or Umpqua Disclosure Schedule, as applicable; _provided_ that disclosure in any section of such schedule shall apply only to the corresponding Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to one or more other Sections of this Agreement (in which case it will be deemed to have also been disclosed for purposes of such other Section or Sections). 

  

  

 9.7 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

        

 9.8 _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) together with the Investor Letter Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 9.9 _ Governing Law; Jurisdiction._ 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law, except that (i) the Merger and the Bank Merger shall be governed by the laws of the States of Oregon and Washington and (ii) matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Sterling and the Board of Directors of Umpqua and similar or related internal affairs matters shall be subject to the laws of the State of Washington or the State of Oregon, as applicable. 

  

 (b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any other Delaware State court (such courts, the " _Delaware Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom), (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Delaware Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 9.4. 

  

  

 9.10 _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the extent permitted by Law at the time of institution of the applicable litigation, any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that: (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver; (ii) each party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver; (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily; and (iv) each party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.10. 

  

 9.11 _ Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in 

        

this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of
the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  

 9.12 _ Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties\' obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. 

  

 9.13 _ Severability._ Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

 9.14 _ Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission._ This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
