A. _The Proposed Transactions_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, the parties intend to effect a strategic business
combination pursuant to which Merger Sub, a newly formed, wholly owned
Subsidiary of Acquirer, will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"). The Company will be the surviving company in the Merger and shall
continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware immediately
thereafter. Following the Merger, at the option of Acquirer, the Company will
merge with and into Acquirer with Acquirer being the surviving corporation
(the " _Acquirer Merger_ "). The Acquirer Merger sometimes is referred to
herein as the " _Subsequent Merger_ " _._ Immediately prior to the Merger,
Radius Bank (" _Company Bank_ ") will terminate its election as a
"covered savings association" pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 101, move its home
office to Utah and reclassify its former home office as a branch (the "

will convert from a federal savings bank to a national bank (the "
_Conversion_ "). Immediately following the Conversion, Acquirer will
contribute certain assets and certain operations to the Company Bank and the
Company Bank will execute its proposed business plan (the " _Contribution and
Business Plan Execution_ "). The Acquirer Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the
Termination and Relocation, the Conversion, and the Contribution and Business
Plan Execution, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Core
Transactions_ " and are also included within the scope of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

B. _Board Determinations_. The respective boards of directors of the Company
and Acquirer have each determined that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are consistent with, and will further, their respective
business strategies and goals and are in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, and, therefore, have unanimously approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
declared their advisability, and in the case of the board of directors of the
Company, have recommended the foregoing to the stockholders of the Company
entitled to vote thereon.

 

C. _Support Agreements_. As an inducement to and condition of Acquirers
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain directors, officers and
stockholders of the Company (such stockholders representing more than ninety
percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Class A Voting
Common Stock and one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Class B Non-Voting Common Stock) are concurrently entering
into support agreements (" _Support Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, among
other things, such persons agree to vote all of their shares of Company
Common Stock in favor of approval of this Agreement, the Merger and any other
matters required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. A form of Support Agreement is

Balance Sheet confirming the correct Closing Tangible Book Value (as

Date, within ten (10) days following such engagement. The parties will
cooperate fully with, and furnish such information as may be requested to, the
Independent Accountants. The Final Closing Balance Sheet issued by the
Independent Accountants, as well as the amount of Closing Tangible Book Value

bear all costs and fees incurred by it in connection with the foregoing
arbitration; _provided_ that (i) the fees and expenses of the Independent

after-tax costs, fees and expenses to be borne by the Company shall be
deducted from any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(4) of this
Agreement.

Sheet and Closing Tangible Book Value by the Independent Accountants, the Per
Share Consideration shall be recalculated and the Acquirer shall pay as
provided for herein the amount by which the recalculated Per Share
Consideration exceeds the Per Share Consideration used in connection with the

(5) To facilitate reaching an agreed Final Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Tangible Book Value without the need for an arbitration, commencing
with the eighth (8th) month end after the Execution Date, at least ten (10)
days prior to the end of each month, the parties shall work in good faith to
understand and agree on what the foregoing would be at the end of each such

Portfolio_ ") for purposes of determining, as of the most recent month end
prior to the Closing Date, an appropriate reserve for the SBA Portfolio under
GAAP ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments  Credit Losses (Topic 326) commonly
referred to as Current Expected Credit Losses (" _CECL_ ") expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount of the SBA Portfolio (the " _Reserve
Percentage_ "). Such evaluation need not be based on the Companys accounting
policies and practices and may be a  _de novo_ review based on the Evaluation
Firms professional judgment and discretion. The Company may not use its
existing independent accounting firm as its Evaluation Firm.

 

(2) Not later than 13 days before the Anticipated Closing Date, Acquirer shall
deliver to the Company the report of its Evaluation Firm that states its
conclusions and the basis therefor and its determination of the appropriate
Reserve Percentage (the " _Acquirer Reserve Percentage_ ") and the Company
shall deliver to Acquirer the report of its Evaluation Firm that states its

Reserve Percentage (the " _Company Reserve Percentage_ ").

 

(3) If either the Acquirer Reserve Percentage or the Company Reserve
Percentage exceeds 5.9%, there shall be a " _SBA Reduction Amount_ "
(otherwise the SBA Reduction Amount shall be zero) and the SBA Reduction
Amount shall be the product of (i) 0.7115 and (ii) (A) the principal amount of
the SBA Portfolio as set forth in the Final Closing Balance Sheet or if there
shall be no Final Closing Balance Sheet as otherwise agreed in writing by the
parties in good faith and (B) the average of the Acquirer Reserve Percentage
and the Company Reserve Percentage (such percentage, the " _Final Reserve
Factor_ ") _minus_ 5.9%.

(4) The parties shall complete the process set forth in this Section 3.1(d)
prior to the Anticipated Closing Date. The Company shall provide Acquirer
regular written updates on the status of the SBA Portfolio, including its
establishment of reserves with respect thereto, and such other information
the SBA Portfolio as Acquirer may request.

calculation of the Per Share Consideration and related estimates of the

basis as if the Closing had occurred on the Execution Date, which
illustrative calculations are set forth in the Payout Trial Run.

(f) _Cancellation._ Shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist.
Holders of shares of Company Common Stock will cease to be, and will have no
rights as, Stockholders, and certificates that represented shares of Company
Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Consideration. After the
Effective Time, there will be no transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Company, and
shares of Company Common Stock presented to the Surviving Company or Acquirer
will be canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Article III.

(1) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take, or cause to be taken,
all action, including causing the Company Board or any committee thereof
under any Company Stock Plan to take, or cause to be taken, all action
permitted under any Company Stock Plan or otherwise consented to by the
applicable Company Stock Option holder through the execution of an option
amendment substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ (a " _Company Stockholder
Option Amendment_ "), necessary to cause fifty percent (50%) of each option
holders outstanding Company Stock Option grants, whether vested or unvested
or exercisable or unexercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, to,
immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) be cancelled and terminated in a
manner satisfactory to Acquirer in its reasonable discretion and without any
consideration other than the right to receive a lump sum cash payment payable
to the holder of such Company Stock Option pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(2); and
(ii) no longer represent any rights to purchase or otherwise with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock or any other security of the Company,
Acquirer, the Surviving Company or any other person.

(2) Each holder of a Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, the exercise price per share
of which is less than the Merger Consideration Value Per Share (as defined
below) (for the avoidance of doubt, Company Stock Options shall not be
considered outstanding for these or any other purposes), shall be entitled to
receive from Acquirer in respect of and in consideration for the cancellation
and termination of each such Company Stock Option, as soon as reasonably

the Effective Time (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") and each such share of
Company Restricted Stock shall be an Exchangeable Share and converted into the
right to receive, in accordance with Section 3.1 above, the Per Share
Consideration, less all applicable Taxes.

Section 3.3 _Exchange Agent_.

 

(a) At or before the Effective Time, Acquirer will deposit with its transfer
agent or with a depository or trust institution of recognized standing
selected by it and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in such capacity,
the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "
_Old Certificates_ "), (1) evidence of shares in book entry form (" _New
Certificates_ "), representing the shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable to
holders of Old Certificates under this Section 3.3(a) and (2) an amount equal
to the aggregate cash payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.1(a) and Section 3.4.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in
no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Acquirer shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock, a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in
exchange for the consideration payable pursuant to this Article III. No
interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any New Certificate or cash to
be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. If any New Certificate is to
be issued or cash is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Old
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition to the exchange that the Old Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form of transfer, and that the person requesting the
exchange (1) pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of the New Certificate or the making of the cash payment in a name
other than the name of the holder of the surrendered Old Certificate or (2)
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Acquirer (or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be) that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquirer Common Stock
having a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to any holder of
Company Common Stock until such holder has surrendered the Old Certificate
representing such stock as provided herein. Subject to the effect of
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall
be paid to the holder of New Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously payable with respect to the shares of
Acquirer Common Stock represented thereby. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, holders of Company Common Stock who receive Acquirer Common
Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any
meeting of Acquirer stockholders the number of whole shares of Acquirer
Common Stock into which their respective shares of Company Common Stock are
converted, regardless of whether such holders of Company Common Stock have
exchanged their Old Certificates for New Certificates in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

(d) Acquirer shall be entitled to rely upon the Companys stock transfer books
to establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive consideration
pursuant to this Article III, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Old Certificate, Acquirer shall be entitled to deposit the
full consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third
party and thereafter be relieved from any and all liability and obligation
with respect to any claims thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no party hereto shall be liable to any former
holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(e) Each of Acquirer, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Acquirer, the Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any applicable Law and shall be entitled to
request and be provided any necessary forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the
appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar
information. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Acquirer, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect to whom such deduction and withholding was made by Acquirer, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent. If any holder of an Old Certificate
requests payment of any cash such person is entitled to pursuant to this
Section 3.3 by means of a wire transfer in his, her or its duly executed and
completed letter of transmittal, the Exchange Agent may make payment of such
cash such holder is entitled to hereunder by wire transfer in accordance with
such request and the cost of any such wire transfer shall be charged to the
account of and deducted from the proceeds paid to such holder hereunder.

(f) All shares of Per Share Consideration shall be subject to the
restrictions set forth in Section 6.13 and all New Certificates will bear the
Private Placement Legend to the extent provided for in Section 6.13.

 

Section 3.4 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock and no
certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will
be issued in the Merger; instead, Acquirer will pay to each holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of
Acquirer Common Stock an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fraction of a share of Acquirer Common Stock by the per share
volume weighted average price of Acquirer Common Stock on the trading day
immediately prior to the Closing as found on Bloombergs Volume Weighted
Average Price page or its equivalent successor page if such page is not
available.

 

Section 3.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against

 any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate,
Acquirer or its transfer agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate the shares of Acquirer Common Stock and any cash,
unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate been surrendered.

Board sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time
for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Acquirer Common Stock
outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, the amount of
Acquirer Common Stock included in the Stock Per Share Consideration will be
adjusted proportionately to account for such change.

Section 3.7  _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, Dissenting Shares
that are outstanding as of the Effective Time will not be converted into the
right to receive the consideration payable in respect of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof unless and until the holder shall have failed
to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his, her or its
right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL _._ The holder of any
Dissenting Share shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and, as applicable, shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted
to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect thereto _._
Acquirer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all
notices or other communications to be sent to holders of Dissenting Shares
and all such notices and other communications shall be satisfactory to
Acquirer _._ The Company will give Acquirer (a) prompt notice of any notice or
demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of demand for payment and any other similar instruments received
by the Company and (b) Acquirer shall direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands or notices _._ Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Acquirer, settle,
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands or notices or make or
offer to make any payment in respect of any such demands or notices _._
Acquirer will pay any consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of
applicable Law.

reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer prior to the distribution thereof.

Board shall not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquirer,
such recommendation; or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to

Agreement from complying with its obligations thereunder. Neither the Company
nor the Company Board shall submit any Acquisition Proposal other than the

Section 6.3 _Regulatory Applications; Third-Party Consents_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Acquirer and their respective
Subsidiaries will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to prepare as
promptly as practicable all documentation, to make all filings and submissions
(formal or informal) and to obtain all consents, approvals, permits and other
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities, including, but not limited
to, the approval of the Federal Reserve and the OCC under the BHC Act and the
National Bank Act, respectively, necessary to consummate the Core
Transactions, appointment of new directors and executive officers of Company
Bank and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Subsequent
Merger, or those the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material and adverse
effect on Acquirer or the Surviving Company (the " _Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ "), and to make and obtain all other Required Third-Party Consents.
The parties understand and agree that given the existing business and
regulatory posture of Acquirer and the fact that it is not an existing bank
holding company or bank and the complexity of the Core Transactions that the
process for obtaining the foregoing Requisite Regulatory Approvals may not
involve the customary path of filing formal applications at the earliest
opportunity and will be guided in part by the process suggested by the
Governmental Authorities responsible for the Requisite Regulatory Approvals;
notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquirer and the Company will use reasonable
best efforts to prepare and file with the Federal Reserve an SR 1212 filing
within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Agreement. Each of the Company
and Acquirer will have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable, each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the
Required Third-Party Consents, other than any information which is otherwise
confidential. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties will act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will
consult with the other party with respect to obtaining all material permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each party will keep the other party apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties shall discuss in advance the strategy and
timing for obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

(b) The Company and Acquirer will, upon request (but subject to applicable
confidentiality requirements), furnish the other party with all information
concerning itself, its affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary, proper, desirable or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its affiliates with or to any third party
or Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and to respond to any comment letters received in connection
therewith.

and its Representatives will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any

applicability of, any Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect.

such access as it may deem necessary and appropriate to conduct an audit or
audits of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective operations

which time the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the

to the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accrual) under the New Plans to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable Benefit Plan (except to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits), as if such service were with the
Surviving Company.

(c) If requested by Acquirer by no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon,
the Closing, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to

Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the right to any Parachute Payment
shall have been irrevocably waived by each of the applicable "disqualified
individuals" (as defined under Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) and (3) the Company shall have delivered to Acquirer
true and complete copies of all disclosure and documents that comprise the
stockholder approval of each Parachute Payment in sufficient time to allow
Acquirer to comment thereon but no less than five Business Days prior to the

in the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any

further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, subject to

   ##### Table of Contents

constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by the
Company, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by Acquirer, and which
is not cured within sixty (60) days following written notice to the Company,

transactions contemplated hereby, (2) any Law or Order shall have
been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any Governmental Authority
which prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or (3) any Requisite Regulatory

Governmental Authority unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory
Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein.

(d) _Delay of Regulatory Approval_. By Acquirer, upon payment by Acquirer to
the Company of a fee of $5,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available

with a breach of the obligations set forth in Section 6.5 and, after providing
Acquirer with written notice of such Superior Proposal and an opportunity to
make a counter proposal within five (5) Business Days of receipt by Acquirer
of such written notice, the Company Board determines, after considering in
good faith any counter proposal that Acquirer may have made pursuant to
Section 6.5 and after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company
FA, that the failure to accept such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under applicable
Law, (2) the Company pays to Acquirer an amount equal to the $5,000,000 fee,
if any, paid by Acquirer at the time Acquirer exercised its right to extend
the Outside Date pursuant to Section 8.1(e) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by Acquirer for that purpose, (3) the
Company pays Acquirer an additional fee of $5,000,000 by wire transfer of

further obligation under this Agreement, except that Section 6.7(b), Section

termination of this Agreement and (2) termination will not relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach by it of this Agreement.

Section 8.3  _Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that the Company or Acquirer has terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(3) and all the conditions to Closing, other than
Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.3(a), shall have been satisfied or capable of
being satisfied at such time (other than those conditions that by their nature
can only be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
thereof), and the terminating party has performed or complied with the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein, then Acquirer shall
pay to the Company a fee of $5,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by the Company for that purpose.

(b) Section 8.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and Section 8.3(b) of
the Acquirer Disclosure Schedule set out the account designated by the Company
or by Acquirer, as the case may be, into which any fee payable pursuant to
this Article VIII is to be deposited. Each of the Company or Acquirer may
change such designated account at any time upon prior written notice to the
other party.

(c) If any fee payable pursuant to this Article VIII has not been received by
the Company or Acquirer, as the case may be, by the date upon which such fee
becomes payable, interest shall accrue on such fee commencing on the day
following such date, at an annual rate equal to the prime rate, as published
in the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date that such fee was first required to
be paid to the Company or Acquirer, as the case may be.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Acquirer shall
not be obligated to pay more than one $5,000,000 fee pursuant to this Article
VIII, and the payment of any such fee shall constitute liquidated damages and
not a penalty and receipt of such fee by the Company shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for damages against Acquirer for any loss suffered by
the Company as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth herein or the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall not be obligated to pay more than one $5,000,000 fee pursuant to this
Article VIII, and the payment of any such fee shall constitute liquidated

sole and exclusive remedy for damages against the Company for any
loss suffered by Acquirer as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein or the failure of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated.

(f) Each of Acquirer and the Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either Acquirer or the Company
fails to pay any amount due pursuant to this Article VIII, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the party receiving the payment, as applicable, commences
a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the
party making the payment for any fee payable pursuant to this Article VIII or
any portion thereof, the party making the payment shall pay the costs and
expenses of the party receiving the payment, including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses, in connection with such suit.
