accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods indicated, except that the interim financial

from bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business, and the goods
and services involved have been sold and delivered or performed, as the case
may be, to the account obligors and no further filings (with governmental
agencies, insurers or others) are required to be made, no further goods are
required to be provided and no further services other than warranty services

consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles and to maintain accountability for its assets, and (C) access to
the Company\'s assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
authorization. To the Sellers\' Knowledge, there is not (x) any significant
deficiency in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, and summarize its
consolidated financial data or any material weaknesses in internal controls,
or (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls.
Since the Balance Sheet Date, there have been no significant changes in
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant

other Person of any source code owned by the Company and included in any
Products ("Company Source Code"). Schedule 4.10(d) lists all Products that are
or contains open source software or software that is distributed under a
licensing or distribution model that requires, as a condition of use,
modification and/or distribution of such software (or other software
incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such software) that the
software be disclosed or distributed in source code form, be licensed for the

Company's use and/or distribution of each component of Incorporated Open
Source Software with or in any Products complies with all material provisions
of the applicable license agreement, and in no case does such use or
distribution give rise under such license agreement to any obligation to

any such Company Source Code or other Intangible Rights owned by the Company
for the purpose of making derivative works, or to distribute any such Company
Source Code owned by the Company without charge.

insurance policies (including, without limitation, fire, commercial liability,
products liability, workers' compensation and vehicular) presently in effect
that relate to the Company and its properties. To Sellers\' Knowledge, such
policies are sufficient for compliance by the Company with all applicable
material Permits, Laws and Contracts. None of the insurance carriers has
indicated, in writing, to the Company an intention to cancel any such policy
or to materially increase any insurance premiums (including, without
limitation, workers' compensation premiums), or that any insurance required to
be listed on Schedule 4.11 will not be available in the future on
substantially the same terms as currently in effect. The Company does not have
any claim pending or anticipated against any of its insurance carriers under
any of such policies. During the prior five (5) years, (i) all notices

timely and duly given, and no insurance company has asserted, in writing, that
any claim is not covered by the applicable policy relating to such claim and

claims, actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (regardless of whether
formal or informal) against the Company pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge,
threatened in any court or before or by any Governmental Authority, or before
any arbitrator. Schedule 4.12 sets forth a true and correct listing of all
material actions, suits, and/or governmental investigations, claims or
proceedings that were pending, settled or adjudicated in the last five (5)
years. There are no outstanding orders, decrees, judgments, settlements,
stipulations or agreements issued or enforceable by any Governmental Authority
in any proceeding (or agreed to by any the Company) to which the Company is a
party which have not been complied with in full or which continue to impose
any obligations on the Company. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.12, neither
the Company nor any Seller has received any written opinion or memorandum or
legal advice from counsel to the effect that the Company is or may be exposed,
from a legal standpoint, to any material liability regarding any claims,
actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (regardless of whether formal or
informal) against the Company pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened.

4.13 Compliance with Laws; Permits.

a.The Company holds and is in compliance with all permits, certificates,
licenses, approvals, registrations and authorizations required by it under all
applicable laws and regulations in connection with the conduct of the Business
as presently conducted (collectively, "Permits"), except for those Permits the
failure of which to hold could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the
Company's ability to conduct the Business as presently conducted. Schedule

use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such other party in
attempting to secure any consents, waivers and approvals of any third 

party (including any Governmental Authority) required to be obtained to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such action
shall not include any requirement of any party hereto or its Affiliates
(including, as to the Sellers, the Company on or prior to the Closing Date) to
commence or participate in any Proceeding (except to the extent required to so
participate to comply with this Section), offer or grant any accommodation or
undertake any material obligation or liability (in each case financial or
otherwise) to any third party (including any Governmental Authority); provided
further, however, that, prior to the Closing, neither party nor its Affiliates
nor any of their respective officers, employees or authorized representatives
may contact any customer, supplier, independent service provider or lessor of
the Company, or any other third party (other than any Governmental Authority)
in connection with any such consent without the other party's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(b) Without limiting the generality of (but subject to) the foregoing, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining all necessary
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from all Governmental
Authorities and making all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities) and taking all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by,
any Governmental Authority (including those in connection with the HSR Act).
Buyer and Sellers shall keep the other party informed in all respects of any
substantive communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, any Governmental Authority and of any substantive communication received
or given in connection with any Proceeding by a private party relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall permit the other party to review
any substantive communication delivered to, and consult with the other party
in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Authority
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in connection
with any Proceeding by a private party, and shall give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences (to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or private party). No party to
this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any Governmental Authority
without the consent of the other party to this Agreement, which consent shall

prior to the date hereof, the parties hereto shall cooperate with each other

promptly as practicable to all requests or inquiries received from the FTC or
DOJ for additional documentation or information. Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of all filing
fees payable to any Governmental Authority in connection with any required
Governmental Order, including the filing fee required in connection with the
HSR Act filing.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, Buyer and the Sellers shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections,
if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
sale of the Purchased Shares under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
any other United States federal or state or foreign or supranational Laws that
are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of 

monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Competition Laws"). In
connection therewith, if any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the sale of the Purchased Shares as violative of any
Competition Laws, Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to vigorously contest and resist
any such Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the sale of the Purchased Shares, including by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. Buyer
and the Sellers shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws with respect to the sale
of the Purchased Shares as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
"commercially reasonable efforts" shall not require Buyer or the Company to
divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take
any actions that would limit Buyer's or its Affiliates' freedom of action with
respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Company, Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates.

(e) Buyer and the Sellers shall promptly notify the other of any Proceeding
that shall be instituted or threatened against such party to restrain,
prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

7.05 Notice of Developments.

(a) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer in writing
if there shall be (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which has
caused any of their or the Company's representations or warranties contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect and (ii) any failure on their
or its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by their or it hereunder. Should any such event,
fact or condition require any change to the Disclosure Schedule, Sellers shall
promptly deliver to Buyer a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule specifying
such change. In the event that Sellers deliver one or more supplements to the
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Section 7.05(a) that reflect any events,
facts or conditions which individually or in the aggregate would cause the
conditions set forth in Sections 8.03(a) or 8.03(b) not to be satisfied, Buyer
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to that
effect.

(b) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers in writing
if Buyer becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or
the existence of any fact or condition that would cause or constitute a breach
of any of its representations or warranties had any such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of Buyer's discovery of such event, fact or
condition and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder.

7.06 Publicity. None of the parties shall issue or make, or cause to have
issued or made, any public release or announcement concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the advance approval in
writing of the form and substance thereof by Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative, except as required by law or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange or market (in which case, so far as possible, there shall be
consultation among the parties prior to such announcement), and the parties
shall endeavor jointly to agree on the text of any announcement or circular so
approved or required. 

7.07 401K Plan. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will take all
necessary and appropriate action to terminate, effective as of a date prior to
the Closing Date, the Company's existing 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") and
authorize the Sellers to take all action necessary or appropriate on the
Company's behalf to complete the responsibilities of this Section 7.07. In
addition, immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall make a
contribution the 401(k) Plan reasonably estimated to be consistent with the
Company's expected contribution to the 401(k) Plan for compensation paid to
participants prior to the effective date of the termination of the 401(k)
Plan. As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing, the
Sellers shall cause the trustee of the 401(k) Plan to take all necessary and
appropriate steps to complete the termination of the 401(k) Plan, including,
without limitation, (i) determining the amount of and making any remaining
contributions required to be made to the 401(k) Plan in accordance with its
terms in amounts sufficient to satisfy any non-discrimination requirement of
the plan and (ii) filing a determination letter application (IRS Form 5310)
with the IRS. The costs (excluding any contributions, penalties, interest, or
similar amounts, which shall be paid by Sellers') required for the
administration and termination of the 401(k) Plan, including without
limitation, any remaining amounts that must be contributed to the plan, costs
related to the preparation of Forms 5500, annual valuations, and the Forms
5310, and any costs relating to the distribution of benefits to participants
and beneficiaries under the plan, shall be promptly paid in their entirety by
the Company. The Sellers, on behalf of the Company, shall cause the trustee of
the 401(k) Plan to distribute the assets of the plan to the participants of
the plan in accordance with their respective account balances no later than
120-days after the receipt of a favorable IRS determination letter (the
"401(k) Plan Distribution Deadline"). The Sellers agree to keep the Company
and the Buyer informed of the progress and status of the activities outlined
in this Section 7.07 and to provide copies of all notices, and filing provided
to or from any Person, entity, agency, or authority. Upon the reasonable
request of Sellers, the parties agree to cause the Company to cooperate with
the Sellers and trustee of the plan to accomplish the tasks set forth in this
Section 7.07. The parties agree that the Escrow Amount may, at the Company's
option, be utilized, but shall not be the sole source of funds, to satisfy any
shortfall in the funding of the plan, if and to the extent the assets of the
plan are not sufficient to satisfy all benefits and other liabilities and
obligations under the plan on or before the 401(k) Plan Distribution Date. The
parties agree that any shortfall in the funding of the plan if and to the
extent the assets of the plan are not sufficient to satisfy all benefits and
other liability and obligations under the plan on or before the 401(k) Plan
Distribution Deadline shall constitute an indemnifiable claim under Section
10.02, to which the Deductible Amount and the Cap described in Section 10.04
shall not apply.

7.08 Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director,
employee, agent, partner, affiliate or otherwise, solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any person or
entity relating, with respect to the Company, to any (i) liquidation,
dissolution or recapitalization, (ii) merger or consolidation, (iii)
acquisition or purchase of any of the assets of the Company, other than sales
of products and services in the ordinary course of business, or any of the
outstanding equity interests, or (iv) a transaction similar to the
transactions described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section or
business combination (a "Competing Transaction"), nor participate in any or
continue any ongoing discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other person or entity any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate
in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or knowingly
encourage, any effort or attempt by any person or entity to effect a Competing
Transaction. The Company shall, and shall direct all Persons acting on behalf
of it (including the Shareholders) to immediately cease any existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any Persons with respect to any
of the foregoing.

considering engaging in any facet of the Business within the Territory, or (C)
utilize its special knowledge of the Business and their relationships with
customers, suppliers and others, or assist any other Person or divert business
away from the Company or any of its Affiliates in any facet of the Business;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent Seller or
any Principal, from passive acquisition through market purchases and passive
ownership of equity securities of any class of any issuer which is a public
corporation in an amount less than 2% of the outstanding stock thereof.



b.Without the prior consent of Buyer, no Seller may, for a period of seven (7)
years from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for itself, himself, or
herself, or for any other Person, (i) call on or solicit any of the (x)
consultants which provided sales or engineering services or (y) employees of
Company or its Affiliates (or any Person who had been such an employee or
consultant in the preceding three (3) years) for purposes of entering into
employment, consulting or other business arrangements with such Persons, (ii)
call on or solicit any of the actual or targeted prospective customers or
clients of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company for the purposes of
competing with the Company or any of its Affiliates for the business of such
actual or targeted prospective customers or clients regarding matters that are
related to the Business, nor shall any Seller make known the names and
addresses of such customers or clients or any information relating in any
manner to the Company's trade or business relationships with such customers or
clients as they directly pertain to the Business or (iii) hire any Person who
was employed or engaged as a consultant by the Business at any time in the
seven (7) years prior to the date of this Agreement.



c.Each Seller shall, and shall cause each of its, his, or her Affiliates and
their employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel and other representatives
and advisers to, hold in strict confidence all, and not divulge or disclose,
use, or misuse in any way, (i) any Confidential Information; or (ii) the
existence or contents of this Agreement, or any information concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the foregoing
obligation of confidence shall not apply to information that is required to be
disclosed by Sellers, or Affiliates or any of its, his, or her employees,
agents, accountants, legal counsel or other representatives or advisers as a
result of any Law, in which case the Sellers, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify Buyer of any such proposed disclosure, shall cooperate with
Buyer to obtain a protective order for such Confidential Information and shall
not disclose any more information than is required pursuant to such Law and
provided further, however, for sole purpose of proper filing and tax returns
and responding to inquiries of tax authorities, the foregoing obligation of
confidence shall not apply to any items which are required to be disclosed on
any tax return.



d.Each Seller acknowledges that the Company conducts the Business throughout
the Territory and that they have full and complete access to the Company's
Trade Secrets, Confidential Information and employee, customer and supplier
relationships. Accordingly, each Seller agrees that the Territory, time
limitation and scope of restrictions set forth in this Section 7.09(a) are
reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the
Company and to protect the benefit of Buyer's bargain and the goodwill of the
Company. Each Seller agrees that any reduction to the Territory, time
limitation or scope of restrictions set forth herein would seriously undermine
the efficacy of this Section 7.09(a) and the protections that it is intended
to provide. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants contained
in this Section 7.09(a) are essential elements of this Agreement and that, but
for these covenants Buyer would not have agreed to purchase the Purchased
Shares. Each Seller further expressly agrees and acknowledges that (a) the
confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition covenants contained in
this Section 7.09(a): (i) are reasonable and necessary for the protection of
Buyer with respect to the covenants' respective stated purposes, time, scope
and geographic area, and are supported by adequate consideration, (ii) are
necessary for the protection of the Company's legitimate business interests,
including the Trade Secrets, goodwill and relationships with customers and
suppliers purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) are not
unduly restrictive of any rights of any Seller, (b) each Seller has sufficient
business alternatives and sufficient assets, taking into account the Purchase
Price and other consideration received and to be received, directly or
indirectly, by Sellers, such that Sellers do not have to compete with the
Company or impermissibly use its confidential, proprietary or Trade Secret
information described in this Agreement in order to conduct its business, and
(c) in entering into and negotiating this Agreement and the terms hereof,
there has been no disparity in bargaining power between the parties and
Sellers have been represented by counsel and fully understand the terms
hereof. The existence of any claim or cause of action against the Company,
Buyer or their Affiliates by Sellers or their Affiliates, whether predicated
on Buyer's breach of this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by Buyer of the covenants contained in this Section
7.09(a). If any covenant or restriction contained in this Section 7.09(a), or
any part thereof, is hereafter construed or found to be invalid or
unenforceable in part or in whole, this shall not affect the remainder of the
covenants or restrictions, which shall be given full effect, without regard to
the invalid or unenforceable portions, and any court having jurisdiction shall
enforce such invalid or unenforceable covenant or restriction to the maximum
extent possible under applicable Laws, including the maximum permissible time,
scope and geographic area for such covenant or restriction.



b.Standstill. Each Seller hereby agrees that for a period ending on the date
which is seven (7) years from the Closing none of them nor any Affiliate,
successor or assign of any of them (regardless of whether such Person is an
Affiliate on the date hereof) will (a) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to
acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, control of HEICO
Corporation, (b) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, as
advisor or otherwise, in any "solicitation" of "proxies" or consents to vote
(as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Security and Exchange
Commission), or seek to advise or influence any Person with respect to the
voting of any voting securities of HEICO Corporation, in opposition to any
proposed actions of the Board of Directors of HEICO Corporation or in
opposition to any nominees for Directors of HEICO Corporation which nominees
have been nominated by HEICO Corporation, its management or its Board of
Directors, (c) seek or assist any other party in seeking representation on the
Board of Directors of HEICO Corporation through the election to the Board of
Directors of individuals(s) not nominated and supported by HEICO Corporation,
its management and Board of Directors, (d) pursue or publicly announce an
interest in pursuing an acquisition of control of HEICO Corporation or an
alteration of the composition of HEICO Corporation's Board of Directors or (e)
advise or otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, directly or
indirectly, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors
or policies of HEICO Corporation. 



c.Injunction. It is recognized and hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto
that a breach or violation by one or more of the Sellers of any or all of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 7.09 will cause irreparable
harm and damage to Buyer, the Company and their Affiliates in a monetary
amount which will be virtually impossible to ascertain. As a result, each
Seller recognizes and hereby acknowledges that Buyer shall be entitled to an
injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining and restraining
any breach or violation of, or threatened breach or violation of, any or all
of the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 7.09 by Sellers or
their associates, Affiliates, partners or agents, either directly or
indirectly, and that such right to injunction shall be cumulative and in
addition to whatever other rights or remedies Buyer may possess hereunder, at
law, or in equity. Nothing contained in this Section 7.09 shall be construed
to prevent Buyer from seeking and recovering from the Sellers damages
sustained by it as a result of any breach or violation by such Person of any
of the covenants or agreements contained herein.



d.Restrictive Covenants. To the extent that any employee or independent
contractor or other Person is subject to a non-compete, restrictive covenant,
assignment of intellectual property rights, non-solicitation or similar
agreement which relates to the Business, and an Affiliate of Sellers is a
party thereto, Sellers shall cause, at Company\'s expense, all rights and
benefits thereof to be conveyed to Buyer (and if such conveyance is not
enforceable or feasible, then Sellers shall enforce same only in the manner
and to the extent directed by Buyer).



7.10 Release. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself,
himself, herself, and their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, do
hereby release and forever discharge the Company, Buyer (only in Buyer's
capacity as a shareholder of the Company) and their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees, successors and assigns,
as applicable, of and from any and all claims, actions, causes of action,
demands, suits, covenants, agreements, representations, obligations, costs,
liabilities, expenses, losses and debts of any nature whatsoever, both at law
and in equity, relating to any matter, claim or right, whether presently known
or unknown, which it now has, ever had or may have against such released
parties arising from or relating to any facts or events occurring at or prior
to the Closing other than (a) those obligations arising under this Agreement
or under any document executed in connection herewith, (b) accrued but unpaid
compensation, (c) outstanding benefits under the employee benefit plans of the
Company, (d) claims of a Seller in his capacity as a director or officer for
indemnity against third party claims, or (e) any claims under any insurance
policy maintained by the Company.



7.11 Mail and Misdirected Payments. If any Seller or any of their Affiliates
receive any mail, courier package, telegraph message, facsimile transmission,
purchase order, service request or other document or communication that
relates to the Company or the Business, such documents and communications
shall be promptly forwarded to Buyer, either in hand or using a nationally
recognized overnight delivery service for next-day delivery. If following the
Closing, Sellers (or any of their Affiliates) receives a payment belonging to
the Company, Sellers shall promptly turn such payment over to the Company.



7.12 Tax Covenants.



(a)All transfer, documentary, recording, sales (including bulk sales), use,
value added, ad valorem, privilege, registration and other such Taxes
(including all applicable stock transfer Taxes) and any penalties, interest
and additions to such Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement shall
be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers. Each party to this Agreement shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects in the timely making of all filings,
returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection therewith. 



(b)[reserved].



(c)Sellers, at the Sellers' expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including any Tax Return
relating to any "S corporation" short taxable year of the Company). All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice
unless otherwise required under applicable Law. At least 30 Business Days
prior to the due date for any such Tax Returns, the Sellers shall deliver such
Tax Returns to the Buyer for its review, comment and approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other tax items
for such periods on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Schedule
K-1s furnished by the Company to the Sellers for such periods. The Sellers
shall be responsible for and shall pay any and all Taxes (i) shown on such Tax
Returns or (ii) assessed against or imposed on the Company with respect to all
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and any and all Taxes
of the Company for the period allocated to the Sellers pursuant to Section
7.12(d) during the three-year plus 90 day period immediately following the
filing date for the Federal income tax return of the Company for year 2017;
provided, however, that, (1) such responsibility and commitment to pay shall
be net of any refunds or credits to the benefit of Company with respect to any
taxable year or period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before the Closing
Date or with respect to the pre-Closing period of any Straddle Period, and (2)
Sellers shall not be liable for or pay any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are
paid (or remitted) by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date or are
reflected as a liability or reserve for Taxes in the Net Working Capital. Any
payment required by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 7.12(c) shall be paid
to the Company not later than five (5) days before the due date for payment of
Taxes with respect to such Tax Return, assessment or imposition.



(d)Buyer and Sellers will, unless prohibited by applicable Law, close the
taxable period of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date
and shall execute and deliver an election to close the books of the Company
upon S corporation termination pursuant to Section 1362(e)(3), in connection
therewith. If applicable Law does not permit the Company to close its taxable
year on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with
respect to a taxable period which includes the Closing Date (but does not
begin or end on that day) (a "Straddle Period"), the Taxes, if any,
attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to the Sellers for
the period up to and including the Closing Date, and (ii) to the Buyer for the
period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or deductions
required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be
made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) and any real property, personal property and other
Taxes not imposed on the basis of income or receipts shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period.



(e)Buyer, Company and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer, Company and Sellers
agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the 

statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Body.



(f)In the case of any inquiry, audit, claim for refund, or administrative or
judicial proceeding involving any asserted or threatened Tax liability or
refund with respect to the Company (any such audit, claim for refund, or
proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability referred to herein as a
"Contest") initiated after the Closing Date that relates to Taxes for which
the Sellers are responsible under Sections 7.12., 7.13, or 10.02, the Sellers
shall have the right to control the conduct of such Contest at their own
expense, but the Buyer shall have the right to participate in such Contest at
its own expense, and the Sellers shall (i) keep Buyer fully informed regarding
the status of such Contest, (ii) consult with the Buyer with respect to any
issues raised in such Contest which could adversely affect the Company or its
Affiliates or which could impact Tax periods (or portions thereof) after the
Closing and (iii) not be able to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion
of such Contest that may affect the Tax liability of the Company for any
taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without the
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, that, that if the Sellers fail to assume control of the
conduct of any such Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt
by the Sellers of notice of such Contest, the Buyer shall have the right to
assume control of such Contest and shall be able to settle, compromise and/or
concede such Contest in its sole discretion in good faith. In the event any
party receives any notice from a Governmental Body regarding a Contest, such
party shall promptly provide the other party with a copy of such notice and
all related communications. A party's failure to give prompt notice shall not
constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any Indemnity Claim by the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, except and only to the
extent that such failure shall have caused or increased such liability or
adversely affected the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or
reduce its liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to settle any Contest without
the prior written consent of Sellers\' Representative, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.



(g)The Company shall not amend any Tax Returns for periods prior to the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.



7.13 Section 338(h)(10) Election.



a.The Sellers shall join with the Buyer in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder and any
corresponding or similar elections under state, local or foreign Tax law

acquisition of the Purchased Shares by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on the Tax Returns to the
extent permitted by applicable law.



(b) The Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms

Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer two copies of IRS Form 8023 (or
successor form) and any applicable similar forms required by state or local
law fully completed with respect to the purchase of the Purchased Shares by
the Buyer and executed by each Seller. The Sellers shall execute and deliver
to the Buyer such additional documents or forms as are reasonably requested to
complete properly the Section 338(h)(10) Election at least sixty (60) days
prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10) Election is required to be filed. 



(c) Attached hereto as Schedule 7.13(c) is the allocation of "adjusted gross-
up basis" (within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of
the Code), subject to revision to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase
Price in accordance with Section 2.03. The Buyer and the Sellers shall file
all Tax Returns and statements, forms and schedules in connection therewith in
a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and such Schedule
6.04(c) and shall take no tax position contrary thereto unless required to do
so by a retroactive amendment to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code after the
Closing Date or pursuant to an order of the Internal Revenue Service.



(d) The Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay their proportion of any
and all Taxes arising as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
including (i) any state or local transfer, sales or use, or similar fees or
Taxes, (ii) any income or franchise Taxes imposed on the Company and (iii) any
income, franchise or similar taxes imposed by any state, local or foreign
taxing authority as a result of any election under Section 338(g) of the Code
(or any comparable election under state, local or foreign law) if such state,
local or foreign taxing authority does not allow or respect a Section
338(h)(10) Election (or any comparable or resulting election under state,
local or foreign law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Common
Stock of the Company as contemplated hereby.



7.14 Earn-Out



(a)Buyer shall keep separate accounting books and records for the Company for
all periods applicable to the calculation of the Earn-Out Amount, which
accounting books and records shall be in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied in accordance with applicable requirements of law applicable to Buyer.
Sellers' Representative shall be entitled, upon reasonable prior notice and at
reasonable times and in accordance with reasonable confidentiality
requirements specified by Buyer, to review such accounting books and records
and to make and retain copies thereof and extracts therefrom solely for the
purpose of the calculation of the Earn-Out Amount, all in a manner consistent
with applicable requirements of law applicable to Buyer.



(b)Buyer shall deliver to Sellers' Representative within sixty (60) days after
the first day of the first calendar month after the sixth anniversary of the
Closing a notice (a "Buyer's Earn-Out Notice") containing the calculation of
the Company's Earn-Out Amount. Unless Sellers' Representative, within forty-
five (45) days after the delivery to him of such Buyer's Earn-Out Notice,
delivers a notice to Buyer stating that Sellers' Representative objects to any
item or computation in connection with the calculation therein, and specifying
in reasonable detail the basis for such objection, such calculation as set
forth in such Buyer's Earn-Out Notice shall be binding upon the parties. If
Sellers' Representative and Buyer are unable to agree upon such calculation
within thirty (30) days after any timely notice of objection has been given by
Sellers' Representative to Buyer, the Settlement Accountants shall resolve the
disputed items or computations and determine the Earn-Out Amount, if any,
based on its resolution of the disputed items or computations within thirty
(30) days after its acceptance of its appointment. Any determination by the
Settlement Accountants shall be binding upon the parties. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Settlement Accountants selected in the event of a dispute
shall be borne in a manner consistent with that set forth in Section
2.03(d)(ii).



(c)Subject to any amounts to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section
10.07, Buyer shall pay such Earn-Out Amount, if any, within ten business days

Buyer shall sell the business of the Company to an unaffiliated third party
such that after giving effect to such sale, (x) neither Buyer nor an Affiliate
of Buyer shall own at least a majority of the capital or voting stock of the
Company or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company shall
have been transferred to one or more Persons who are neither Buyer nor an
Affiliate of Buyer (such event, an "Early Trigger Earn-Out Transaction"), then
the following provisions shall apply:



(i) In the case of an Early Trigger Earn-Out Transaction which occurs during
the Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the Gain on Sale; provided,
however, that the portion of the Gain on Sale payable to Sellers shall in no
event exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000). "Gain on Sale" shall mean
the portion of the Enterprise Value which exceeds the sum of (x) $316,500,000,
plus (y) all capital invested in the Company following the Closing by Buyer
and/or any Affiliate of Buyer.

(ii) In the event of an Early Trigger Earn-Out Transaction occurring during
the Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers' Representative within
sixty (60) days after the consummation of the Early Trigger Earn-Out
Transaction a notice, certified as correct by an officer of Buyer, containing
the calculation of the Gain on Sale (a "Gain on Sale Notice"). Unless the
Sellers' Representative, within forty-five (45) days after the delivery to him
of such Gain on Sale Notice, delivers a notice to Buyer stating that the
Sellers' Representative objects to any item or computation in connection with
the calculation therein, and specifying in reasonable detail the basis for
such objection, such calculation as set forth in the Gain on Sale Notice shall
be binding upon the parties, absent fraud. If Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative are unable to agree upon such calculation within thirty (30)
days after any timely notice of objection has been given by the Sellers'
Representative to Buyer, the Settlement Accountants shall resolve the disputed
items or computations and determine the Gain on Sale, if any, within thirty
(30) days after their acceptance of appointment in such capacity. Buyer and
Sellers' Representative shall provide to the Settlement Accountants all work
papers and back-up materials relating to the disputed items or computations
requested by the Settlement Accountants to the extent reasonably available to
Buyer or the Sellers' Representative or their respective representatives and
the review by the Settlement Accountants shall be limited to such disputed
items or computations. The Settlement Accountants shall act as an expert, and
not as an arbitrator, to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative, on the other hand,
and not by independent investigation, the disputed items or computations and
shall be instructed that its calculation (A) must be made in accordance with
the historical tax accounting principles used by Buyer and its consolidated
tax group for purposes of calculating and reporting to the IRS the Company's
and such group's income tax liability, and (B) with respect to each disputed
item or computation, must be within the range of values established for such
amount as determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by the
Sellers' Representative in the notice of disagreement and by the Buyer in the
Gain on Sale Notice. Any determination by the Settlement Accountants shall be
binding upon the parties, absent fraud. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Settlement Accountants selected in the event of a dispute shall be borne in a
manner consistent with that set forth in Section 2.03(d)(ii).

(iii) Subject to any amounts to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section
10.07, Buyer shall pay the Gain on Sale as calculated in accordance with this
Section 7.14(d), if any, within ten (10) Business Days after the Sellers'
Representative\'s acceptance of, or the final resolution by the Settlement
Accountants of, the Gain on Sale, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Sellers, in proportion to their ownership of the Company at the
Closing. Upon payment of the Gain on Sale as provided in this Section 7.14(d),
neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall have any further obligation
to pay any Earn-Out Amount.

further, that the representations in Section 4.16 (Environmental Matters)
shall survive until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. None of the
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement will survive the
Closing Date other than those which by their terms contemplate performance
after the Closing Date, and each such surviving covenant and agreement will
survive the Closing for the period contemplated by its terms. The right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations will not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations. If Buyer or the
Sellers, as applicable, provides proper notice of a claim within the
applicable time period set forth above, then liability and time limitations of
this Section 10.01 for such claim will continue until such claim is resolved.



10.02 Indemnification By the Sellers. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article X, from and after the Closing, each Seller will
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and each of the Buyer's parents,
subsidiaries, employees, officers, directors, partners, agents, advisors,
representatives, and affiliates (individually, a "Buyer Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any Buyer Indemnified Party
based upon, arising, directly or indirectly, out of, with respect to, or by
reason of:



i.(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of the Sellers contained in Article IV or (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any of the representations or warranties of the Sellers contained in Article V
of this Agreement or any certificate or schedule hereto;

ii.any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement, or obligation to
be performed by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate or
schedule hereto;

iii.any and all Taxes, due or claimed to be due, by any applicable authority
in respect of or attributable to any and all periods ending on or before the
Closing Date (including the portion of any Straddle Period ending on, and
including, the Closing Date), or as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby;

iv.the matter disclosed as item 4 on Schedule 4.12; or

v.any and all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments or judgments,
costs and expenses incidental to any of the foregoing.

The obligations of the Sellers' to indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified
Parties harmless under clause (a)(i), (c) and (d) (and clause (e) with respect
to a claim under clause (a)(i), (c) or (d)) shall be joint and several. All
other obligations to indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless
shall be several as to such Seller only. 

10.03 Indemnification By the Buyer. Subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Article X, the Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
the Sellers and each of their respective parents, subsidiaries, employees,
officers, directors, partners, members, managers, trustees, agents, advisors,
representatives, and affiliates (each a "Seller Indemnified Party"), from and
against any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any
Selling Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of:



i.any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
the Buyer contained in Article VI this Agreement; or

ii.any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement, or obligation to
be performed by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

10.04 Certain Limitations.



i.The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article X shall apply only
if the total Losses with respect to such matters exceed the Deductible Amount,
provided, that if the aggregate damages exceed the Deductible Amount, the
Claiming Party shall only be entitled to recover their Losses in excess of the
Deductible Amount. Subject to the provisions of Subsection 10.04(c) below,
Selling Parties' indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the Cap.

ii.For the purpose of determining the amount of Losses resulting from (but not
for the purpose of determining the existence of) an inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty hereunder, any such inaccuracy or breach shall
be determined without regard to any materiality or other similar qualification
contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

iii.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Deductible Amount and
the Cap will not apply to any breach of the Fundamental Representations, a
breach of the Sellers' obligations under Section 7.15, or for any matter
involving or alleging Fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

iv.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any claim for Losses
payable under this Article X shall be net of any insurance proceeds actually
received by such Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses (after
deducting the amounts of policy deductibles, self‑insured retentions and any
out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the recovery of
such proceeds). If a Claiming Party obtains such recoveries (net of any
collection expense) after the Indemnifying Party makes any indemnification
payment with respect to the same Losses, then such Claiming Party shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the amount of such recoveries it
actually received (after deducting therefrom any costs incurred in collecting
such insurance proceeds), but not in excess of the sum of (i) aggregate of all
amounts previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Claiming Party in respect of such Losses and (ii) all other amounts expended
by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of
matter(s) giving rise to such Losses.

10.05 Third Party Claims. An indemnified party hereunder (the "Claiming
Party") shall give the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt
written notice of any claim of a third party (a "Third Party Claim") as to
which the Claiming Party proposes to demand indemnification hereunder,
specifying the amount and nature of such claim. The failure to give such
notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced thereby,
and then only to the extent of such prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall
forthwith be entitled to assume the Good Faith Defense of such Third Party
Claim at its own expense, provided, that the Claiming 

Party may retain its own counsel at the Indemnifying Party's expense with
respect to such Third Party Claim, unless the Claiming Party should have
reasonably concluded that the interests of the Claiming Party and the
Indemnifying Party do not create a conflict which the Claiming Party
reasonably believes would conflict with the Indemnifying Party's defense
thereof. By virtue of the Indemnifying Party's assumption of the Good Faith
Defense of a Third Party Claim, the parties shall be deemed to have agreed as
follows: (x) no compromise or settlement of such claims or action may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Claiming Party's consent; and
(z) the Claiming Party will have no liability or adverse consequence with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims or action effected
without the Claiming Party's consent, unless in each instance the settlement
involves only payment of money to the other party and a full release of claims
against the Claiming Party is provided in such settlement. For purposes
hereof, "Good Faith Defense" means legal defense conducted by reputable
counsel of good standing selected with the consent of the Claiming Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If a Good Faith
Defense is not commenced within ten business days following receipt of notice
of the Third Party Claim from the Claiming Party (or such shorter period, if
any, during which a defense must be commenced in order for the defendant to
preserve its rights), or upon written notice of the Claiming Party at any
time, the Claiming Party may, at its option, settle or defend such claim at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party without the consent of the Indemnifying
Party. At the Indemnifying Party's expense (which shall be joint and several
if there is more than one), the parties shall provide such cooperation and
such access to their books, records and properties as any party shall
reasonably request with respect to such matter; and the parties hereto agree
to cooperate with each other in all respects in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense thereof and in furtherance of seeking a mutually acceptable
solution. With regard to Third Party Claims for which indemnification is
payable hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the entry of a judgment against the
Claiming Party and the expiration of any applicable appeal period, or if
earlier, ten days prior to the date that the judgment creditor has the right
to execute the judgment; (b) the entry of an nonappealable judgment or final
appellate decision against the Claiming Party; (c) a settlement of the Third
Party Claim; or (d) with respect to indemnities for Tax liabilities, upon the
issuance of any binding resolution or settlement by a Tax authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, expenses of counsel to the Claiming Party which
are subject to indemnification hereunder shall be reimbursed on a current
basis by the Indemnifying Party. All indemnification claims not paid when due
shall bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of the Prime Rate plus 3%
per annum or the highest rate permitted by law.



10.06 Notice. In addition to and not in limitation of this Article X, a
Claiming Party hereunder shall give prompt written notice to an Indemnifying
Party of each claim for indemnification hereunder as to which such Claiming
Party proposes to demand indemnification, specifying the amount and nature of
such claim. The failure to give such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder unless the
Indemnifying Party was prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent of such
prejudice.



10.07 Set-off Rights, Etc. Buyer and its Affiliates may, at Buyer's election,
set-off against the Purchase Price Adjustment, the Escrow Amount, and any
Earn-Out Amount, for any Losses for which the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates may be responsible under this Agreement (provided Buyer shall
comply with the procedures in the Escrow Agreement regarding use of the Escrow
Amount pay such Losses). In the event Buyer elects to set-off hereunder and
the amounts subject to set-off are insufficient to satisfy all Losses as to
which claims may be made against such amounts, then Buyer may take any action
or exercise any remedy available to it by appropriate legal proceedings to
collect same. The indemnification and set-off provisions in this Article X are
in addition to, and not in derogation of any statutory, equitable or common
law remedy any party may have with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto agree that the
finalization and payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment under Article 

II shall in no way limit any right of Buyer to be indemnified by Sellers
pursuant to this Article X (including, but not limited to, the right of Buyer
to be indemnified by Sellers for any breach of or any inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty), except no indemnification shall be payable to the
extent any such liability is included in such Purchase Price Adjustment.



10.08 Release of Escrow Amount. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
date which is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date (the "Escrow
Release Date"), Sellers shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Agent an
amount equivalent to (i) the Escrow Amount minus (ii) all retentions and
reductions to which Buyer is entitled as Purchase Price Adjustment, or any
undisputed indemnified claims pursuant to this Article X, minus (iii) any
amounts which may be reasonably necessary to satisfy any unresolved indemnity
claims theretofore asserted by any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this Article X
(such amounts relating to such unresolved claims are collectively referred to
hereinafter as the "Unresolved Portion"). If there is an Unresolved Portion as
of the Escrow Release Date, Escrow Agent shall continue to retain the
Unresolved Portion from and after the Escrow Release Date until the resolution
of such claims giving rise to the Unresolved Portion, and following the final
settlement of each such claim, Sellers shall be entitled to receive the
balance, if any, of the Unresolved Portion allocated to such claim.



ARTICLE XI 
SELLERS' REPRESENTATIVE



11.01 Sellers' Representative Appointment and Duties. Yosef (Joseph) Klein is
hereby appointed the exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for each of
the Sellers and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the
Sellers shall constitute the appointment of Yosef (Joseph) Klein as Sellers'
Representative by and the ratification of the Sellers' Representative's
authority by each such Seller, pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.
The Sellers' Representative shall have the authority to act for and on behalf
of each of the Sellers as provided herein, including (i) to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, including executing and delivering the
Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or changes therein as to which the
Sellers' Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have consented); (ii)
to receive on behalf of and distribute the Net Purchase Price and any Purchase
Price Adjustment to the Sellers; (iii) to communicate to, and receive all
communications and notices from, Buyer and/or the Company; (iv) to do each and
every act, implement any decision and exercise any and all rights which the
Sellers are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement; (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of the Sellers any
amendment or waiver hereto or to the Escrow Agreement; (vi) to negotiate,
settle, compromise and otherwise handle any post-Closing adjustments and all
claims for indemnification made by any Buyer Indemnified Party; (vii) to
authorize delivery to an Indemnified Party of any funds and property in its
possession or in the possession of the Escrow Agent in satisfaction of claims
by such Indemnified Party; (viii) to object to any deliveries by Buyer
hereunder; (ix) to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and commence, prosecute, defend, participate in, settle, dismiss or
otherwise terminate, as applicable, any litigation, action, proceeding or
investigation relating to the Company, the Purchased Shares, the Sellers, this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and to comply with orders of courts
and awards of courts, mediators and arbitrators with respect to such
litigation, action, proceeding or investigation; and (x) to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders,
receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock
powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things
and to take any and all actions that the Sellers' Representative, in his sole
discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with
or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Sellers' Representative shall, in this regard, have all of the
rights and powers which the Sellers would otherwise have, and the Sellers
agree that Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon
all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers' Representative 

pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any of the foregoing matters. The
Sellers' Representative shall for all purposes be deemed the sole authorized
agent of the Sellers until such time as the agency is terminated. Each of the
Sellers agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are
therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers' Representative and
shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of
any of the Sellers. All decisions and actions (including documents executed
and delivered) by the Sellers' Representative with respect to the matters
described above in this Section 11.01 shall be binding upon all of the
Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.



11.02 Resignation or Removal of the Sellers' Representative. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Sellers' Representative as provided
below, the Sellers' Representative may resign at any time thirty (30) days
after giving notice thereof to the Sellers. Upon any such resignation, the
Sellers may appoint a successor Sellers' Representative by a vote of the
Persons who were the holders of majority of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company (on a fully diluted, as converted basis) as of
immediately prior to the Closing. If no successor Sellers' Representative
shall have been appointed by the Sellers and accepted such appointment within
twenty (20) days after the retiring Sellers' Representative's giving of notice
of resignation, then the retiring Sellers' Representative may, on behalf of
the Sellers, appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
the Sellers' Representative hereunder, such successor Sellers' Representative
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Sellers' Representative, and the
retiring Sellers' Representative shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Sellers' Representative's
resignation hereunder as the Sellers' Representative, the provisions of
Section 11.01 shall continue in effect for such retiring Sellers'
Representative's benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was acting as the Sellers' Representative.



ARTICLE XII

12.07 Exhibits and Schedules. The exhibits and schedules referred to herein
are attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Disclosure of a

counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature
