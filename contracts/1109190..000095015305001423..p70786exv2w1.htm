If any Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect such shareholders dissenters rights under Florida Law or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically be converted into the right to receive the consideration referred to in Section 2.6, pursuant to the exchange procedures set forth in Section 2.9. The Company shall give Buyer (a) prompt notice of any demand for payment of the fair value of any Shares or any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to Florida Law and received by the Company relating to any shareholders dissenters rights, and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment under Florida Law.

If the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer are unable to resolve all disagreements within thirty (30) days of receipt by Buyer of a written notice of disagreement, (or such longer period as may be agreed by Buyer and the Shareholder Representatives), then, within ten (10) days thereafter, the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer shall appoint Grant Thornton, LLC for purposes of resolving any such disagreements (or, if Grant Thornton, LLC shall not be able to serve, the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer shall jointly select a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm that is not the independent auditor of any of Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to resolve such disagreements).

In submitting a dispute to the Arbitrator, each of the parties shall concurrently furnish, at its own respective expense, to the Arbitrator and the other party such documents and information as the Arbitrator may request. Each party may also furnish to the Arbitrator such other information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and information being concurrently given to the other party. Neither party shall have or conduct any communication, either written or oral, with the Arbitrator without the other party either being present or receiving a concurrent copy of any written communication. The Arbitrator may conduct a conference concerning the objections and disagreements between the Shareholder Representatives and Buyer, at which conference each party shall have the right to (i) present its documents, materials and other evidence (previously provided to the Arbitrator and the other party), and (ii) have present its advisors, accountants, counsel and other representatives. The Arbitrator shall resolve each item of disagreement based solely on the presentations and supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant to any independent review ( _provided_ , _however_ , the Arbitrator shall be permitted to conduct any necessary independent research of facts or determining proper application of GAAP or the terms of this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of the objections and disagreement between the parties). As promptly as practicable, the Arbitrator shall issue a detailed written report that sets forth the resolution of all items in dispute and that contains a final Earnout Amount Statement according to the dispute(s) noticed. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties (the date on which the Earnout Amount Statement is accepted or finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.13 is referred to as the " _ _Earnout Determination Date__ "). The Arbitrator may choose to circulate a preliminary report for the comment of the parties. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator incurred in connection with the determination of the disputed    ##### 

  

    

items by the Arbitrator shall be borne by the parties in inverse proportion to
that percentage of the aggregate amounts disputed pursuant to this Section
2.13 are awarded to the parties by the Arbitrator in its written report. The
Buyer and the Shareholder Representatives shall, and Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cooperate fully with the Arbitrator and respond on
a timely basis to all requests for information or access to documents or
personnel made by the Arbitrator or by other parties hereto, all with the
intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all disputes relating to the
Earnout Amount Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable.   

 (c) Within ten (10) days following the Earnout Determination Date, (i) if the Revenue Amount exceeds the First Target Amount, Buyer shall make the First Target Earnout Payment, and (ii) if the Revenue Amount exceeds the Second Target Amount, in addition to the First Target Earnout Payment, Buyer shall make the Second Target Earnout Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (x) Buyer shall not have any obligation to make any payments under this Section 2.13(c) if the Revenue Amount is less than or equal to the First Target Amount; (y) the First Target Earnout Payment shall not exceed $50,000,000; and (z) the Second Target Earnout Payment shall not exceed $8,000,000.  

To illustrate the effects of this Section 2.13(c): (i) if the Revenue Amount
is less than or equal to $102,100,000, Buyer would not make any payment under
this Section 2.13; (ii) if the Revenue Amount is $106,000,000, Buyer would
only be required to make the First Target Earnout Payment and such payment
would be in an amount equal to $22,159,090 (this equation is expressed
numerically as follows: $22,159,090 = $50,000,000 x ($106,000,000 
$102,100,000 ( _i.e_., the First Target Amount)) ¸ $8,800,000); (iii) if the
Revenue Amount is equal to $110,900,000, Buyer would only be required to make
the First Target Earnout Payment and such payment would be in an amount equal
to $50,000,000 (this equation is expressed numerically as follows:
$50,000,000 = $50,000,000 x ($110,900,000  $102,100,000 ( _i.e._ , the First
Target Amount)) ¸ $8,800,000); and (iv) if the Revenue Amount is equal to
$118,900,000, Buyer would be required to make (x) the First Target Earnout
Payment in an amount equal to $50,000,000 (because the First Target Earnout
Payment is capped at $50,000,000) (this equation is expressed numerically as
follows: $50,000,000 = $50,000,000 x ($110,900,000 (the maximum Revenue
Amount for purposes of calculating the First Target Earnout Payment) 
$102,100,000 ( _i.e._ , the First Target Amount)) ¸ $8,800,000), and (y) the
Second Target Earnout Payment in an amount equal to $8,000,000 (this equation
is expressed numerically as follows: $8,000,000 = $118,900,000  $110,900,000
( _i.e._ , the Second Target Amount)).    

 (d) Within ten (10) days following the Earnout Determination Date, if there is any Runoff Revenue, Buyer shall make the Runoff Earnout Payment.   

 (e) In order to ensure that the Company is afforded the full opportunity to receive the payments provided for in Sections 2.13(c) and (d), (i) Buyer shall provide to the Company and the Company shall expend a commercially reasonable amount of resources, qualified personnel and support to allow the Company to have a reasonable opportunity to achieve the revenue targets required to earn the Earn Out Payments pursuant to Section 2.13(c) and (d), and (ii) Buyer shall not take, and shall not cause the Company to take, directly or indirectly, any action that would circumvent the purpose or intent of Section 2.13. The parties hereto agree that neither Buyer nor the Company owes any fiduciary duty or express or implied duty to the Former Shareholders, such as an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, but    ##### 

  

    

instead the parties intend the express provisions of this Agreement (including
without limitation this Section 2.13 hereof) to govern their contractual
relationship.   

 (f) Any payments made by Buyer pursuant to Sections 2.13(c) or (d) hereof shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Shareholder Representatives and such amounts shall be distributed by the Shareholder Representatives to persons who were holders of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time pro rata in accordance with their rights under the terms of this Agreement and the existing terms of their securities as consented to by Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   

 Section 2.14 Taking of Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in their respective names to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary or desirable action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

Buyer shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability set forth in the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.6(a), during the period commencing from the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless each DandO Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any DandO Indemnified Party delivers to Buyer a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 5.6(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Buyer will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) any counsel retained by the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to the defense thereof for any period after the Effective Time must be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and (iii) after the Effective Time, Buyer will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received; _provided_ that in the event of a final nonappealable judicial determination that any DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, any amounts advanced on his or her behalf shall be remitted to the Surviving Corporation); _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation, nor any DandO Indemnified Party, will be liable for any settlement effected without its, his or her express written consent. The DandO Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect to any single action unless counsel for any DandO Indemnified Party determines in good faith that, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict exists or is reasonably likely to arise on any material issue between the positions of any two or more DandO Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 5.6 unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all DandO Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.   

 (c) During the period commencing from the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer shall maintain in effect the current level and scope of directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Buyer); _provided, however,_ that Buyer shall have the right to substitute such current insurance policy with a policy of at least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions that are at least as beneficial to the beneficiaries of the Companys current insurance policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in lieu of maintaining the Companys current insurance policy or obtaining a substitute insurance policy, Buyer shall have the right to obtain a "tail" policy on substantially the same terms and conditions as the current insurance policy with respect to claims arising out of acts or conduct occurring on or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) in connection with    ##### 

  

    

maintaining such current insurance policy, obtaining any substitute insurance
policy or obtaining any "tail" policy, Buyer shall not in any circumstance be
required to expend in any one year any amounts in excess of 150% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for its current insurance
policy; _provided_ that Buyer shall be obligated to maintain or obtain an
insurance policy or a "tail" policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding such amount.   

 (d) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally agree to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the DandO Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.6.   

 (e) This Section 5.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the DandO Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation.   

 Section 5.7 FIRPTA Certificate. The Company shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing a duly executed and acknowledged certificate, in form and substance acceptable to Buyer and in compliance with the Code and Treasury regulations, certifying such facts as to establish that the sale of the Shares is exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.   

 Section 5.8 Other Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the satisfaction of the requirements of _Schedule 5.8_.

 Section 5.9 Other Consents. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain any necessary consents, waivers or novations so that the agreements set forth on  _Schedule 5.9_ remain in full force and effect following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make any payments to any person (or agree to make any such payments) in order to obtain any such consents, waivers or novations (other than any payments contemplated by such agreements, as applicable, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement).   

 Section 5.10 Amendment to Certain Agreement. The Company shall take all action necessary so that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company and E.W. Blanch Co., Inc. (" _ _EWB__ ") shall have amended or terminated that certain Sales Representative Agreement between EWB and the Company, dated as of December 2, 1997, so that, following the Effective Time, EWB shall no longer have the right to nominate any directors to the Companys board of directors.

No Losses in respect of a claim based on a Buyer Indemnification Event shall be included in determining whether the Deductible has been reached unless an Indemnification Notice seeking indemnification for such Losses has been given by Buyer Indemnified Parties to the Shareholder Representatives in accordance with this Article VII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Deductible shall not be applicable to the (x)    ##### 

  

    

Buyer Indemnification Events described in Section 7.3(a)(ii) (if and only if
such events result from the voluntary actions or omissions of the Company)

Claims arising from any Limited Indemnification Events that involve Losses of less than $50,000 (the " _ _Threshold Amount__ ") shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII and shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible and any such claims (or series of related claims) that involve Losses equal to or greater than the Threshold Amount shall be counted toward the satisfaction of Deductible and, once the Deductible has been satisfied, shall be entitled to indemnification as set forth in this Article VII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) the omission of items involving amounts less than or equal to the Threshold Amount from the Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of Article III of this Agreement by the Company, and (B) Losses arising from or related to any of the Unlimited Indemnification Events shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII regardless of the amount of such Losses.   

 Section 7.7 Procedure.   

 (a) In the event that a Buyer Indemnified Party (an " _ _Indemnified Party__ ") shall incur or suffer any Losses in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII from any other Party or Parties (each, an " _ _Indemnifying Party__ "), the Indemnified Party shall submit an Indemnification Notice stating the nature and basis of such claim. The Indemnification Notice shall set forth: (i) the specific representation, warranty or covenant alleged to have been breached by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach of such    ##### 

  

    

representation, warranty or covenant; and (iii) a reasonably detailed
description of, and a reasonable estimate of the total amount of, the Losses
actually incurred or expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party as a
direct result of such alleged breach. In the case of Losses arising by reason
of any third-party claim, the Indemnification Notice shall be given within
thirty (30) days of the filing or other written assertion of any such claim
against the Indemnified Party, but the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnification Notice within such time period shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have
to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced thereby.   

 (b) From the Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall deliver a copy of any Indemnification Notice delivered to the Shareholder Representatives to the Escrow Agent contemporaneously with the delivery of such Indemnification Notice to the Shareholder Representatives.   

 (c) The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party on request all information and documentation in the Indemnified Partys possession (A) that is not privileged and is reasonably necessary to the defense of the claim for indemnification and (B) that is critical (whether or not privileged) to support and verify any Losses which the Indemnified Party believes give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to all books, records and personnel in the possession or under the control of the Indemnified Party which would have bearing on such claim.   

 (d) In the case of third-party claims with respect to which an Indemnification Notice is given, the Indemnifying Party shall have the option to (A) conduct any proceedings or negotiations in connection therewith, (B) take all other steps to settle or defend any such claim and (C) employ counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choosing to contest any such claim in the name of the Indemnified Party or otherwise; _provided_ , that unless a settlement of a claim contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party, no settlement shall be effected without the advance written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense and by its own counsel in any proceedings relating to any third-party claim, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate with counsel of its own choice at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if representation of both parties by the same counsel presents a conflict of interest or is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct. The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Indemnification Notice, notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to assume the defense of any such claim. Until the Indemnified Party has received notice of the Indemnifying Partys election whether to defend any such claim, the Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to defend (but may not settle) such claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall elect to assume the defense of any such claim, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any documents and materials in its possession or control that may be necessary to the defense of such claim, and the Indemnified Party shall execute such documents and take such other actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise or adjustment relating to, such matter. If the Indemnifying Party shall decline to assume the defense of any such claim, or shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Indemnification Notice of the Indemnifying    ##### 

  

    

Partys election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall proceed
diligently to defend such claim. The expenses of all proceedings, in respect
of any such claims (other than those incurred by the Indemnified Party which
are referred to in the second sentence of this subparagraph (iii)) shall be
borne by the Indemnifying Party but only if the Indemnifying Party is
responsible pursuant hereto to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of
such claim and, if applicable, only to the extent required by this Article
VII. Regardless of which party shall assume the defense of the claim, the
parties agree to cooperate fully with one another in
connection therewith.   

 Section 7.8 No Limitation on Right to Contest. Nothing in this Article VII shall be construed as a limitation on the Indemnifying Partys right to contest in good faith whether the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII with respect to a particular claim.   

 Section 7.9 Sole Remedy. Except with respect to acts of fraud or willful misconduct, the indemnification provided for in this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for all matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) the Cap, the Deductible and the Threshold shall not be applicable to the amounts recoverable by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in connection with Unlimited Indemnification Events (except that the Cap shall be applicable to the Buyer Indemnification Events described in Section 7.3(a)(vi)), and (B) if Losses related to any Unlimited Indemnification Events (other than the Buyer Indemnification Events described in Section 7.3(a)(vi)) exceed the outstanding balance of the Escrow Fund on any particular date (or if the Escrow Fund has terminated on the first anniversary of the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), the Former Shareholders, Option Holders and Warrant Holders, as applicable, shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5(b), on a pro rata basis, directly indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for such Losses; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such Former Shareholder, Option Holder or Warrant Holder shall have an obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to the foregoing for any Losses in excess of the amounts received by such person in connection with this Agreement.   

 Section 7.10 Availability of Insurance; Subrogation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery from their insurance providers with respect to any Losses for which indemnity may be sought under this Article VII and for which insurance may be available, and (b) all Losses shall be net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received by or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be permitted to receive indemnification for Losses out of the Escrow Fund (if applicable) regardless of whether the Buyer Indemnified Parties may be entitled to recover such Losses from their insurance providers, although upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any third-parties (including insurance providers) with    ##### 

  

    

respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying
Party.   

 Section 7.11 Termination of Indemnification. The indemnification provided for in connection with the Limited Indemnification Events shall terminate on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any party thereafter) and the indemnification provided for in connection with the Unlimited Indemnification Events (except with respect to the Buyer Indemnification Events described in Section 7.3(a)(ii)) shall survive until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any exclusions thereof), except that a partys right to indemnification hereunder shall continue as to any Losses of which such party has validly given an Indemnification Notice in accordance with the requirements of this Article VII on or prior to such one-year anniversary or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, as the case may be, and the associated indemnity obligations shall continue solely with respect to the specific matters in such Indemnification Notice until the liability shall have been determined pursuant to this Article VII.

 Section 8.2 Actions of the Shareholder Representatives.

Buyer and Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by the Shareholder Representatives and any acts done by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representatives.

 (b) The Shareholder Representatives may, from time to time, withdraw amounts from the Shareholder Representatives Expense Account for the payment of Shareholder Representatives Expenses. Upon the date that the Shareholder Representatives determine    #####

are no longer necessary to be maintained for the performance of the
obligations of the Shareholder Representatives, and if there shall then be
any amount on deposit in the Shareholder Representative Expense Account, the
Shareholder Representatives shall promptly distribute such amount based upon
a pro rata distribution of amounts released from the Shareholder
Representatives Expenses Fund to all former holders of Common Stock based on
their holdings thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

ARTICLE IX

 Section 10.7 Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.   

 Section 10.8 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and independent public accountants; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be responsible only for fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and other advisors or service providers incurred by the Company or its shareholders in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in an amount up to $250,000 (it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, any fees, costs, expenses or disbursements of accountants for the Company in connection with the audit of the Companys financial statements as of, and for the periods ended, December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, or in connection with the preparation of the Companys financial statements as of, and for the period ended, March 31, 2005, shall be considered to be in the ordinary course of business and not "in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby").   

 Section 10.9 Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.   

 Section 10.10 Execution in Counterparts; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the Shareholder Representatives, the Company, Buyer and the Merger Sub.

 Section 10.11 Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    #####
