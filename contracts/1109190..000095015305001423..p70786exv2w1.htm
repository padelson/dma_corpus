Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer will indemnify and
hold harmless each D&#038;O Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (i)&nbsp;any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such D&#038;O Indemnified Party&#146;s capacity as a director, officer or employee of
the Company or (ii)&nbsp;any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; <I>provided, however</I>, that
if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any D&#038;O Indemnified Party
delivers to Buyer a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section&nbsp;5.6(b),
then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i)&nbsp;Buyer will have the right to control the defense
thereof after the Effective Time, (ii)&nbsp;any counsel retained by the D&#038;O Indemnified Parties with
respect to the defense thereof for any period after the Effective Time must be reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, and (iii)&nbsp;after the Effective Time, Buyer will pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received; <I>provided </I>that in the
event of a final nonappealable judicial determination that any D&#038;O Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder, any amounts advanced on his or her behalf shall be remitted
to the Surviving Corporation); <I>provided</I>, <I>further</I>, that neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation,
nor any D&#038;O Indemnified Party, will be liable for any settlement effected without its, his or her
express written consent. The D&#038;O Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in
addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect to any single action unless counsel for
any D&#038;O Indemnified Party determines in good faith that, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict exists or is reasonably likely to arise on any material issue between the
positions of any two or more D&#038;O Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section&nbsp;5.6(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer shall not settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under
this Section&nbsp;5.6 unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all D&#038;O Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall elect to assume the defense of any such claim, the

possession or control that may be necessary to the defense of such claim, and the Indemnified Party
