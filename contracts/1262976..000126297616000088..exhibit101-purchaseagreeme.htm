(a) Estimated Purchase Price. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing, Sellers' Representative shall (or shall cause the Company to)
deliver to Buyer a certificate (the "Closing Date Statement") setting forth a
good faith calculation of the Purchase Price based upon (i) the actual

(including, with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, the terms of Exhibit A, and with respect to the calculation of
the Net Working Capital Adjustment, the terms of Exhibit B) (such calculation
of the Purchase Price, the "Estimated Purchase Price").

(b) Determination of Final Purchase Price.

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare (and deliver to Sellers' Representative) a
certificate setting forth Buyer's good faith proposed calculation of the
Purchase Price, together with Buyer's good faith proposed calculations of the

Closing Date Funded Indebtedness and Seller Expenses, in each case, including
the components thereof and in a manner consistent with the definitions thereof
(including, with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, the terms of Exhibit A, and with respect to the calculation of
the Net Working Capital Adjustment, the terms of Exhibit B) (which
calculations shall collectively be referred to herein from time to time as the
"Proposed Closing Date Calculations"). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, if Buyer fails to timely deliver any of the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations, then, at the election of Sellers'
Representative in its sole discretion, Sellers' Representative may retain a
nationally or regionally recognized independent accounting firm to provide an
audit of the Group Companies' books, review the calculation of the Estimated
Purchase Price and make any adjustments necessary thereto consistent with the
provisions of this Section 2.4(b), the determination of such accounting firm
being conclusive and binding on the Parties; provided, however, that Sellers
reserve any and all rights granted to it in this Agreement. In connection with
the foregoing, each Group Company shall, and shall cause each other Group
Company to, make its financial records available to such accounting firm in
connection with its services and all fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be paid by Buyer. Notwithstanding Sellers' right to dispute the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(ii), if (A) the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations provide that the Purchase Price is greater than the
Estimated Purchase Price, then within three (3) Business Days after the date
Buyer delivers to Sellers' Representative the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute
all funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account to Sellers' Representative, or (B)
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations provide that the Estimated Purchase
Price is greater than the Purchase Price, then within three (3) Business Days
after the date Buyer delivers to Sellers' Representative the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent



EAST\\\134549672.25 18

* * *





to distribute to Sellers' Representative an amount equal to (I) the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, minus (II) the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price
and the Purchase Price (as calculated in the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations).

(ii) If Sellers' Representative does not give written notice of any dispute (a
"Purchase Price Dispute Notice") to Buyer within thirty (30) days of timely
receiving the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Parties each agree that
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final
Net Working Capital Adjustment, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, Seller Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for all
purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment);
provided, however, that in the event that Sellers' Representative reasonably
requests additional materials from Buyer in order to evaluate the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations and Buyer does not provide such materials within
five (5) days of Holdings Seller's request thereof (or such shorter period as
may remain in such thirty (30) day period), such thirty (30) day period shall
be extended by one (1) day for each additional day required for Buyer to fully
respond to such request. If Sellers' Representative delivers a Purchase Price
Dispute Notice to Buyer within such 30-day period, Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the
dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date Buyer receives the
applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Sellers' Representative and all
such discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and
Sellers' Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state Law or rule. If Sellers'
Representative and Buyer do not agree upon a final resolution with respect to
any disputed items contained in such Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such
30-day period, then Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall engage, and such
remaining items in dispute shall be submitted immediately to, a nationally or
regionally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Sellers' Representative. If Buyer and Sellers' Representative are unable to
agree on the choice of such accounting firm within ten (10) Business Days
after the expiration of the aforementioned 30-day period, then Buyer and
Sellers' Representative shall select a nationally or regionally recognized
accounting firm by lot (after excluding their respective regularly used
accounting firms). The accounting firm so agreed to or selected (the
"Accounting Firm") shall be required to render a determination of the
applicable dispute within thirty (30) days after referral of the matter to
such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The sole task of the
Accounting Firm shall be to resolve the disputed items by setting forth a
value, for each disputed item, which value shall not be in excess of, nor less
than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, set forth in the Purchase
Price Dispute Notice or the Proposed Closing Date Calculations. Neither Buyer
nor the Sellers' Representative shall have any ex parte conversations or
meetings with the Accounting Firm without the prior consent of the other
Party. Such determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder (including the
determination of the Actual Adjustment). The Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be revised, if necessary, as appropriate to reflect the
resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this Section 2.4(b)(ii) and,
as so revised, such Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set
forth the final Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date
Funded Indebtedness, Seller Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for all
purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment). The
terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed
upon between Seller and Buyer, and any associated engagement fees shall
initially be borne 50%



EAST\\\134549672.25 19

* * *





by Sellers' Representative and 50% by Buyer; provided that such fees shall
ultimately be borne by Buyer on the one hand and Sellers, on the other hand,
in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of the disputed items that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as determined by the Accounting
Firm) bears to the total amount of the dispute items submitted to the
Accounting Firm.

(iii) The Company and the Blocker shall, and shall cause each other Group
Company to, make its financial records and personnel available to Sellers'
Representative, its accountants and other representatives and the Accounting
Firm at reasonable times during the review by Sellers' Representative and the
Accounting Firm of, and the resolution of any objections with respect to, the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations.

(c) Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price.

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then (A) Buyer shall pay
(or shall cause to be paid) to Sellers' Representative an amount in cash equal
to such positive amount and (B) all funds remaining in the Adjustment Escrow
Account shall be released to Sellers' Representative. Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall take all actions required to cause the Escrow Agent to
make all disbursements, and Buyer shall make (or cause to be made) all
payments, required pursuant to this Section 2.4(c)(i), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (to an account designated by Sellers'
Representative to Buyer) within three (3) Business Days after the date on
which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(b)
above.

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then Buyer shall be
entitled to receive a cash disbursement from the Adjustment Escrow Amount
equal to such negative amount, and, if such disbursement is insufficient to
satisfy the entire amount of the Actual Adjustment, then Buyer, at its option,
may collect the Actual Adjustment from the Indemnity Escrow Amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, after all
disbursements required to be made to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.4(c)(ii)
have been made by the Escrow Agent, if any funds remain in the Adjustment
Escrow Account, such remaining funds shall be disbursed to Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). The Parties shall take all actions
required to cause the Escrow Agent to make all disbursements required pursuant
to this Section 2.4(c)(ii) by wire transfer of immediately available funds (to
the applicable accounts designated by Buyer and Sellers' Representative, as
applicable) within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the
Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(b).

(d) Accounting Procedures. The Closing Date Statement, the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations and any estimates, determinations and calculations contained
therein shall be prepared and calculated for the Group Companies, on a
consolidated basis (solely in the case of Subsidiaries of the Company) and
using the same accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and
methods (with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions
and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the Group
Companies in the preparation of the Example Statement of Net Working Capital
and the Example Statement of Funded Indebtedness, provided, that such
statements, estimates, calculations and determinations: (i) shall not include
any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of
the Transactions, (ii) shall be based on facts and circumstances as they exist
prior to the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or
event occurring on or after the Closing, (iii) shall



EAST\\\134549672.25 20

* * *





follow the defined terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms
are consistent with GAAP, and (iv) shall be prepared consistent with the
methods used in preparing the Financial Statements.

Section 2.5 Purchase Price Allocation. Each Seller, the Company, and the Buyer
agree to allocate the Purchase Price and any other relevant amounts
(including, if applicable, any liabilities treated as assumed for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) between the Blocker Stock and the Purchased Units and, as
applicable, among the assets of the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company
treated as a "disregarded entity" for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
accordance with Schedule 2.5 (the "Tax Allocation Statement") for U.S. federal
and applicable state and local income Tax purposes, including, to the extent
applicable, Sections 704(c), 755 and 1060 of the Code; provided that, such
Schedule shall be updated by the Sellers' Representative with Buyer's consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in
good faith no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date in a
manner consistent with the Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Date
Statement and the valuation assumptions and methodologies reflected in
Schedule 2.5. The Sellers' Representative shall, with Buyer's consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), adjust
the Tax Allocation Statement from time to time in a manner consistent with the
principles of Schedule 2.5 to take into account any amounts treated as
adjustments to purchase price for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Promptly
following the date hereof, the Sellers' Representative shall engage KPMG LLP
to prepare a third party valuation with respect to (i) "Class V assets - stock
of NPPHL (Ireland subsidiary)," (ii) "Class V assets - stock of Pluma (Mexico
subsidiary)" and (iii) "Class VI assets (section 197 intangibles other than
goodwill and going concern value)" (the "KPMG Valuation"). Buyer agrees that
up to a maximum of $75,000 of the cost of the KPMG Valuation ("KPMG Costs")
shall be treated as Cash and Cash Equivalents for purposes of calculating the
Purchase Price. Promptly following receipt of the KPMG Valuation, the Sellers'
Representative shall provide a copy thereof to Buyer. Thereafter, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith concerning any potential adjustments to the Tax
Allocation Statement related to the three asset classes described above. In
the event the Parties are unable to agree upon one or more adjustments to the
Tax Allocation Statement related to the three assets classes described above
prior to the Closing Date (or such later date as may be mutually agreed upon
by the Parties), then the amount allocated to any such asset class that
remains in dispute as of such time shall be the amount reflected in the Tax
Allocation Statement as of the date hereof. No Party or Affiliate of any Party
shall take, or permit any Affiliate to take, any position for any Tax purpose
(whether in connection with audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the final Tax Allocation Statement, except as required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law).

Section 2.6 Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Escrow Agent to deduct and withhold, from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement any withholding Taxes or other amounts required
under the Code or any applicable Tax Law to be deducted and withheld;
provided, that before withholding from a payment made to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the payment of such amount, provide the
Sellers with written notice of its intent to deduct and withhold, (ii)
cooperate in good faith with Sellers to reduce or eliminate the deduction



EAST\\\134549672.25 21

* * *





or withholding of such amount, and (iii) shall provide Sellers a reasonable
opportunity to provide forms or other documentation that would exempt such
amounts from withholding. To the extent that any such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

would be required to be disclosed under Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act, except liabilities or obligations that
(i) are disclosed on Schedule 3.4(c), (ii) were incurred since the Latest

(iv) are not material to the Group Companies, and (v) relate to a subject
matter specifically addressed by other representations and warranties

representations and warranties, such as knowledge, materiality and Company
Material Adverse Effect qualifications and dollar thresholds.

violate or result in any breach of any material provision of any Group
Company's Governing Documents, (ii) except as set forth on Schedule 3.5,
result in a violation or breach of, or cause acceleration, or constitute (with

terms, conditions or provisions of any Material Contract or any Material
Lease, (iii) violate any Order or Law applicable to any Group Company or any

which is material to any Group Company. The Company has given Buyer access to
a true and correct copy of each Material Contract.

Section 3.7 Absence of Changes. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7 and as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2015, there has
not been any event or development that could, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
each Group Company has conducted its business in the ordinary course, no Group
Company has taken any action or omitted to take any action which, if taken or
omitted to be taken after the date of this Agreement, would require the
consent of Buyer in accordance with Section 6.1(b), and (d) no Group Company

the Transactions) might affect one or more of the Group Companies' customer or
supplier relationships, and that such effects do not and will not constitute a

her capacity as such, at Law or in equity or before any Governmental Entity,
and (ii) no Group Company has been subject to any outstanding Order (at Law or
in equity), writ, injunction or decree (if finally determined pursuant to a
final, non-appealable judgment in a manner adverse to the Group Companies); in
each case of (i) and (ii) above, that would have an adverse effect which is
material to any Group Company.

Section 3.9 Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits.

(a) The business of the Group Companies is and has been for the past three (3)
years operated in compliance, and to the Company's knowledge, each of the
officers, directors and executive employees of such Persons are in compliance
and have complied, in each case, in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, rules, regulations, codes, ordinances and Orders of all Governmental

Permits issued to any Group Company (the "Material Permits"). The Group

necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as presently
conducted. The Group Companies are in compliance, in all material respects,
with all such Material Permits and all such Material Permits are in full force

Company's knowledge, no event has occurred which could reasonably be expected
to result in the modification, non-renewal, suspension, cancellation or
termination of any such Permit. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
Company's knowledge, threatened by any Governmental Entity with respect to (a)
any alleged failure by any Group Company or any of their respective personnel
to have any Permit required in connection with the operation of their
respective businesses or (b) any revocation, cancellation, rescission,
modification, termination or refusal to renew in the ordinary course, any of
the Material Permits.

employees outside the United States is a defined benefit pension plan.

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan has been established, maintained, operated,
funded and administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with
the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Laws
in all material respects. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be

determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service or is in the form of a

the tax-qualified status of such plan.

ERISA.

to Buyer copies, to the extent applicable, of (i) the plan and trust documents

Proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened with respect to any

connection with any Employee Benefit Plan, and, to the Company's knowledge,
there is no reasonable basis for any such litigation or Proceeding. All

have been accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable Employee

(k) neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will require any material notice to or consent, clearance or

of the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

This Section 3.11 contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company with respect to environmental matters, including any
matters arising under Environmental Laws or relating to Hazardous Substances.

Section 3.12 Intellectual Property.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12, the Group Companies own, license or
otherwise have the right to use all Intellectual Property Rights necessary for
or material to the conduct of the business of the Group Companies as currently
conducted (collectively, the "Group Company IP Rights"); provided that the
preceding sentence shall not be deemed a representation or warranty with
respect to whether the conduct of the business of the Group Companies
infringes the Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person, which is the
subject of the last sentence of this Section 3.12(a). Schedule 3.12 sets forth
a list of (i) patented and registered Group Company IP Rights owned by any
Group Company, and (ii) patent applications and applications for the
registration of Group Company IP Rights owned by any Group Company. The
registered, patented or pending applications for any Group Company IP Rights
owned by the Group Companies are subsisting and, to the Company's knowledge,
valid and enforceable. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12, there is not
pending or threatened in writing against any Group Company any action by any
third party contesting the validity, enforceability use or ownership of any
Group Company IP Right owned by any Group Company. The conduct of the business
of the Group Companies as currently conducted does not infringe or
misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party



EAST\\\134549672.25 33

* * *





(provided that the foregoing representation is qualified as to the Company's
knowledge solely with respect to the infringement or misappropriation of
patents or patent rights), and, to the Company's knowledge, no third party is
infringing or misappropriating any material Group Company IP Rights owned by
any Group Company.

(b) Except as would not have an adverse effect which is material to the Group
Companies, taken as a whole, the computer systems, including software, used by
the Group Companies in the conduct of their respective businesses
(collectively, the "Group Company Systems") are sufficient for the needs of
the Group Companies' respective businesses as they are currently conducted. In
the last twelve (12) months, there has not been any material failure with
respect to any of the Group Company Systems that has not been remedied. The
Group Companies have in place commercially reasonable measures, consistent in
all material respects with customary industry practices, to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and security of the Group Company Systems (and all
information and transactions stored or contained therein) against any
unauthorized use, access or corruption. The Group Companies have implemented
commercially reasonable data backup and data storage procedures, as well as a
commercially reasonable business continuity plan, in each case consistent in
all material respects with customary industry practices in the geographies in
which such Person operates. To the Company's knowledge, except as set forth in
Schedule 3.12, none of the Group Companies use any open source software or
similar software in a manner that would require disclosure or licensing of any
material Intellectual Property Rights, including source code, owned by such
Group Company.

(c) All Intellectual Property Rights created by any employee, agent,
independent contractor or other Person for any Group Companies, are wholly
owned by such Group Company and have been assigned to such Group Company

Rights, which is in full force and effect and is valid and, to the Company's
knowledge, binding on each other party thereto (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting
generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and subject to general
principles of equity). No present or former employee, officer or director of
any Group Company, any of its agents or outside contractors, holds any right,
title or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in or to any
Intellectual Property rights that any Group Company purports to own. The Group
Companies (including any of their predecessors in interest) have written
agreements with all of their past and present employees requiring such
employees to assign all patents, patent applications, inventions and other
Intellectual Property Rights to such Group Company and waive all moral rights,
as necessary to protect such Group Company's ownership interest in the
Intellectual Property Rights, and all such agreements are valid and
enforceable.

(d) The Group Companies use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent in all
material respects with customary industry practices, to register and
reasonably maintain and protect each item of Intellectual Property Rights
owned by such Person which is material to their businesses. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.5, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the Transactions, will not result
in the forfeiture, cancellation, termination or other material impairment of,
or give rise to any right of any Person to cancel, terminate or otherwise
impair the right of the Group Companies to own or use or otherwise exercise



EAST\\\134549672.25 34

any other rights that the Group Companies currently have with respect to any
Group Company IP Rights.

required by applicable Law. Except as may be prohibited by applicable Law and
as set forth on Schedule 3.6(a)(i), the engagement of any temporary employees

individual agreement or offer letter that materially deviates therefrom. None
of the employees listed on Schedule 3.13(a)(i) who are officers or the Chief
Executive Officer's direct reports have terminated their employment nor have
threatened in writing to terminate such employment, nor have any of the Group
Companies given notice of termination to any such employee. The Group
Companies have properly classified their employees in the U.S. as exempt or
non-exempt for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state and local
wage and hour Laws, and are otherwise in compliance in all material respects
with such Laws. The Group Companies are, and for the last three years have
been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws

employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, occupational safety
and health, workers' compensation, worker classification (including

and independent contractors), immigration, affirmative action, wages and hours
(including without limitation working time, overtime and minimum wage), use of
temporary employees, equal pay, payroll processing and withholdings,
termination of employment and unfair dismissal. All Persons, including

independent contractors have reasonably satisfied the requirements of
applicable Law to be so classified and have been engaged in accordance with
applicable Law.

(b) No Group Company is presently, or has been in the past three (3) years,
party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract
with a labor union, works council, or any other employee representative with
respect to its employees, and no such Contract



EAST\\\134549672.25 35

* * *





is being negotiated by any of the Group Companies, nor is there any duty on
the part of any of the Group Companies to bargain with any labor organization
or representative. There are no labor organizations representing, purporting
to represent or, to the Company's knowledge, seeking to represent any current
employees of any of the Group Companies. There is no labor strike, work
stoppage, or other concerted interference with normal operations or similarly
material labor dispute pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
against any Group Company. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Company's
knowledge, no union organization campaign is in progress with respect to any
employees of any Group Company and no unfair labor practice charge or
complaint has been served on any Group Company or is threatened. No Group
Company has engaged in any "plant closing," or "mass layoff" since January 1,
2016, as defined in the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of
1988, as amended (to the extent applicable) or any similar plant closing or
mass layoff Laws ("WARN Act") affecting any site of employment of any of the
Group Companies or one or more facilities or operating units within any site
of employment or facility of the Group Companies. Schedule 3.13(b) lists all
employees of the Group Companies whose employment was terminated by the
Company Group (other than for cause) during the ninety (90)-day period ending
on the date hereof.

(c) The Group Companies (i) are not delinquent in any payments to any of its
employees, any third-party staffing agency or the equivalent for purposes of
paying temporary employees, consultants or independent contractors for any
wages, salaries, overtime, commissions, bonuses, fees or other compensation
due and payable with respect to any services performed for any of the Group
Companies or amounts required to be reimbursed to such Person; or (ii) have
made any required payments to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Entity with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, social security or similar obligations for
any employees of the Group Companies (other than routine payments to be made
in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice). None of
the employment policies or practices of any of the Group Companies are
currently being audited or investigated by any Governmental Entity. The Group
Companies have delivered to Buyer accurate and complete copies of all employee
manuals and handbooks and policy statements relating to the employment of
their employees.

(d) No litigation or governmental administrative Proceeding, audit or other
Proceeding (excluding any ordinary-course workers compensation, unemployment
or similar Proceeding) is pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
between any Group Company, on the one hand, and any current or former
employee, temporary employee, independent contractor or consultant of any
Group Company or any third party or Governmental Entity acting on their
behalf, on the other hand, and, to the Company's knowledge, there is no
reasonable basis for any such litigation or Proceeding that would have an
adverse effect which is material to any Group Company. No Group Company is
bound by any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Entity
relating to any current or former employee, temporary employee, independent
contractor or consultant.

Section 3.14 Insurance. Schedule 3.14(a) contains a complete and correct list

Transactions based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of any Group
Company.

Section 3.17 Real and Personal Property.

(a) Real Property.

(i) Schedule 3.17(a) sets forth (A) a list of all real property owned by any
Group Company (such real property, the "Owned Real Property"), and (B)
(whether as lessee or lessor) a list of all leases or occupancy agreements
(each a "Material Lease") of real property (such real property, the "Leased
Real Property"; and together with the Owned Real Property, the "Company Real
Property") to which any Group Company is a party or by which any of them is
bound, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement, except for any lease or
agreement pursuant to which any Group Company holds or leases Leased Real
Property under which the aggregate annual rental payments do not exceed
$250,000 and the remaining term thereof does not exceed one (1) year. The
Company Real Property comprises all material real property used by the Group
Companies in conduct of their business. To the Company's knowledge, there is
no dispute with any adjoining or neighboring owner or occupier with respect to
the Company's use and occupation of any Company Real Property. With respect to
each parcel of Company Real Property, except as disclosed on Schedule 3.17(a):
(I) within the last twelve (12) months, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice of, and to the Company's knowledge
there is not, any pending or threatened condemnation or eminent domain
Proceedings or their local equivalent affecting or relating to such Company
Real Property; and (II) within the last twelve (12) months, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice from any
Governmental Entity or other Person that the use and occupancy of any of the
Company Real Property, as currently used and occupied, and the conduct of the
business thereon, as currently conducted, violates in any material respect any
deed restrictions, Permitted Liens, applicable Law consisting of building
codes,



EAST\\\134549672.25 39

* * *





zoning, subdivision or other land use or similar Laws or any Permits, licenses
or approvals issued thereunder, and to the Company's knowledge no such
material violations exist. Except for the Permitted Liens, there exist no
Liens affecting the Company Real Property created by, through or under the
Group Companies. To the Company's knowledge, except as otherwise set forth in
Schedule 3.17(a), all buildings, structures, improvements, fixtures, building
systems and equipment, and all components thereof, included in the Company
Real Property are sufficient for the current operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(ii) The applicable Group Companies have good and marketable fee simple title
to all of the Owned Real Property, in each case free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens. No person holds any option or right of first
refusal or first opportunity to acquire any interest in any Owned Real
Property.

(iii) The Company has provided to Buyer true and complete copies of each
Material Lease, including all amendments and supplements thereto. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.17(a), each Material Lease is valid and binding on the
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and subject to
general principles of equity). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17(a), each
of the Group Companies, and, to the Company's knowledge, each of the other
parties thereto, has performed in all material respects all material
obligations required to be performed by it under each Material Lease, there
are no defaults under any Material Lease, and to the Company's knowledge, no
circumstance currently exists which, with notice or the passage of time, or
both, would give rise to a default by any party under any Material Lease or
which would give rise to an entitlement on the part of any landlord under any
Material Lease to terminate such Material Lease. With respect to each Material
Lease, the other party to such lease is not an Affiliate of Sellers. The Group
Companies have not subleased or otherwise granted any Person the right to use
or occupy any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property. The Group Companies
have not collaterally assigned or granted any other security interest in the
Leased Real Property or any interest therein.

(b) Personal Property. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.17(b), as of the date
of this Agreement, the Group Companies collectively own, or hold under valid
leases disclosed on Schedule 3.17(b), all (i) of the properties and assets,
tangible or intangible, currently used by the Group Companies or otherwise
necessary for the conduct of their businesses as currently conducted, and (ii)
assets reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet or acquired after the date
thereof, except as sold or disposed of subsequent to the date thereof in the
ordinary course of business, in each case subject to no Lien except for Liens
identified on Schedule 3.17(b) and Permitted Liens. Such personal property is
reasonably suitable for its intended use, is in good operating condition and
repair (subject to normal wear and tear), and is free from material defects.
This Section 3.17(b) does not relate to intellectual property matters (which
is the subject of Section 3.12)

Company, on the one hand, and any current or former director, manager,
officer, holder of Equity Interests, employee or Affiliates of any Group
Company, on the

no further liability or obligation continuing after such termination with
respect to any Person who is a party to such Contract, loans, leases or other
arrangements. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.18 and to the Company's
knowledge, none of the Group Companies and their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers possesses, directly or indirectly, any financial
interest in, or is a director or officer of, any Person (other than any Group
Company) which is a material client or supplier of any Group Company.
Ownership of securities of a company whose securities are registered under the

Schedule 3.20, since September 30, 2016 to the date hereof, no Key Supplier

materially reducing, its relationship with any Group Company or the supply of

Companies, and to the Company's knowledge, no Key Supplier has any plan or
intention to do any of the foregoing, subject to general and customary price
changes, including, without limitation, product availability, price changes
and economic changes.

implied warranties, and (b) there is no pending or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened recall of any Product. There are no existing nor, to the

that any Product is defective in any material respect or fails to meet any
product or services warranties in any material respect.

each other Group Company to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Buyer



EAST\\\134549672.25 49

* * *





and its authorized representatives during normal business hours reasonable
access to, or copies of, all of the properties, books, records, Contracts,
documents and insurance policies of the Group Companies reasonably requested
(in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business operations of any
Group Company). All of such information and any other information provided by
any Party to any other Party and/or such other Party's representatives shall
be treated as "Confidential Information."

(b) Each Seller acknowledges that, through its, his or her direct or indirect
ownership interest in the Company, such Seller has obtained written and/or
confidential and proprietary information concerning the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that includes, without limitation, (i) any
formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and which gives the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries an actual or potential competitive advantage over
companies operating in the same or similar business who lack knowledge of or
do not use such information, (ii) proprietary technology, operating procedures
and methods of operation, financial statements and other financial
information, trade secrets, market studies and forecasts, competitive
analyses, pricing policies, the substance of agreements with customers,
referral sources and others, marketing and similar arrangements, servicing and
training programs and arrangements, customer and referral provider lists,
other trade secrets, and (iii) any notes, compilations, Excel spread sheets,
data reports, studies, interpretations or other documents embodying
confidential and proprietary information (clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, the
"Confidential Information"). Each Seller acknowledges that furnishing
Confidential Information to third parties would be detrimental to Buyer and
the Company and would place Buyer and the Company at a competitive
disadvantage. During the Pre-Closing Period and from the Closing Date until
the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, each Seller severally agrees that
it, shall not, directly or indirectly, use or disclose any Confidential
Information to any Person or direct or permit any of such Seller's Affiliates
to use or disclose Confidential Information to any Person. The foregoing
restrictions and obligations under this Section 6.2(b) shall not apply to: (A)
any Confidential Information that is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure, directly or indirectly, by a
Seller, (B) any information obtained by a Seller from a third party on a non-
confidential basis, provided that such third party is not known by such Seller
to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other legal or fiduciary
obligation to, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that prohibits
the disclosure of Confidential Information, (C) any information a Seller is
required by Law, legal process or regulation to disclose, provided that if
practicable and permitted by Law or Order, such disclosing Seller shall
provide Buyer and the Company with prompt written notice of any such request
or requirement so that Buyer and the Company may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 6.2(b), provided further that such disclosing Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer and the Company in seeking such a protective order and/or
other appropriate remedy, or (D) any disclosure to a Seller's accountants,
attorneys, advisors, Affiliates, members, partners and direct and indirect
owners provided that such Seller shall advise such Persons of the confidential
nature of such Confidential Information, such Seller shall direct such
recipient to comply with the terms of this Section 6.2(b), and such Seller
shall be responsible for any unauthorized use or disclosure by such Persons of
any such Confidential Information. Each Seller agrees that money damages would
not be a sufficient remedy for any breach (or threatened breach) of this
Section 6.2(b) by a Seller and that Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to



EAST\\\134549672.25 50

* * *





equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, pursuant to
Section 10.14 as a remedy for any such breach (or threatened breach), without
proof of damages, and each Party further agrees to waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Such
remedies shall not be the exclusive remedies for breach of this Section
6.2(b), but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in
equity.

Section 6.3 Efforts to Consummate; Further Assurances.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each Party shall
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
Transactions (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing
conditions set forth in Article 7). Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain consents and other authorizations
of all Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the Transactions. All
governmental filing fees incurred in connection with obtaining such consents
and authorizations, including the HSR Act filing fee, shall be borne by Buyer.
Each Party shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the Transactions promptly (and in any event, within five
(5) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, and Buyer shall make, as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all filings required
under any other antitrust or competition Law for the consummation of the
Transactions; provided that the Company and Sellers shall collaborate with
Buyer in good faith, and provide all information reasonably requested by
Buyer, for the purpose of preparing and submitting such filings. To the extent
available, each such filing, including without limitation the HSR Act filing,
shall request early termination of the review period. The Parties shall
respond as promptly as practicable to any request from a Governmental Entity
for additional information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act
and any other applicable antitrust, competition or similar Law, rule
regulation, Order or decree. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Sellers and
Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period or
comparable period under the HSR Act or similar antitrust or competition Law,
or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
(ii) the Parties shall take all actions that are reasonably necessary or
advisable or as may be reasonably required by any Governmental Entity to
expeditiously consummate the Transactions. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this Section 6.3, obligates Buyer to (A) sell, license or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate or agree to sell, license or otherwise dispose
of, any entities, assets or facilities of any Group Company after the Closing
or any entity, facility or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates, (B) terminate,
amend or assign existing relationships or contractual rights and obligations,
(C) amend, assign or terminate existing licenses or other agreements or enter
into such new licenses or other agreements, or (D) except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, enter into new contractual obligations. Except as
expressly permitted by this Agreement, neither the Company, nor Sellers on
behalf of the Company, shall do or agree to do any of the things listed in (A)
through (D) above except with the express prior written consent of Buyer.

(b) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other Proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection
therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their



EAST\\\134549672.25 51

* * *





reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation or other Proceeding and, if an injunction or other Order is
issued in any such action, suit or other Proceeding, to use their best efforts
to have such injunction or other Order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably
regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) From and after the Closing, each Party, at the request of any other Party,
shall, without further consideration, promptly execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, to such other Party such instruments in addition
to those required by this Agreement, and take all such other actions, as is
reasonably necessary or desirable to implement any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 6.4 Public Announcements. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand, shall consult with one another and seek one another's written
approval before issuing any press release, or otherwise making any public
statements, with respect to Transactions, and shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation and approval; provided that each Party
may make any such announcement which it in good faith believes, based on
advice of counsel, is necessary or advisable in connection with any
requirement of Law or regulation, it being understood and agreed that each
Party shall provide the other Parties with copies of any such announcement in
advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall this Section 6.4 limit disclosure by any Party or
any of its respective Affiliates to any direct or indirect investors in any
such Person, as applicable, or in connection with normal fund raising and
related marketing or informational or reporting activities of such Party or
any such Affiliate.

Section 6.5 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors, officers, and managers of each Group
Company, as provided in such Group Company's Governing Documents or otherwise
in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any matters
occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect and
that the applicable Group Company will perform and discharge such Group
Company's obligations to provide such indemnity and exculpation. The
indemnification and liability limitation or exculpation provisions of the
Group Companies' Governing Documents shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner that would materially
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of the Closing
Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were directors, officers, or
managers of any Group Company, unless such modification is required by
applicable law.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a prepaid, non-
cancellable "tail" policy to the HCC Global/ U.S. Specialty Insurance Company
Policy No. 114MGU16A37031 and the ACE American Insurance Company Excess
Liability Insurance, Policy No. G251245456002 maintained by the Group
Companies or the Sellers with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Closing (including the Transactions), which policies shall be
effective for a period from the Closing Date through and including the six (6)
years after the Closing Date (the "DandO Tail Policy"); provided, that the costs
of such DandO Tail Policy shall be borne by



EAST\\\134549672.25 52

* * *





the Sellers, and shall be treated as a Seller Expense for purposes of
calculating the Purchase Price to the extent unpaid as of the Closing Date;
and provided, that at the Company's option, the EPL and fiduciary coverage
need only have a three year duration. The DandO Tail Policy shall provide
coverage to the Group Companies (other than Blocker), with the right to
directly access the DandO Tail Policy. If reasonably obtainable at no additional
expense, any "extended reporting" or "run-off" endorsements evidencing same
shall expressly be in the name of both the Company and Holdings Seller. Buyer,
Sellers and the Group Companies shall take no action to terminate coverage
under the DandO Tail Policy. The parties shall cooperate with the other party
(at such other party's sole cost and expense) with respect to any claims made
by such other party.

(c) The directors, officers, and managers of each Group Company entitled to
the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation and insurance set forth
in this Section 6.5 are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.5. This Section 6.5 shall survive the consummation of the
Transactions and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and
each Group Company.

Section 6.6 Exclusive Dealing. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company, any
other Group Company, nor any Seller shall take, nor shall the Company, any
other Group Company, or any Seller permit any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives, Affiliates, consultants, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take (directly or
indirectly), any of the following actions with any Person (other than Buyer
and/or its Affiliates): (a) solicit, entertain, encourage, facilitate,
initiate or engage in or conduct discussions or negotiations with, any Person
relating to any inquiry, contact, offer or proposal, oral, written or
otherwise, formal or informal, with respect to (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition of (A) any Group Company's Equity Interests, any right to acquire
any Equity Interests in any Group Company or any security convertible into or
exercisable for such Equity Interests, other than acquisitions under clause
(A) by employees of the Group Companies pursuant to pre-existing employee
benefit arrangements or (B) any merger, sale of substantial assets or similar
transaction involving any Group Company, other than assets sold in the
ordinary course of business, or (ii) any joint venture or other strategic
investment in or involving any Group Company (other than with or by Buyer
and/or its Affiliates) (each transaction described in clauses (i), and (ii),
an "Acquisition Transaction"); (b) provide any information with respect to any
Group Company to any Person other than Buyer and/or its Affiliates relating to
(or which the Company reasonably believes would be used for the purpose of
formulating) an offer or proposal with respect to, or otherwise assist,
cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by such Person
with regard to, any possible Acquisition Transaction for any Group Company;
(c) approve or agree to or enter into an agreement with any person other than
Buyer providing for an Acquisition Transaction for any Group Company; (d) make
or authorize any statement, recommendation, solicitation or endorsement in
support of any possible Acquisition Transaction for any Group Company other
than the Transaction; or (e) authorize or permit any directors, officers,
employees, managers, advisors, representatives or agents of any Group Company
to take any such action; provided, however, that Buyer hereby acknowledges
that prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has provided information
relating to the Group Companies and has afforded access to, and engaged in
discussions with, other Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition
Transaction and that such information, access and discussions could reasonably
enable another Person to form a basis for an Acquisition Transaction without
any breach by the Company



EAST\\\134549672.25 53

* * *





of this Section 6.6. The Company shall during the Pre-Closing Period promptly
notify Buyer after receipt by any Group Company or any Seller (or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, managers, agents, advisors or other
representatives) of any proposal for, or inquiry respecting, any Acquisition
Transaction, or any request for nonpublic information in connection with such
proposal or inquiry or for access to the management, properties, books or
records of any Group Company by any Person that informs or has informed any
Group Company or any Seller that it is considering making or has made such a
proposal or inquiry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may respond to
any unsolicited proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction by indicating
that the Company is subject to an exclusivity agreement and is unable to
provide any information related to the Group Companies or entertain any
proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning an
Acquisition Transaction for as long as that exclusivity agreement remains in
effect. Each Group Company and each Seller shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Transaction.

Section 6.7 Documents and Information.

(a) After the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause the
Group Companies to, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of
the Group Companies in existence on the Closing Date and make the same
available for inspection and copying by Sellers during normal business hours
of the Group Companies, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon
reasonable advance written notice. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer or the
Company for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting
Sellers pursuant to this Section 6.7(a). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing shall obligate the Buyer or any Group
Company to provide or make available to the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted
by any applicable Law, regulation or Order or the disclosure of which would
jeopardize any applicable attorney-client communication or work product
privilege.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the obligations of Buyer and
each Group Company contained in this Section 6.7 shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of Buyer and the Group Companies.

Section 6.8 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations.
During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer is not
authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of its employees,
agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employee (excluding
designated executive officers), customer, supplier, distributor or other
material business relation of any Group Company regarding any Group Company,
its business or the Transactions without the prior written consent of the
Company or Sellers' Representative; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
prohibited from contacting customers, suppliers, distributors or other
material business relations of the Buyer in the ordinary course and not
related to any Group Company, the Confidential Information or the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of Section 6.2(b) shall to
apply with respect to any communications or sharing of information pursuant to
this Section 6.8.

Section 6.9 Employee Benefits Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.9,
(a) during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide employees of each
Group Company with compensation that is no less favorable than the combined
base or hourly compensation and target incentive or bonus opportunities
(excluding any payments made pursuant to this Agreement or any change of
control bonuses, phantom equity plans, severance or bonus plans, or similar
arrangements (including any stay bonuses) payable to any current employee of a
Group Company as the sole result of the consummation of the Transactions which
are both disclosed on Schedule 3.15(q) and are included in Seller Expenses)
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (b)

arrangements maintained by the Group Companies as of the date of this
Agreement. Buyer further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause each Group Company to, grant all of its employees
credit for any service with such Group Company earned prior to the Closing
Date (i) for eligibility and vesting purposes, and (ii) for purposes of
vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations under any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may be established
or maintained by Buyer or any Group Company on or after the Closing Date other
than any equity compensation arrangements (the "New Plans"). In addition,
Buyer shall, if commercially feasible, take actions to (A) cause to be waived
all pre‑existing condition exclusions and actively‑at‑work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and (B) cause
any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or
before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of any
Group Company to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out‑of‑pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (x) shall
constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any Employee Benefit
Plan, (y) shall, subject to compliance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.9, alter or limit any Group Company's ability to amend, modify or
terminate any particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement as
required by Law, (z) is intended to confer upon any employee of any Group
Company any right to continued employment for any period beyond any such right
which may exist as of the Closing pursuant to any Contract or agreement
between any such employee, on the one hand, and any Group Company, on the
other hand (which Contract or agreement was not entered into in violation of
this Agreement). Buyer agrees that Buyer and each Group Company shall be
solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of
COBRA for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term
is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

Section 6.10 Disclosure Schedules. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company and Sellers' Representative has
delivered to Buyer the disclosure Schedules to this Agreement (the
"Schedules"). All Schedules and attached hereto are hereby incorporated in and
made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. The mere
inclusion of information in any Schedule hereto as an exception to a
representation, warranty or covenant (i)



EAST\\\134549672.25 55

* * *





shall not be deemed an admission by any Party that such information represents
a material exception or a material fact, event, condition, change, occurrence
or effect or that such information has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a "material adverse effect" on
Sellers' or Buyer's ability to consummate the Transactions, as applicable, or
(ii) constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any third party
concerning such information. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Matters disclosed to Buyer pursuant to any Section of or
Schedule to this Agreement (or any section of any Schedule to this Agreement)
will be deemed to be disclosed with respect to all Sections of and Schedules
to this Agreement (and all sections of all Schedules to this Agreement) to the
extent that the relevance of any such disclosure in such other Section or
Schedule is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure in such Section
or Schedule. Capitalized terms used in any Schedule to this Agreement but not
otherwise defined therein will have the respective meanings assigned to such
terms in this Agreement.

Section 6.11 Reorganization. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that prior to the
Closing, the Sellers, the Group Companies and their Affiliates may undertake
reorganization (the "Reorganization") as set forth in Exhibit E. Buyer agrees
that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement (including Section 6.1) or any
Ancillary Documents shall prohibit or restrict the consummation of (or any
agreements to consummate) the Reorganization. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers may modify the
Transactions undertaken in the Reorganization and may omit certain steps
described in, or take steps not described in, Exhibit E, but only to the
extent such modifications do not have a materially adverse impact on Buyer or
the Group Companies.

Section 6.12 Representation and Warranty Policy. A buyer-side representation
and warranty insurance policy underwritten by Concord Specialty Risk is being
conditionally bound as of the date hereof (the "RandW Insurance Policy").
Sellers shall bear fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the RandW Insurance Policy
(including underwriting fee, premium, premium taxes, and any broker expenses),
by including such amount as a Seller Expense, provided, however, that in no
event shall RandW Insurance Policy costs greater than $460,000 be included in
Seller Expenses or otherwise be payable by the Sellers in respect of the RandW
Insurance Policy. Any other fees, costs or deductibles associated therewith
shall be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer agrees to not seek to make, enter into
or consent to, any amendment to the RandW Insurance Policy following the Closing
that would materially and adversely affect the rights of the Sellers hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative.

local income Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods (including Straddle Periods). All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the respective past practices of the
Company and this Agreement, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
The Sellers' Representative shall deliver a draft of any such Tax Return to

Subsidiaries' respective past practices and applicable Law) and consent to the
filing of such Tax Returns (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Parties agree that Buyer's acquisition of the

Company (which, for purposes of this Section 6.13(a)(i), shall be referred to
as the "Terminated Partnership") under Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if an election
under Section 754 of the Code is not in effect for the Terminated Partnership

respective past practices and applicable Law) and consent to the filing of
such Tax Returns (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due
date of each such Tax Return, the Sellers' Representative shall pay to Buyer
(A) all Taxes shown to be due on each such Tax Return for a taxable period
that ends on or prior to the Closing Date, (B) all Taxes shown on any Tax
Return for a Straddle Period (determined in accordance with Section 6.13(g))
that are attributable to the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period
(except, in the case of (A) and (B), to the extent any such Tax was accrued as
a liability in determining Closing Net Working Capital or Funded Indebtedness)
and (C) all reasonable costs and expenses that Buyer (or any Group Company)

Tax Return to the Sellers' Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Tax Return in order to provide the
Sellers' Representative with the opportunity to review and comment on such Tax

practices and applicable Law) and consent to the filing of such Tax Returns
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No

Periods, provided that the Sellers' Representative shall provide Buyer with

reasonable comments of Buyer to such Blocker Refund Claims, to the extent such
comments are consistent with Blocker's past practices and applicable Law) and

cause the Blocker to) execute and timely file all such Blocker Refund Claims.

(e) Transaction Tax Deductions. The Parties agree that the Transaction Tax
Deductions shall be reported in the Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company, and

Closing Date. All such Transaction Tax Deductions shall be allocated to the
members of the Company as of the beginning of the Closing Date.

(f) Amendment of Tax Returns. Without the prior written consent of the

conditioned or delayed), the Buyer will not (i) file, refile, or amend or
permit the Company or the Blocker to file, refile, or amend any Tax Return
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any election with

any amounts, including under this Agreement or to any taxing authority.

this Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes attributable to a Straddle
Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, sales, payroll
or receipts of the Company or the Blocker for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or the Blocker
holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and
the amount of other Taxes of the Company or the Blocker for a Straddle Period
that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period.

(h) Tax Proceedings.

(i) If Buyer, the Company, or the Blocker receives notice of any audit or
other inquiry with respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period which would
reasonably be expected to affect the Tax liability of Sellers (taking into
account the indemnification and other provisions of this Agreement), the Buyer
shall promptly inform Sellers' Representative of such notice (which notice
shall include copies of any correspondences received from any taxing
authority).

(ii) At its election, the Sellers' Representative shall control, at the
Sellers' sole cost and expense, any Tax Proceeding of the Company or the
Blocker for a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Seller Tax Proceeding"). The Sellers'
Representative shall consult with the Buyer regarding any such Seller Tax

EAST\\\134549672.25 60

* * *





documents related thereto, permit the Buyer or its representative to attend
any such Seller Tax Proceeding, and not settle any issue therein without the
consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event that the Sellers' Representative does
not elect to control a Seller Tax Proceeding, the Buyer shall consult with the
Sellers' Representative regarding any such Seller Tax Proceeding, provide the
Sellers' Representative with information and documents related thereto, permit
the Sellers' Representative or its representative to attend any such Seller
Tax Proceeding, and not settle any issue therein without the consent of the
Sellers' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

all gross receipts, transfer Taxes, gains Taxes, real property transfer Taxes,
sales Taxes, use Taxes, excise Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes and any
other similar Taxes applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
Transactions shall be paid 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Sellers'
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers. The party primarily responsible for
preparing shall prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes, and the
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall cooperate in the preparation of
such Tax Returns.

(j) Tax Indemnification. From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall,
severally and jointly, indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer Indemnitees
harmless from and against any and all Losses with respect to or attributable
to (i) Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) imposed on a Group Company for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes that
result from the Reorganization or the Transactions), (ii) Taxes of any member
of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which a Group
Company is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local or foreign law, (iii) Taxes of any Person imposed on a Group Company as
a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, which Taxes
relate to an event or transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date,
(iv) Taxes of the Sellers; (v) any breach of the covenants contained in this
Section 6.13, and (vi) any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.15 (Tax Matters). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer
Indemnitees may not bring any claims for indemnity under this Section 6.13 or
under any other provision of this Agreement for any Taxes to the extent
included as liabilities in determining Closing Net Working Capital or Funded
Indebtedness. Any such recovery shall be treated as an adjustment to the
purchase price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law. The
covenants in this Section 6.13(j) shall survive until 5:00 pm Eastern Time on
the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date ("Tax Claims Survival
Period").

(k) Limitations Applicable to Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything else to
the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the limitations in Section 9.4 (save and
except those contained in Section 9.4(b) and Section 9.4(c)) shall apply to
indemnity claims made under Section 6.13(j); (ii) the maximum liability of the
Sellers under Section 6.13 shall in the aggregate be the Indemnity Escrow
Amount remaining at any given time in the Indemnity Escrow Account plus the
Tax Escrow Amount remaining at any given time in the Tax Escrow Account (the
"Tax Claims Cap"); and (iii) in no event shall the Buyer Indemnitees be
entitled to indemnification under Section 6.13(j) or Article 9 with respect to
Taxes that (a) are attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof)



EAST\\\134549672.25 61

beginning after the Closing Date, (b) are due to the unavailability in any
taxable period (or portion hereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net
operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (c) are attributable
to an action taken outside of the ordinary course of business after the
Closing on the Closing Date, (d) result from a breach of the covenants in this
Section 6.13, or (e) would not have been incurred but for the utilization in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of a net
operating loss generated in a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(l) Accounting Firm. Any dispute regarding the determination of Taxes covered
by this Section 6.13, including, but not limited to, the preparation of Tax
Returns, the determination of Tax refunds, the determination of Transaction
Tax Deductions, and the determination of indemnifiable Losses, shall be
resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.4(b)(ii). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in respect of
resolution of any such dispute shall be borne by Buyer on the one hand and
Sellers, on the other hand, in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of
the disputed items that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of the dispute
items submitted to the Accounting Firm.

Section 6.14 Release. For and in consideration of the amount to be paid to the
Sellers under this Agreement, and the additional covenants and promises set
forth in this Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents to which each Seller
is or becomes a party, effective as of the Closing Date, each Seller, both on
behalf of such Seller and all of such Seller's respective successors and
assigns (collectively, with Sellers, the "Releasors"), severally and not
jointly, hereby fully, finally and irrevocably releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and its
Affiliates, each Group Company, their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, general partners, limited partners, managing
directors, members, managers, trustees, representatives, employees,
principals, agents, parents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, predecessors,
successors, assigns, beneficiaries, heirs, executors, personal or legal
representatives, insurers and attorneys of any of them, and all holders of
Equity Interests of each Group Company prior to the Closing (each, a
"Releasee"), from and against any and all commitments, actions, debts, claims,
counterclaims, suits, causes of action, damages, demands, liabilities,
obligations, costs, expenses, and compensation of every kind and nature
whatsoever, at Law or in equity, whether known or unknown, contingent or
otherwise, which such Releasor, or any of them, had, has, or may have had at
any time in the past until and including the Closing Date against the
Releasees, or any of them (each, a "Released Claim"). Each Seller, and such
Seller's Releasors, agrees not to assert any Released Claim against the
Releasees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller, and such Seller's
Releasors, retains, and does not release (and shall not be deemed a Released
Claim), (a) its rights and interests under, or any claims pursuant to or in
connection with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any Ancillary
Document or any other agreement, certificate, instrument or other documents
executed and delivered in connection therewith (including with respect to
fraud thereunder), or (b) claims recoverable under any insurance policy
maintained by any of the Group Companies, or (c) any claim for
indemnification, liability limitation or exculpation in favor of the Sellers
or its Affiliates, officers, directors, partners, general partners, limited
partners, managing directors, members, or employees in their capacity as a
current or former director, officer, employee or agent of any Group Company in
connection with such



EAST\\\134549672.25 62

* * *





person's services as a director, officer or agent of a Group Company prior to
the Closing pursuant to their respective Governing Document, or (d) its rights
and interests under, or any claims pursuant to or in connection with the terms
and conditions of the Governing Documents of the Sellers (solely as to any
right, interest or claim of any Seller or equity holder of any Seller against
any other Seller or equity holder of any Seller thereunder) or any other
agreement or arrangement solely as between the Sellers and/or the equity
holders of the Sellers.

Section 6.15 Section 280G Cleansing Vote. Before the Closing Date, the
appropriate Group Company shall promptly submit to its equityholders for
approval, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, the payments and/or benefits that may separately or
in the aggregate constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of
the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination shall be made by the
Sellers and Group Companies and shall be subject to review and comment by
Buyer), such that such payments and benefits should not be deemed to be
Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer evidence satisfactory to Buyer that (i) a vote of the
equityholders was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite equityholder approval
was obtained with respect to the payments and/or benefits that were subject to
the equityholder vote (the "Section 280G Approval"), or (ii) the Section 280G
Approval was not obtained, and as a consequence, the payments and/or benefits
that were subject to equityholder approval shall not be made or provided to
the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments,
pursuant to valid waivers of those payments and/or benefits executed by the
affected individuals prior to the equityholder vote. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.15, Buyer will provide a summary of the
material terms of any arrangements entered into at the direction of Buyer or
between Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a "disqualified
individual," on the other hand (the "Buyer Arrangements"), along with the
estimated parachute value of any payments or benefits granted or contemplated
in such Buyer Arrangements, to the Sellers not less than five (5) days prior
to the Closing Date. The Company's failure to include the Buyer Arrangements
in the equityholder voting materials described herein, as a result of Buyer's
failure to provide the Buyer Arrangements in a timely manner, will not result
in a breach of the covenants set forth in this Section 6.15.

Section 6.16 Termination of Professional Services Agreement. At or prior to
the Closing, but after the payment of any Seller Expenses as contemplated by
this Agreement, Sellers' Representative shall, and shall cause the Company to,
take such action as may be necessary to cause the Professional Services
Agreement to be terminated pursuant to the form attached hereto as Exhibit G;
provided, that prior to such termination, Sellers shall have assigned all of
their and their Affiliates' respective rights and benefits under the
Professional Services Agreement to and for the benefit of the Company and the
Company shall have assumed all of the Sellers' and their Affiliates'
respective liabilities and obligations thereunder.

Section 6.17 Insurance Policies

(a) Sellers' Representative shall purchase the supplemental "extended
reporting period" provided for in Endorsement 7 of the Premises Pollution
Insurance Policy (the "Supplemental ERP") for an additional thirty-six (36)
months with an effective date of September



EAST\\\134549672.25 63

* * *





29, 2017; provided, that fifty percent (50%) of the cost (including
underwriting fee, premium, premium taxes, and any broker expenses) related to
the purchase of the Supplemental ERP shall be treated as Cash and Cash
Equivalents for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price. Sellers'
Representative shall on or prior to Closing deliver to Buyer (i) an e-mail
from the relevant underwriter or insurer confirming that the Sellers'
Representative has purchased the Supplemental ERP and (ii) evidence that the
premium for the Supplemental ERP has been paid. Unless the Sellers'
Representative causes the "first named insured" in the Premises Pollution
Insurance Policy to be changed from Holdings Seller to that of the Company,
then from and after the date hereof until the expiration of the extended
reporting period contemplated by the Supplemental ERP, Sellers' Representative
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain coverage under the
Premises Pollution Insurance Policy and shall promptly notify Buyer of any
communication relating to the Premises Pollution Insurance Policy, the
coverage thereunder, or any of the properties insured thereunder, provided
that the Sellers shall be under no obligation to purchase any additional
coverage or extension period or otherwise renew the Premises Pollution
Insurance Policy once it expires or terminates. From and after the Closing,
Buyer shall control any actions to be taken in respect of the Premises
Pollution Insurance Policy, in its sole discretion. Sellers' Representative
shall reasonably cooperate with and upon reasonable request, take direction
from Buyer (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) with respect to any claims or
any other matters noticed thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Sellers' Representative causes the "first named insured" in the Premises
Pollution Insurance Policy to be changed to that of the Company as above,
Holdings Seller shall continue to be an "additional insured" under such
Premises Pollution Insurance Policy (including the Supplemental ERP).

(b) Sellers' Representative shall purchase the optional extension period (the
"Beazley OEP") provided for in the Beazley Breach Response Policy No.
W199BB150101 (the "Beazley Policy") for 12 months with an effective date of
the Closing Date; provided, that the net cost (including underwriting fee,
premium, premium taxes, and any broker expenses) related to the purchase of
the Beazley OEP shall be treated as Cash and Cash Equivalents for purposes of
calculating the Purchase Price. Sellers' Representative shall on or prior to
Closing deliver to Buyer (i) an e-mail from the relevant underwriter or
insurer confirming that the Sellers' Representative has agreed to purchase the
Beazley OEP with an effective date of the Closing Date and (ii) evidence that
the premium for the Beazley OEP has been paid. Unless the Sellers'
Representative causes the "Named Insured" designated in Item 1 of the
declarations of the Beazley Policy to be changed from Holdings Seller to that
of the Company, then, from and after the date hereof until the expiration of
the option extension period contemplated by the Beazley OEP, Sellers'
Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
coverage under the Beazley Policy and shall promptly notify Buyer of any
communication relating to the Beazley Policy or to the coverage thereunder,
provided that the Sellers shall be under no obligation to purchase any
additional coverage or extension period or otherwise renew the Beazley Policy
once it expires or terminates. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume
the conduct and control of any actions required to be taken in respect of the
Beazley Policy, in its sole discretion. Sellers' Representative shall
reasonably cooperate with and upon reasonable request take direction from
Buyer (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) with respect to any claims or any
other matters noticed thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Sellers'
Representative causes the "first name insured" in the Beazley Policy to be



EAST\\\134549672.25 64

* * *





changed to that of the Company, Holdings Seller shall continue to be an
"additional insured" under such Beazley Policy (including the Beazley OEP).

(c) Sellers' Representative shall, at the written reasonable request of Buyer,
transfer any proceeds received under the Existing Holdings Insurance Policies
that pertain to any period on or after the Closing Date to Buyer. For
avoidance of doubt, Sellers' Representative shall retain its rights under the
DandO Tail, the Premises Pollution Insurance Policy (including the Supplemental
ERP) and the Beazley Policy (including the Beazley OEP) (collectively, the
"Claims Made Policies"). Holdings Seller shall have the right to (i) cancel
the Existing Holdings Insurance Policies (other than the Claims Made Policies)
effective at or after the Closing Date (but in a manner that does not
retroactively affect coverage for any Group Company for occurrences, claims,
accidents, or events taking place prior to the Closing Date), or (ii) replace
the "first named insured" in the Existing Holdings Insurance Policies with the
name of the Company. If Holdings Seller chooses not to so cancel or replace
the name of the "first named insured", then Sellers' Representative shall use

insured is a Group Company, during the Pre-Closing Period, Sellers shall cause

policies.

may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(c) by Sellers' Representative, if any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer set forth in Article 5 shall not be true and correct such that the
condition to Closing set forth



EAST\\\134549672.25 67

* * *





in Section 7.3(a) would not be satisfied, or any condition in Section 7.3 is

Article 10 and the last sentence of Section 6.2, each of which provisions
shall survive such termination and remain valid and binding obligations of the
Parties, and (b) any liability of any Party for any willful breach of or

course of dealing or other failure of any Party to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall constitute a waiver of such rights.

ARTICLE 9

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties of the Company, Sellers, Blocker and Buyer
contained in (i) Article 3 (except Section 3.15), Article 4 and Article 5, as
the case may be, or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i)
or Section 2.3(b)(iii), as the case may be, shall survive the Closing until
5:00 pm Eastern Time on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date
(such earlier date, the "Survival Period Termination Date") and (ii) Section
3.15 (Tax Matters) or in any related certificate delivered pursuant to Section
2.3(b)(i) or Section 2.3(b)(iii), as the case may be, shall survive until the
Tax Claims Survival Period. Claims for breaches of covenants and agreements
that contemplate performance prior to the Closing may be made at any time
prior to the Survival Period Termination Date. Any representation, warranty or
covenant that would otherwise terminate in accordance with the preceding
sentences will continue to survive (but only with respect to matters described
in such notice) if a written notice shall have been timely given on or prior
to such termination date until the related claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this Article 9. All covenants
that contemplate performance following the Closing shall survive in accordance
with their respective term as provided in this Agreement or, if none, until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation.

Section 9.2 General Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article 9, from and after the
Closing, each of the Buyer and/or its officers, directors, employees, members,
partners, managers, Affiliates, representatives and/or agents (each a "Buyer
Indemnitee") shall be entitled to assert claims (whether or not arising out of
Third Party Claims (as defined below)) against the Indemnity Escrow Account



EAST\\\134549672.25 69

* * *





in respect of damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, claims of any kind,
interest or expenses (including penalties, reasonable attorneys', accountants'
and other professionals' fees and expenses, court costs and all amounts paid
in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing) (each a
"Loss") incurred or arising as a result of or otherwise related to (i) any
breach of representation or warranty made by the Company or Blocker contained
in Article 3 or Sellers contained in Article 4 or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i) (except, in each case, for breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (Tax Matters)), and
(ii) any breach by the Company (prior to the Closing), the Blocker (prior to
the Closing) or any of the Sellers of any of the covenants or agreements
contained herein which are to be performed by the Company (prior to the
Closing), the Blocker (prior to the Closing) or Sellers (except, in each case,
for breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in Section 6.13 (Tax
Matters)). Subject to the other provisions of this Article 9, claims made
pursuant to the terms of Section 9.2(a) shall be made solely against the
Indemnity Escrow Account.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article 9, from and after the
Closing, each Group Company shall (and Buyer shall cause each Group Company
to) indemnify, defend and hold each Seller, its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, members, partners, managers,
representatives and agents (each a "Seller Indemnitee") harmless from any Loss
incurred or arising as a result of or otherwise related to (i) any breach of
representation or warranty made by Buyer contained in Article 5 (or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(iii)), (ii) any breach by
Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained herein, and (iii) any
breach by Buyer or the Company of any of its covenants or agreements contained
herein which are to be performed by the Company or any other Group Company
after the Closing or by Buyer.

(c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to this Section
9.2 shall survive the consummation of the Transactions for the applicable
period set forth in Section 9.1, except for claims for indemnification
asserted prior to the end of such applicable period (which claims shall
survive until final resolution thereof).

Section 9.3 Third Party Claims.

(a) If a claim, action, suit or Proceeding by a Person who is not a Party or
an Affiliate thereof (a "Third Party Claim") is made against any Person
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 6.13(j) hereof
(an "Indemnified Party"), and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with
respect thereto under this Article 9 or Section 6.13, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Party obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party
(or, in the case of a Buyer Indemnitee seeking indemnification, such Buyer
Indemnitee shall promptly notify Sellers' Representative, in each case, such
notified Party, the "Responsible Party") of such claims; provided that the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall identify in reasonable detail
and in good faith the basis under which indemnification is sought pursuant to
Section 9.2 or Section 6.13 (as the case may be) and enclose true and correct
copies of any written document furnished to the Indemnified Party by the
Person that instituted the Third Party Claim. The Responsible Party shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and
control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the



EAST\\\134549672.25 70

* * *





expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and
the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Responsible Party in connection therewith; provided that the
Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party).
So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in
good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such claim; provided that in such event it shall waive any
right to indemnity in respect of such claim unless the Responsible Party shall
have consented to such payment or settlement. If the Responsible Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the receipt of
the Indemnified Party's notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it
elects to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The
Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim to all Indemnified
Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article 9 to the contrary, the Responsible Party shall not have the right to
assume the defense under this Section 9.3 for any Third Party Claim (i) where
material non-monetary relief is sought that is not merely incidental to the
monetary relief that is sought, (ii) involving criminal or quasi-criminal
allegations, (iii) that could reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the Indemnified Party's business, or (iv) involving the Responsible
Party or its Affiliates as parties if counsel to the Responsible Party
determines in good faith that joint representation would give rise to a
conflict of interest, in each case, for which defense shall be assumed by the
Indemnified Party with the right to retain (at the Responsible Party's
expense) counsel of its choice.

(b) All of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and the Indemnified Party (or a duly authorized
representative of such Party) shall (and shall cause the other Group Companies
to) furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested by the Responsible Party in connection therewith.

Section 9.4 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. The rights of the
Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement are subject to the following limitations, other than in the event of
Actual Fraud:

(a) the amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any
amounts actually recovered by the Buyer Indemnitees under insurance policies
or other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person
which are contained outside of this Agreement) with respect to such Losses;
provided, however, that the Buyer Indemnitees shall be under no obligation to
litigate against any key customer or key supplier and shall have the right to
assert multiple claims under any insurance policy in the order it deems
appropriate in its sole judgment; provided, further, that the amount deemed to
be so received under insurance policies shall be net of the deductible



EAST\\\134549672.25 71

* * *





for such policies and net of the out-of-pocket costs incurred by such Buyer
Indemnitee in connection with obtaining such proceeds, and (ii) any net Tax
benefits actually realized by the Buyer Indemnitees (or their direct or
indirect beneficial owners) with respect to such Losses with respect to Tax
Returns for the year of such Loss and the immediately succeeding year;

(b) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover for any particular
Loss (or series of related Losses) pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than
claims arising out of or resulting from the breach of a Fundamental
Representation) unless such Loss (or series of related Losses) equals or
exceeds $30,000, after which point the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to
recover from the first dollar of such Losses (subject to the other limitations
set forth in this Article 9);

(c) except for any breach of any Fundamental Representation, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i) until the total amount which the Buyer Indemnitees would recover
under Section 9.2(a)(i) (as limited by the provisions of this Section 9.4)
exceeds $1,635,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case, the Buyer Indemnitees
shall only be entitled to recover Losses in excess of the Deductible;

(d) subject to Section 9.6, (i) except for any breach of any Fundamental
Representation, the Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining at any given time in the
Indemnity Escrow Account (the "Cap") shall be the sole and exclusive source of
recovery with respect to any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.2(a),
and in no event shall the Buyer Indemnitees be entitled to recover more than
the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 9.2(a) in the
aggregate, (ii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining at any given time in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and the Holdback Amount retained by Sellers'
Representative pursuant to Section 9.9 shall be the sole and exclusive sources
of recovery with respect to any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i) for any breach of any Fundamental Representation, (iii) the
Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining at any given time in the Indemnity Escrow
Account and the Tax Escrow Amount remaining at any given time in the Tax
Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive sources of recovery with
respect to any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 6.13, and (iv) the
Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to Section
9.2(a) or Section 6.13 if such Loss is due to the Buyer Indemnitees filing a
Tax Return, or taking a position for Tax purposes, that is inconsistent with
both (A) applicable Law and (B) a position taken on a Tax Return that was
filed on or before the Closing Date;

(e) in no event shall any Buyer Indemnitees be entitled to receive
indemnification for the same Loss more than once under this Article 9 or
Section 6.13(j) even if a claim for indemnification in respect of such Loss
has been made as a result of a breach of more than one (1) representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;

(f) each Indemnified Party shall, if and to the extent required by applicable
Laws, use good faith efforts to mitigate any Loss for which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification hereunder;

(g) except for the Qualified Representations, the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement or any certificate or schedule
delivered in connection herewith that are qualified as to "material,"
"materiality," "material respects," "Company Material Adverse Effect"



EAST\\\134549672.25 72

* * *





or words of similar import or effect shall be deemed to have been made without
any such qualification for purposes of determining whether a breach of any
such representation or warranty has occurred and the amount of Losses
resulting from, arising out of or relating to any such breach;

(h) in no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 or Section 6.13 with respect to a specific Loss to
the extent such Loss is (i) clearly and separately reserved for on the face of
the Latest Balance Sheet or in the footnotes to any other Financial Statements
or (ii) is included in the calculation of the Purchase Price, as finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.4(b); and

(i) no Buyer Indemnitee shall make any claim for indemnification with respect
to any environmental investigatory, corrective, remedial or response action or
report to any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Response Action") except to
the extent such Response Action is (i) affirmatively required by Environmental
Laws, or an Order or written demand by a Governmental Entity; (ii) reasonably
necessary to respond to substantial endangerment to human health, safety, the
environment, or natural resources; (iii) required to respond to a bona fide
third party claim or bona fide employee complaint arising under Environmental
Laws or alleging exposure to Hazardous Substances; (iv) required in connection
with a bona fide maintenance project to the extent consistent with industry
practice; or (v) a bona fide report to any Governmental Entity consistent with
industry practice and not for the affirmative purpose of seeking an Order or
written demand for Response Action, and is attributable to a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.11, and then only to the
extent any such Response Action is conducted in a cost-effective manner and
required to attain compliance with minimum remedial standards applicable under
Environmental Laws based on continued industrial or commercial uses, employing
risk based standards and institutional controls where available.

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, but subject to
Section 9.6, after the Closing, (i) on the date that the Indemnity Escrow
Amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account is reduced to zero, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall have no further rights to indemnification from any person
under Section 9.2(a) or otherwise under or pursuant to this Agreement (other
than in the case of a breach of the Fundamental Representations) and (ii) on
the date that the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Tax Escrow Amount remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow Account and the Tax Escrow Account, respectively, is
reduced to zero, the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no further rights to
indemnification from any person under Section 6.13(j). In any case where a
Buyer Indemnitee recovers, under insurance policies (but subject to Section
9.6) or from other collateral sources, any amount in respect of a matter for
which such Buyer Indemnitee was indemnified pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or
Section 6.13(j), such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to Sellers'
Representative the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount
of the expenses incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee in procuring such recovery,
and any Losses for which Buyer Indemnitee had no other source of recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid to or on
behalf of such Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such matter, and (ii) any amount
expended by Sellers in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such
matter under Section 9.3.

Section 9.5 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary but subject to Section 9.6 and Section 10.14, except
in the case of Actual Fraud, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 9 and Section 6.13 shall be the exclusive remedy for the Parties
for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other
provision contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Document or in any other
certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto
(including with respect to any matters arising under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended).

Section 9.6 Manner of Payment; Escrow.

(a) Any payments for indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees pursuant to this Article 9 or Section 6.13(j) shall be effected by
wire transfer of immediately available funds from the applicable Persons to an
account designated in writing by the applicable Buyer Indemnitees or Seller
Indemnitees, as the case may be, within fifteen (15) days after the final
determination thereof; provided, however, that:

(i) any indemnification obligation to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) (except for any indemnification obligation to Buyer Indemnitees
with respect to any breach of any Fundamental Representation) hereunder shall
be satisfied in the following order: (A) in the first instance, from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount until the Indemnity Escrow Amount is, or would be,
exhausted, released or otherwise reserved for pending claims in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, after which (B) in the last instance,
all other indemnification obligations contemplated by this subclause (i) in
excess of such amount shall be satisfied by and subject to the terms of the
RandW Insurance Policy;

(ii) any indemnification obligation to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 6.13(j) shall be satisfied in the following order: (A) until the
retention amount under the RandW Insurance Policy is met in full (1) in the
first instance, from the Indemnity Escrow Account until the Indemnity Escrow
Amount is, or would be, exhausted, released or otherwise reserved for pending
claims in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, after which (2) in
the second instance, from the Tax Escrow Account until the Tax Escrow Amount
is, or would be exhausted, released or otherwise reserved for pending claims

retention amount under the RandW Insurance Policy shall have been met in full,
any other indemnification obligations contemplated by this subclause (ii) in
excess of the amounts contemplated by subclause (ii)(A) above shall be
satisfied by and subject to the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy; and

(iii) (A) until the retention amount under the RandW Insurance Policy is met in
full, the sole recourse of the Buyer Indemnitees for any indemnification
obligation pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) hereunder with respect to any breach
of any Fundamental Representation shall be (1) in the first instance, the
Indemnity Escrow Account until the Indemnity Escrow Amount is, or would be,
exhausted, released or otherwise reserved for pending claims in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement and (2) thereafter, the Holdback Amount
held by Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section 9.9; and (B) after the



EAST\\\134549672.25 74

* * *





retention amount under the RandW Insurance Policy shall have been met in full,
any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) hereunder with
respect to any breach of any Fundamental Representation (1) shall be first
satisfied by and subject to the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, and (2)
after the Buyer Indemnitees exhaust all funds and collection rights under the
RandW Insurance Policy, then in the last instance, the sole recourse of the
Buyer Indemnitees for any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i) hereunder with respect to any breach of any Fundamental
Representation shall be from the Holdback Amount held by Sellers'
Representative pursuant to Section 9.9.

(b) Any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Account as of the Survival Period Termination Date and any portion of
Tax Escrow Amount remaining in the Tax Escrow Account at the expiry of the Tax
Claims Survival Period (minus the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to timely claims made against such funds in accordance
with this Agreement and not fully resolved prior to such date) shall be
released to Sellers' Representative. At any time following the Survival Period
Termination Date, to the extent the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account exceeds the aggregate amount claimed
by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to timely claims made prior to such Survival
Period Termination Date and not fully resolved prior to the time of
determination, such excess shall be promptly released to Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). At any time following the expiry of
the Tax Claims Survival Period, to the extent the portion of the Tax Escrow
Amount remaining in the Tax Escrow Account exceeds the aggregate amount
claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to timely claims made prior to the
expiry of the Tax Claims Survival Period and not fully resolved prior to the
time of determination, such excess shall be promptly released to Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers).

(c) Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make any distributions
from the Indemnity Escrow Account and/or the Tax Escrow Account as provided
for herein.

Section 9.7 Purchase Price Adjustment. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

Section 9.8 Subrogation. If a Responsible Party makes an indemnification
payment to an Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss, then such
Responsible Party will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
related rights and remedies of such Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy or otherwise against or with respect to such Loss, except with respect
to amounts not yet recovered by such Indemnified Party (or any other such
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder) under any such insurance policy
or otherwise that already have been netted against such Loss for purposes of
determining the indemnifiable amount of such Loss. Promptly following such
Responsible Party's request, such Indemnified Party will take all reasonably
necessary, proper or desirable actions (including the execution and delivery
of any document reasonably requested) to accomplish the foregoing.

Section 9.9 Holdback Obligation. From and after the Closing, Sellers'
Representative shall retain in an interest bearing account an amount of funds
received from Buyer equal to the Holdback Amount, to be held by Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) to support Sellers'



EAST\\\134549672.25 75

* * *





indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) hereunder solely
with respect to any breach of any Fundamental Representation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Sellers' Representative's obligations under
this Section 9.9 hereof shall terminate on the Survival Period Termination
Date; provided, however, that such retention obligation shall continue in full
force and effect on and after the Survival Period Termination Date with
respect to any pending indemnification claims for any breach of any
Fundamental Representation duly asserted by Buyer prior to the Survival Period
Termination Date pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) hereunder, but only with
respect to the aggregate amount of such pending claims (each, a "Continuing
Claim") and until such time as such claims are resolved. Sellers'
Representative shall continue to hold such amounts to support the Sellers'
indemnification obligations with respect to such Continuing Claims until the
final resolution thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 10.3 Governing Law. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, the
relationship of the Parties, the transaction leading to this Agreement or
contemplated hereby and/or the interpretation and/or enforcement of the
respective rights and duties of the Parties hereunder or related in any way to
the foregoing, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal, substantive Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements
entered into and to be performed solely within such state, without giving
effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 10.4 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses;
provided that in the event that the Transactions are consummated, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Group Companies to, pay all unpaid Seller Expenses set
forth on the Closing Date Statement, in accordance with, and to the accounts
of the third parties specified in, the Closing Date Statement, in accordance
with Section 2.3(a)(iv).

Section 10.5 Construction; Interpretation. The headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective
counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of
construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall
be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against
any Party. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or
use thereof: (a) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules and
Exhibits, and not to any particular section, subsection, paragraph,
subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (b) masculine gender shall
also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; (c) words
importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice versa; (d) the
words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation"; (e) references to a Person are also to its
successors and permitted assigns; (f) the word "extent" in the phrase of "to
the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase shall not mean simply "if"; and (g) any reference to any month
or any day period shall mean the calendar month or the calendar day period
unless expressly specified otherwise.

Section 10.6 Exhibits and Schedules. All exhibits and Schedules, or documents
expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in this
Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule



EAST\\\134549672.25 79

* * *





referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other sections is readily apparent on its
face. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement (or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto) or the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement.

Section 10.7 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in Section 6.5, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, prior to
the Closing, each Seller shall have the right, on behalf of its holders of
Equity Interests, to pursue equitable remedies pursuant to Section 10.15 or,
if such equitable remedies are not sought or are not granted as a remedy,
damages; provided, however, that the rights granted pursuant to this sentence
will be enforceable on behalf of Sellers' holders of Equity Interests only by
the Sellers in their sole and absolute discretion.

Section 10.8 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable under applicable Law, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

Section 10.9 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 10.10 Knowledge of the Company. For all purposes of this Agreement,
the phrase "to the Company's knowledge," "to the knowledge of the Company,"
and "known by the Company" and any derivations thereof shall mean, the actual
knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of any of Peter Kelly, Richard
Obrigawitch, Gregg Kornfeld or Ron Childs. For this purpose, "reasonable
inquiry" means, with respect to each such Person due inquiry of their direct
reports who have responsibilities, or would reasonably be expected to have
knowledge, pertinent to such matter. No such person shall have any personal
liability in their capacity as a person whose "knowledge" is being ascribed to
that of the Company pursuant to this Section 10.10.

Section 10.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN
RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH
CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT
ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER
OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 10.12 Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, in any action or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court, and (c) agrees not to bring any action or Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other Party with respect
thereto. Each Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other
process that might be served in any action or Proceeding may be made on such
Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served
at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 10.3. Nothing in this Section 10.12, however, shall affect
the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law. Each Party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or
Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

Section 10.13 Waiver of Conflicts; Jointly Privileged Information.

(a) Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has acted as legal counsel to
Sellers, its Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that
Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Sellers and its
Affiliates (which will no longer include the Group Companies) after the
Closing, each of Buyer and the Group Companies hereby waives, on its own
behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing Sellers and/or its
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, any
Group Company or the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between Sellers, its
Affiliates or any Group Company and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Engagement") shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences
that belong solely to Sellers and its Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies). Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, in each case with
respect to the Engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after



EAST\\\134549672.25 81

* * *





the Closing, (i) Sellers and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies)
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the
Engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to
the extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP with respect to the Engagement
constitute property of the client, only Sellers and its Affiliates (and not
the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights, and (iii) Kirkland and
Ellis LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and
any of the Group Companies with respect to the Engagement.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, Sellers shall be permitted to remove from the Group Companies any
email, document and other records to the extent containing attorney-client
privileged information with respect to the Engagement where the attorney-
client privilege is held jointly between one or more of the Group Companies on
the one hand, and any of Sellers and its Affiliates on the other hand
("Jointly Privileged Information"). From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
cause the Group Companies to provide to Sellers all copies (including
electronic, digital, or otherwise) of any Jointly Privileged Information that
is inadvertently not removed prior to the Closing to the extent specifically
requested by the Sellers; provided that neither Buyer, the Group Companies nor
any of their Affiliates shall have any obligation following the Closing to
conduct a search for Jointly Privileged Information or to notify Kirkland and
Ellis LLP, Seller or their Affiliates of the existence of any information in
its' possession which may constitute Jointly Privileged Information. Sellers
agree that any email, document and other record temporarily removed for
analysis to determine the presence of Jointly Privileged Information pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 10.13(b) shall be returned (without
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Seller or their Affiliates retaining any copies thereof
except as may be required by Law or bona fide internal document retention
policies) to the Group Companies promptly following completion of such review
(which shall be concluded prior to the Closing) if it is determined by Sellers
that such email, document or other record does not contain Jointly Privileged
Information.

Section 10.14 Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein
(including Section 8.2), any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform
their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
the Transactions) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent or remedy breaches of this Agreement by other Parties and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Buyer's
obligations to consummate the Transactions if it is required to do so
hereunder), in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of



EAST\\\134549672.25 82

* * *





this Agreement on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at
Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity.

Section 10.15 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that no recourse
under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection
with this Agreement shall be had by Buyer or its Affiliates against any
current or future director, officer, employee or member of Sellers or of any
Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such, whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable Proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on or otherwise be incurred by any current or future officer, agent or
employee of Sellers or any current or future member of Sellers or any current
or future director, officer, employee or member of Sellers or of any Affiliate
or assignee thereof, as such, for any obligation of Sellers under this
Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this
Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such
obligations or their creation.

Section 10.16 Sellers' Representative.

(a) Holdings Seller is hereby constituted, authorized and appointed to act as
the Sellers' Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Sellers' Representative" shall mean the representative, true, lawful and
exclusive agent, proxy and attorney in fact of the Sellers for all purposes of
this Agreement and the Transactions, including pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, with full power and authority to act on each Seller's behalf,
including the power and authority: (i) to consummate the Transactions, (ii) to
pay each Seller's expenses (whether incurred prior to, on or after the date
hereof) incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (iii) to receive, give receipt and disburse
any funds (including the Holdback Amount) received hereunder or under the
Escrow Agreement on behalf of or to each Seller and to hold back from
disbursement any such funds to the extent it reasonably determines may be
necessary, (iv) to execute and deliver on behalf of Sellers any documents
contemplated herein or any amendment hereto or any documents contemplated in
any of the Ancillary Documents (with such modifications or changes therein as
to which the Sellers' Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have
consented), (v) to take (or refrain from taking) all other actions to be taken
by or on behalf of Sellers in connection herewith, (vi) to negotiate, settle,
compromise and otherwise handle all disputes under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, including disputes regarding the Purchase Price and any
adjustment thereto, (vii) as the Sellers' Representative, to enforce and
protect the rights and interests of Sellers and to enforce and protect the
rights and interests of the Sellers' Representative arising out of or under or
in any manner relating to this Agreement, and each other agreement, document,
instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein, and to take any and
all actions which the Sellers' Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents for and on behalf
of Sellers, including asserting or pursuing any claim, action, Proceeding or
investigations against Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company), (viii) investigate, defend, contest, litigate or appeal
any claim, action, Proceeding or investigation initiated by Buyer or any other
Person, or by any Governmental Entity against the Sellers' Representative
and/or any Seller, and receive process on behalf of any or all of Sellers in
any such claim, action, Proceeding or investigation



EAST\\\134549672.25 83

* * *





and compromise or settle on such terms as the Sellers' Representative shall
determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with
respect to, any such claim, action, Proceeding or investigation, (ix) to
execute and deliver any consents under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents and to waive any term or condition in any of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents, including any condition to the obligation of Sellers to
consummate the Transactions or therein, (x) to give and receive notices on
behalf of Sellers, (xi) to engage agents, accountants, attorneys and other
representatives and (xii) to do each and every act and exercise any and all
rights which any Seller is, or Sellers collectively are, permitted or required
to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents and, in
general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that the
Sellers' Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider
necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the
Transactions, the Escrow Agreement and all other agreements, documents or
instruments referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith
and therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, any action permitted to be taken by
the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this Section 10.16(a) is not required
to be taken by Sellers' Representative and Sellers' Representative may refrain
from taking such action, except to the extent this Agreement expressly
requires the Sellers' Representative to take a particular action. Each Seller,
by approving the principal terms of the Transactions and/or accepting the
consideration payable to them hereunder or thereunder, irrevocably grant unto
said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and authority to do and perform
each and every act and thing necessary or desirable to be done in connection
with the Transactions, as fully to all intents and purposes as Sellers might
or could do in person. Each Seller agrees that such agency and proxy are
coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Sellers' Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity or bankruptcy
of any Seller. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Sellers' Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date
and/or any termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

(b) All decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the Sellers'
Representative shall be final and binding upon each and all Sellers and no
Seller shall have any right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest
the same, except to the extent of any Actual Fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Sellers' Representative. Neither the Sellers'
Representative nor any agent employed by the Sellers' Representative shall
incur any liability relating to the performance of its duties hereunder to any
Seller, except to the extent an action or omission by Sellers' Representative
is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted
Actual Fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Sellers'
Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Seller, except in respect of amounts actually
received on behalf of a Seller. Each Seller agrees that the Sellers'
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement. The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable to any Seller
for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith,
and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to
have been made in error, the sole recourse of a Seller to which payment was
due, but not made, shall be to recover from a Seller any payment in excess of
the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers' Representative shall not be
obligated to take any actions and shall be entitled to take such actions as
the Sellers' Representative deems appropriate in its sole discretion.
