17  set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Sellers Representatives
disagreement with the Buyers determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment,
the US dollar amounts of the proposed adjustments and the Sellers
Representatives good faith estimate of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If no
Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer within such thirty (30) day
period, then the Post-Closing Certificate (and the Post-Closing Adjustment
reflected therein) shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Sellers
Representative, shall become final and binding upon the Parties and shall be
the "Final Closing Statement."

(e) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, the Parties shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to any item specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such thirty (30) day period the
Parties have been unable to agree upon a Final Closing Statement, the Parties
shall submit to the Neutral Accountant for review and resolution any and all
items set out in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The
Neutral Accountant shall use commercially practicable efforts to make a final
determination of the items that remain in dispute with respect to the
determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment within thirty (30) days. The
Post-Closing Adjustment, as so determined, shall be final and binding upon the
Parties for all purposes of this Agreement and shall be the "Final Closing
Adjustment," and the Post-Closing Certificate reflecting amounts agreed by the
Parties and the Final Closing Adjustment as determined pursuant to this
paragraph, shall become final and binding upon the Parties and shall be the
"Final Closing Statement." During the thirty (30) day review by the Neutral
Accountant, the Parties shall make available to the Neutral Accountant access
to such individuals, information, books and records as may be reasonably
required by the Neutral Accountant to make its final determination. The
Neutral Accountant may not make any determination with respect to any items
not set forth in the Notice of Disagreement or with respect to items
otherwise resolved by Buyer and the Sellers Representative and any items set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement shall be resolved based upon the
determination of the Neutral Accountant and shall be deemed to be part of the
Final Closing Statement. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall
be shared equally between the Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and
the Buyer, on the other hand.

(f) If the Final Closing Adjustment as finally determined pursuant to the
Final Closing Statement is a positive number, then the Buyer shall pay to
Sellers Representative an amount equal to the Final Closing Adjustment. If
the Final Closing Adjustment as finally determined is a negative number, then
Sellers Representative shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the product of
(i) the Final Closing Adjustment multiplied by (ii) negative one. Any payment
by Buyer or Sellers Representative pursuant to this Section 2.5(f) shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the recipient of such payment, within seven (7) days after the amount of
the Final Closing Adjustment becomes final and binding on the Parties (the
date such payment is made, the "Closing Adjustment Payment Date"), and shall
include interest thereon from the Closing Date until the Closing Adjustment
Payment Date at an annual interest rate of five percent (5%).



 

18 2.6. _Consideration for Non-Competition_. Sellers acknowledge and agree that a
portion of the Purchase Price equal to $1,170,000 represents consideration
for the restrictive covenants contained in Section 7.1 of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers acknowledge that Buyer would not have
entered into the transactions contemplated herein without the restrictive
covenants contained in Section 7.1 of this Agreement. In the event of a breach
of the restrictive covenants contained in Section 7.1 of this Agreement, the
parties acknowledge and agree that such allocation shall not be deemed to be
a measure of the damages that would result from such a breach and Sellers and
the Sellers Representative agree that at no time shall they argue or in any
way assert in any proceeding relating hereto or otherwise, that such
consideration is a measure of the damages resulting from such breach.

2.7. _Collection and Assignment of Excluded Accounts Receivable and Actual
Uncollected Accounts Receivable; and Payment for Reduction to Related Accounts
Payable_.

(a) If at any time prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date
any Excluded Accounts Receivable or Actual Uncollected Accounts Receivable
shall be collected by the Company, then the Company shall pay to Sellers an
amount equal to such collections less all reasonable collection costs related
to all Excluded Accounts Receivable or Actual Uncollected Accounts Receivable
which have not been previously deducted from any payment pursuant to
this Section 2.7(a). If upon the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date
any Excluded Accounts Receivable or Actual Uncollected Accounts Receivable
remain uncollected and Jon continues to be employed by the Company on such
date, then the Company shall assign all of its rights to such Excluded
Accounts Receivable and Actual Uncollected Accounts Receivable to the Sellers.
If Jon is not employed by the Company at such time, then the Company shall
hold such Excluded Accounts Receivable and Actual Uncollected Accounts
Receivable and if collected will pay Sellers such amounts collected less all
reasonable collection costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
only make such efforts to collect such Excluded Accounts Receivable and
Actual Uncollected Accounts Receivable as it deems reasonable in its
discretion taking into account the detrimental impact such collection efforts
could have on the business of the Company.

(b) If at any time prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date
any accounts payable included in the Actual Net Working Capital to
subcontractors on the Actual Uncollected Accounts Receivable or Excluded
Accounts Receivable jobs are settled by binding agreement with such
subcontractors such that the amount of any such account payable is permanently
reduced, then the Company shall pay to the Sellers the amount of such
reduction.

2.8. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment and Assignment for Retainage_.
If upon the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date any retainage
included in the Actual Net Working Capital is not collected, the Sellers shall
jointly and severally pay to Buyer an amount equal to all such
uncollected retainage. Upon receipt of such payment the Company shall assign
all of its rights to such uncollected retainage to Sellers so long as Jon
remains employed by the Company at such time. If Jon is not employed by the
Company at such time, then the Company shall hold such retainage and if
collected will pay Sellers such amounts collected less all  



 

19  reasonable collection costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall only make such efforts to collect such retainage as it deems reasonable
in its discretion taking into account the detrimental impact such collection
efforts could have on the business of the Company.

of them relate to a Seller, and with respect to which such Seller shall be
solely responsible: 

4.1. _Organization and Good Standing_.

power and authority to own or use the assets that it purports to own or use
(including their respective shares), and to perform all of its obligations

been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or trust action
(as the case may be) on the part of the Company or the Sellers, as applicable,
and no other corporate or trust (as the case may be) action on the part of
the Company or the Sellers is necessary to authorize this Agreement or the

Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

provision of the Organizational Documents of the Company, QTIP, IDIT or GRAT

"Interim Financial Statements").

(b) The Financial Statements in each case: (i) are complete and correct and
were prepared in accordance with the books and records of the Company, (ii)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (subject, in
the case of the Interim Financials and the Reviewed Financial Statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments, the effect of which will not, individually
or in the aggregate, be materially adverse and the absence of notes that, if
presented, would not  



 

24  differ materially from those included in the Audited Financial Statements),
and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the financial condition
as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flow of the Company as at the respective dates
of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements. The Companys
utilization of the percentage of completion methodology is in conformity with
GAAP. The aggregate gross profit and gross profit percentage for jobs
currently in process have been estimated in good faith and in a manner such
that the aggregate gross profit and gross profit percentage achieved by the
Company upon completion should not materially adversely change from the

of jobs currently in process have been properly recognized in accordance with
GAAP. The Financial Statements contain adequate reserves for the realization
of all assets and for all reasonably anticipated liabilities in accordance
with GAAP. The Company maintains adequate internal controls to assure the
proper recording of all assets, Liabilities and transactions in the Companys
records and books of account and to safeguard the Companys assets.

reflected as owned in the books and records of the Company, including all of
the properties and assets reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet (except for
assets held under leases disclosed in Section 4.7 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and property sold since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, in the
Ordinary Course of Business), and to all of the properties and assets
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company since the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet (except for property acquired and sold since the date of the
Latest Balance Sheet). All material properties and assets reflected in the
Latest Balance Sheet are in good operating condition, subject to normal
maintenance, repair or replacement, are free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances, and are suitable in all material respects
for the purpose for which they are used or intended to be used. Each Seller is
the lawful record and beneficial owner of his, her or its Shares transferred

capital stock of the Company. Each Seller owns the Shares transferred by such

Company have arisen in the Ordinary Course of Business, represent legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations to the Company and, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, are not and will not be subject to any contests, claims,
counterclaims or setoffs other than in the Ordinary Course of Business. There
has been no material adverse change since  



 

25  July 31, 2008 in the amount or collectability of the Accounts Receivables
due the Company or the related provisions or reserves from that reflected

bankrupt.

4.9. _Inventory_. All Inventory of the Company, whether or not reflected in
the Financial Statements, consists of a quality and quantity usable and

4.11.  _Indebtedness_. Section 4.11 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets

Tax Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account all
applicable extensions). All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete.
All Taxes due and owing by the Company have been paid (whether or not shown on

responsible for Taxes of the Company expects any taxing authority to assess
any additional Taxes for any period for which a Tax Return has been filed. The
Company is not currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which
to file any Tax Return or pay any Tax. No claim has ever been made in writing
or otherwise addressed to the Company by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company does not file Tax Returns that is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. To the Knowledge of Sellers, there are no
jurisdictions in which the Company does not file Tax Returns or pay Taxes that

taxes.

of the Latest Balance Sheet, the Company has not incurred any liability for
Taxes outside the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past custom and
practice. As of the Closing Date, the unpaid Taxes of  



 

26  the Company will not exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the Latest Balance Sheet.

Disclosure Schedule, from and after December 31, 2001, no deficiencies for
Taxes against the Company have been claimed, proposed or assessed by any
taxing authority. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
Threatened audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any
liability in respect of Taxes of the Company. The Company has delivered or
made available to Buyer complete and accurate copies of federal income and
material state and local Tax Returns of each of the Company and its
predecessors for all Tax years ending on or after December 31, 2003. Neither
the Company nor any predecessor has waived any statute of limitations in
respect of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to
any Tax assessment or deficiency which has not been previously resolved.

any assets of the Company other than statutory inchoate tax liens which have
not been perfected.

local Tax provision.

(f) There are no Tax-sharing agreements or similar arrangements (including
indemnity arrangements) with respect to or involving the Company, and,
after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound by any such Tax-
sharing agreements or similar arrangements entered into prior to the Closing
or have any Liability thereunder for amounts due under any such agreements or
arrangements in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

(g) Since December 31, 2001, the Company has not been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than
a group the common parent of which is the Company). The Company has no
material Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Taxes of the
Company) (i) under Treasury regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor,
(iii) by Contract, or (iv) otherwise.

_ARTICLE 7_

_POST-CLOSING COVENANTS_

7.1. _Covenant Not to Compete_. From and after Closing, Sellers covenant and
agree as follows:

 

(a) _Acknowledgements_. Prior to the Closing, the Company conducted the
Business throughout the United States of America and had active plans to
expand into Canada and Mexico. Following the Closing, the Parties plan for the
Company to conduct the Business throughout North America and to pursue
projects in other geographic locations, including Europe, Asia, South America
and the Middle East. Sellers acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer is purchasing all of the Companys Business, including its
valuable goodwill, trade secrets, confidential business information, and
other Intellectual Property which gives the Company a competitive advantage
in its industries. Jon and Janet each have detailed personal knowledge
regarding the Companys trade secrets, confidential information, and other
Intellectual Property and the Parties agree that competition by any of the
Sellers during the Restricted Period would deprive Buyer of the benefit of its
bargain and destroy the goodwill being purchased by Buyer. In addition, Jon is
currently acting as the Companys Chief Executive Officer and President and,
after the Closing, will be employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates and will
provide executive management services both to Buyer and the Company.



 

48 (b) _Territory and Restricted Period_. As used in this ARTICLE 7, the term
"Territory", as it applies to any Seller other than Jon, means North America
and, as it applies to Jon, means North America and any other country in which
the Company provides products or services during the twelve (12) month period
immediately preceding the termination of Jons employment with the Buyer or
its Affiliates. As used in this ARTICLE 7, the term "Restricted Period", as it
applies to Jon, means the later to occur of the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date or 36 months after Jons employment with Buyer or its Affiliates
terminates and, as it applies to any other Seller, it means the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date.

(c) _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation by Jon_. In order to allow Buyer to
realize the full benefit of its bargain in connection with the purchase of
the Shares and as a material inducement to Buyer entering into this Agreement
and consummating the Contemplated Transactions, Jon will not at any time
during the Restricted Period and within the Territory, directly
or indirectly, acting alone or as a member of a partnership or as a holder of
any security or ownership interest of any class, or as an employee, consultant
to or representative of, any corporation or other business entity:

(i) engage in, continue in or carry on any business which competes with the
Business or competes with the businesses conducted by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates employing Jon after the Closing;

(ii) solicit any customers of the Company or of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates employing Jon after the Closing for purposes of offering products
or services that are directly competitive with the products or services
offered by the Company or of Buyer or its Affiliates; or

(iii) hire, offer to hire, or solicit for employment any current or former
employee of the Company, Buyer, or its Affiliates, unless such Person has
been separated from employment by the Company, Buyer or its Affiliates for at
least one year.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the passive ownership of up to five percent
(5%) of the outstanding capital stock of a company which is publicly traded
and listed on an international securities exchange shall not be deemed a
violation of the provisions of this Section 7.1. 

(d) _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation by All Sellers other than Jon_. In
order to allow Buyer to realize the full benefit of its bargain in connection
with the purchase of the Shares and as a material inducement to Buyer entering
into this Agreement and consummating the Contemplated Transactions, none of
the Sellers other than Jon will at any time during the Restricted Period and
within the Territory, directly or indirectly, acting alone or as a member of a
partnership or as a holder of any security or ownership interest of any class,
or as an employee, consultant to or representative of, any corporation or
other business entity:

(i) engage in, continue in or carry on any business which competes with
the Business;



 

49 (ii) solicit any customers of the Company for purposes of offering products or
services that are directly competitive with the products or services offered
by the Company; or

(iii) hire, offer to hire, or solicit for employment any current or former
employee of the Company unless such employee has been separated from
employment by the Company, Buyer or its Affiliates for at least one year.

(e) _Trade Secrets and Confidential Information_. All of the Sellers covenant
and agree to maintain the confidentiality of, and to not use or disclose
except as authorized by Buyer, all trade secrets of the Company, Buyer, and/or
Buyers Affiliates for as long as such information remains a trade secret. All
of the Sellers further covenant and agree, for the applicable Restricted
Period, to maintain the confidentiality of, and to not use or disclose except
as authorized by Buyer, all confidential information of the Company, Buyer,
and/or Buyers Affiliates that does not constitute a trade secret. 

(f) _Return of Materials_. Upon the termination of Jons employment with Buyer
or its Affiliates, Jon will return to Buyer all information, property,
documents, cars, computers, credit cards and other materials he received from,
or which belong to, Buyer, the Company, or any of Buyers Affiliates.

(g) _Severability; Reformation; Equitable Relief_. Sellers acknowledge and
agree that the covenants provided for in this Section 7.1 are reasonable and
necessary in terms of time, area and line of business to protect the Buyers
legitimate business interests which include its interests in protecting the
Companys valuable confidential business information, trade secrets and
goodwill. Sellers expressly authorize the enforcement of the covenants
provided for in this Section 7.1 by (i) the Buyer, (ii) the Buyers permitted
assigns, (iii) Buyers Affiliates, including the Company, and (iv) any
successors to the Buyer or its business. Sellers each covenant and agree not
to challenge the enforceability of, or raise any equitable defense to, the
covenants set forth in this Section 7.1. To the extent that any portion of
any of the covenants provided for in this Section 7.1 may later be deemed by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad to be enforced as written,
the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration or scope of the provision, and to add or delete specific words or
phrases to or from the provision, in order to give maximum legal effect to the
Parties intentions. The provision as modified shall then be enforced. 

(h) _Specific Performance_. If any Seller breaches or threatens to breach any
of the provisions of this Section 7.1, Buyer (or any other entity authorized
to enforce the provisions of Section 7.1) shall have the right and remedy, in
addition to any others that may be available, at law or in equity, to: (i)
have the provisions of this Section 7.1 specifically enforced through
injunctive or other relief, without the necessity of posting a bond, it being
acknowledged that any such breach will  



 

50  cause irreparable injury to Buyer, the amount of which will be difficult to
determine, and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to
Buyer; (ii) collect all reasonable costs of enforcement of this Agreement,
including reasonable attorneys fees and costs, from the applicable Seller(s);
and (iii) collect any quantifiable damages caused by the breach. Sellers
covenant and agree that they shall not, and shall not authorize any other
Person to, initiate any claim or lawsuit (whether by way of a declaratory
action or otherwise) seeking to challenge or question the enforceability of
any provision of this Section 7.1.

7.2. _No Disparagement_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, none of Sellers nor any of their
respective Related Persons or Representatives shall, in any way to any Person
or Governmental Body, denigrate or derogate the Company, Buyer or any of their
Affiliates or Related Persons (collectively, the "Buyer Group"), or any
product or service or procedure of any of the foregoing. A statement shall be
deemed denigrating or derogatory to any Person if it adversely affects the
regard or esteem in which such Person is held by customers, investors, lenders
or licensing, rating, or regulatory entities. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, none of Sellers nor any of their respective Related Persons
or Representatives shall, directly or indirectly in any way in respect of any
member of the Buyer Group communicate with, or take any action which is
adverse to the position of any such member of the Buyer Group with any Person
or Governmental Body who or which has dealings or prospective dealings with
any such member of the Buyer Group or jurisdiction or prospective jurisdiction
over any such member of the Buyer Group. In addition, none of Sellers nor any
of their respective Related Persons or Representatives shall take any action
that foreseeably could damage or diminish the goodwill or reputation of any

claim or action arising under this Agreement.

jurisdiction or prospective jurisdiction over any such member of the Seller
Group. In addition, neither Buyer, Guarantor nor any of their respective
Related Persons or Representatives shall take any action that foreseeably

51 7.3. _Certain Tax Matters_.

(a) The Buyer shall include the Company in its consolidated Tax group
effective as of the day following the Closing Date, thereby causing the Tax
year of the Company for federal and to the extent applicable, state and local
income Tax purposes to end on the Closing Date. The Buyer shall be responsible
for preparing and filing, or causing the Company to prepare and file, all
Tax Returns of the Company for the taxable periods ending after the Closing
Date, including Straddle Periods, and the Sellers shall be responsible for
preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date. Any Tax Return for the period ending on the
Closing Date ("Stub Period Return") or a period ending prior to the Closing
Date ("Pre-Closing Period Return") shall be furnished to the Buyer for
its review, comment and approval at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (or extended due date) for filing such Tax Returns and such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with past practice, except as required by
Legal Requirement. The Sellers shall make changes as reasonably requested by
the Buyer, and shall not file such Tax Returns without Buyers consent, not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Sellers shall pay all
Taxes required to be paid with respect to such Tax Returns less the Actual
Tax Obligations included in the Final Closing Adjustment. The Buyer shall
cooperate fully in connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax
Returns. The Sellers shall not amend any such Tax Returns without the prior
written consent of the Buyer, not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld.

(b) If a Party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section
11.5(a) (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") and a Party which is not responsible
for the payment of such Taxes pursuant to Section 11.5(a) (the "Tax
Indemnified Party") receives notice of any deficiency, proposed adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a "Tax Claim")
with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party will notify (and, in
any event, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice of any such Tax
Claim) the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim, but the
failure to so notify the Tax Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Tax
Indemnifying Party of any Liability it may have to the Tax Indemnified Party,
except to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice
thereby.

(c) With respect to any Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party may assume and
control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without
limiting the foregoing, may pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any applicable
governmental Persons with respect thereto, and may, either pay the Tax claimed
and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest
the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that the Tax
Indemnifying Party will consult with the Tax Indemnified Party in the
negotiation and settlement of any Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnifying Party
will not, without the written consent of the Tax Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld, settle or
compromise any Tax Claim in any manner if such settlement or compromise would
have the effect of increasing the Taxes of the Tax Indemnified Party
("Indemnified Party Tax Increase"); provided, that, to the extent that a Tax
Claim relates to the Straddle Period, the Sellers Representative and the
Buyer will jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any such
Tax Claim.



 

52 (d) The Tax Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party
in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation will include the retention and
(upon the Tax Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Tax
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

(e) No Party will settle or compromise a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of
the Company for a Straddle Period without the other Partys or Parties
written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned
or withheld.

7.4. _Further Assurances_. The Parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to
each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the
other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent
of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

7.5.  _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as Buyer or Company
is actively contesting or defending against any litigation or claim in
connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act
or transaction existing or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date involving
the Company or the Business, Sellers will cooperate in the contest or defense
and provide such testimony as may be reasonably necessary in connection with
the contest or defense, at the cost and expense of Buyer (unless and to the
extent Buyer is entitled to indemnification therefor hereunder, in which event
such costs and expenses shall be borne by Sellers).

provided in ARTICLE 1, this Section 10.2 and ARTICLE 12, which shall survive
such termination; provided, however, that except to the extent set forth in
this Section 10.2, nothing herein shall relieve any party from Liability for
any Breach of this Agreement.



 

57 (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(a), Section

the Sellers Representative, the Company and all of their Affiliates and
Related Persons against Buyer, Guarantor and all of their Affiliates and
Related Persons for any and all Adverse Consequences suffered as a result
thereof or otherwise in connection with this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages
and not a penalty and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for recovery by

Buyers right to pursue all legal remedies against Sellers and the Company
will survive such termination unimpaired. For purposes of clarity, in the
event of such a termination the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Termination Fee shall not be deemed to be a measure of damages that would
result from such a breach and agree that at no time shall they argue or in
any way assert in any proceeding relating hereto or otherwise, that the
Termination Fee is a measure of the damages resulting from such a breach.

(e) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(f) In no event, if the Closing does not occur, whether or not this Agreement

any or all Adverse Consequences relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including breaches by
Buyer of any representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations
contained in this Agreement, and in no event shall Sellers, the Sellers
Representative, the Company or any of their Affiliates or Related Persons seek
equitable relief or seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount
from Buyer, Guarantor or any of their Affiliates or Related Persons.



 

58 (g) The Sellers, the Company and the Sellers Representative each acknowledge
and agree that if the Closing does not occur, whether or not this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to any provision hereof, they shall not nor shall
any of their Affiliates or Related Persons be entitled to specific
performance, injunction or any other equitable remedy which would compel or
require Buyer, Guarantor or any of their Affiliates or Related Persons to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to pay any amount in excess
of the Termination Fee. For purposes of clarity, the right to specific
performance pursuant to Section 12.18 of this Agreement shall only be
available to Buyer and not Sellers, the Sellers Representative or any of
their Affiliates or Related Persons and Sellers agree that the Termination
Fee shall be their sole and exclusive remedy for any breach by Buyer.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, only one
Termination Fee would ever be payable under this Agreement by Buyer and
Guarantor.

(i) "Termination Fee" means the sum of (i) $10,750,000, _plus_ (ii) the
lesser of (A) Sellers and the Companys reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel, accountants, consultants, financial advisers and investment bankers
(the fees and expenses of the investment bankers to be an amount determined as
if the Closing occurred) of the Sellers and the Company) and (B) $4,000,000.

period (i.e., the parties hereto shall "close the books" on such date) and
shall elect to do so if permitted by applicable Legal Requirement; and

(ii) the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be, (A) in the case of Taxes
based on income or receipts determined under the closing of the books method
and (b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may
be deducted from or offset against such Taxes with respect to such periods
under the relevant Tax Legal Requirement) (or in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any
credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period
shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this Section 11.5(b)(ii).



 

62 11.6. _Procedure for Indemnification_. Subject to the other terms of this
ARTICLE 11: 

(a) _Notice of Indemnifiable Loss_. In the event that a Person entitled to
indemnification under this ARTICLE 11 (the "Indemnified Party") shall suffer
any Adverse Consequences in respect of which indemnification may be sought
under this ARTICLE 11 against the party required to provide indemnification
under this ARTICLE 11 (the "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party must
assert a claim for indemnification within the applicable Survival Period by a
written notice which contains reasonably sufficient detail and information of
the Indemnifiable Losses as then known (the "Notice of Indemnifiable Loss")
to the Indemnified Party. The Notice of Indemnifiable Loss must be provided to
the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30
days after the Indemnified Party acquires knowledge of the basis for the
claim for indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure to
provide the Indemnifying Party with a Notice of Indemnifiable Loss in such a
timely manner shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE 11 except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the Indemnified
Partys failure to give such Notice of Indemnifiable Loss in such a timely
manner.

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

(i) In the event that any third party (including any Governmental Body)
asserts a claim against an Indemnified Party for which such Indemnified Party
intends to seek indemnity from the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand and
the amount thereof, if known, or an estimate thereof, if reasonably
capable of estimation (the "Claim Notice"), but any failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE 11 except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to
give such notice.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the
Claim Notice to undertake, conduct and control the defense of such third party
claim; provided, that pending the Indemnifying Partys decision whether to
exercise its right to undertake the conduct and control of the settlement or
defense of any third party claim, the Indemnified Party shall undertake,
conduct and control the settlement or defense thereof, through counsel of its
own choosing if the failure to so act during such period might reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Party, and
provided further that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party,
in writing, within such 30 days that the Indemnifying Party will assume
the defense of the third party claim and pay all reasonable attorneys fees
and other third party defense costs in connection therewith.



 

63 (iii) All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending
such third party claim shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, at its sole cost and
expense. So long as the Indemnifying Party is defending such third party
claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim and any
settlement in violation of this restriction shall nullify and make void and
unenforceable the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such third party claim; provided, that in such event it
shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party.

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30
days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys Claim Notice that it elects
to undertake the settlement or defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to conduct and control the defense thereof and to contest,
settle or compromise the third party claim but shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.

(v) The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
third party claim unless: (x) such settlement or judgment includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such
claim to all Indemnified Parties an unconditional release from all Liability
with respect to such claim, (y) the relief provided in connection with such
settlement or judgment effected by the Indemnifying Party is satisfied
entirely by the Indemnifying Party, and (z) such settlement or judgment does
not otherwise affect any Indemnified Party or require any relief other than
monetary damages. To the extent the Indemnifying Party shall control
or participate in the defense or settlement of any third party claim or
demand, the Indemnified Party will give to the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel access to, during normal business hours, the relevant books and
records, and shall permit them to consult with the employees and counsel of
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and expense,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the defense of all
such claims.

(c) _Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities_. In the event that any Buyer
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification with respect to any
Environmental, Health and Safety Liability pursuant to Section 11.2, the Sellers
shall be entitled to control any Remedial Action or Proceeding related to such
Liability (to the extent that Sellers provide the notices and otherwise
comply with Section 11.6(b) with respect to the assumption or control of such
Remedial Action or Proceeding), with consultants, advisors and other
representatives including legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer;
provided, that, Sellers shall not be entitled to settle, compromise, or offer
to settle or compromise any such claim if such settlement, compromise or offer
to settle or compromise would not be permitted pursuant to Section
11.6(b)(v).



 

64 11.7. _Insurance and Other Sources of Reimbursement_. The amount of any
Adverse Consequences for which indemnification is provided under this ARTICLE
11 shall be reduced by (i) the insurance proceeds received with respect to any
such Adverse Consequence and (ii) any other amount, if any, recovered from
third parties (as a result of indemnification, contribution, guarantee or
otherwise) by the Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) with respect to any
Adverse Consequences less in the case of (i) and (ii) all reasonable costs of
the Indemnified Party to collect such proceeds and any premium increases with
respect to such policies as a result of such claims. If any Indemnified Party
shall have been indemnified in full pursuant to this ARTICLE 11 with respect
to any Adverse Consequence (without reduction for insurance or other
proceeds), such Indemnified Party shall, upon written request by the
Indemnifying Party, assign to such Indemnifying Party (to the extent of any
indemnification payment received by the Indemnified Party) any claim which
such Indemnified Party may have under any applicable insurance policy or other
Contract which provides coverage for such Adverse Consequence to the extent of
such indemnification payment. Such Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) to collect under such
insurance policy or other Contract. If any Indemnified Party shall have
received any indemnification payment from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this ARTICLE 11 with respect to any Adverse Consequence and the Indemnified
Party has been indemnified in full with respect to such Adverse Consequence
(after application or other insurance proceeds as set forth in the first
sentence of this paragraph) and has or shall subsequently have received
insurance proceeds or other amounts with respect to such Adverse Consequence,
which when added together with all other insurance (less all reasonable costs
of collection and any premium increases) and other proceeds and
indemnification amounts received is in excess of the amount of the Adverse
Consequence (without reduction for insurance or other proceeds), then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party such
excess, but not in excess of the amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party.

11.8. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Payments received by any Party pursuant
to this ARTICLE 11 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

_ARTICLE 12_

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

12.1.  _Expenses_. Subject to Section 10.2(b), each of the Buyer and the
Sellers will bear their respective fees and expenses relating to the
Contemplated Transactions. The Sellers will bear all fees and expenses of the
Company related to the Contemplated Transactions.

12.2. _Public Announcements_. Except as required by Legal Requirements or by
any obligations pursuant to any listing agreement or rules of any national

to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions will be issued, if at all,
at such time and in such manner as determined by Buyer and Sellers. Sellers,

the Company to maintain in confidence, any written, oral, or other information
obtained in confidence from another party or the Company in connection with
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, unless (a) such information
is already known to such party or to others not bound by a duty of

use of such information is required by legal proceedings, (d) the use of such

request.

under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly

12.5. _Sellers  Representative_.

(a) _Appointment_. "Sellers Representative" means Jon L. Wanzek provided,
that in the event of his death, resignation or physical or mental incapacity
to act as Sellers Representative, "Sellers Representative" shall mean Kevin
Gourde. Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Sellers
Representative as such Sellers attorney-in-fact and agent to act in such
Sellers name, place and stead in connection with all matters arising from and
under this Agreement, and the Escrow Agreement and acknowledges that such
appointment is coupled with an interest. Sellers Representative hereby
accepts such appointment and authorization.

(b) _Authority_. Each Seller agrees to be bound by all notices received or
given by, and all agreements and determinations made by, and all documents
executed and delivered by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement;
authorizes the Sellers Representative to assert claims, make demands and
commence actions on behalf of Sellers under this Agreement, dispute or to
refrain from disputing any claim made by Sellers, negotiate and compromise any
dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising
remedies available to Sellers under, this Agreement, and to sign any releases
or other documents with respect to such dispute or remedy (and to bind Sellers
in so doing), give such instructions and do such other things and refrain
from doing such things as the Sellers Representative shall deem appropriate
to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, give any and all consents and
notices under this Agreement, and perform all actions, exercise all powers,
and fulfill all duties otherwise assigned to the Sellers Representative in
this Agreement. Each of the Sellers hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees
that the Sellers Representative has the sole and exclusive authority to act
on such Sellers behalf in respect of all matters arising under or in
connection with this Agreement after execution of this Agreement,
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among them, and that no Seller
shall have any authority to act unilaterally or independently of the Sellers
Representative in respect to any such matter. Buyer, the Company (after the
Closing) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions
taken by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement, and the Escrow
Agreement without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of
Sellers. All notices, counter notices or other instruments or designations
delivered by any Seller in regard to this Agreement shall not be effective
unless, but shall be effective if, signed by the Sellers Representative, and
if not, such document shall have no force or effect whatsoever and Buyer, the
Company (after the Closing), the Escrow Agent and any other Person may
proceed without regard to any such document.



 

67 12.6. _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules attached
hereto and referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part
of this Agreement for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Except as
expressly set forth on the attached Disclosure Schedules, the definitions
contained in the Agreement are incorporated therein by reference. The
disclosures in the Disclosure Schedules, and those in any supplement thereto,
will be set forth with respect to the representations and warranties in the
Section of the Agreement to which they relate provided, that any disclosure
made with respect to any particular Section of this Agreement shall be deemed
a disclosure with respect to any other Section of this Agreement if the
application of such disclosure to such other Section is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure. In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Schedules
(other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure
Schedules with respect to a specifically identified representation or
warranty), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

12.7.  _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF FLORIDA OTHER THAN CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF DIRECTING THE
APPLICATION OF ANY LAW OTHER THAN THAT OF FLORIDA. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
SECTION 7.1(G), COURTS WITHIN THE STATE OF FLORIDA (LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTY
OF MIAMI-DADE) WILL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE
PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO
THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES, AND AGREES NOT TO
ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (A) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS; (B) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYS PROPERTY IS
IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS; OR (C) ANY
LITIGATION COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

12.8. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION OR
AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

12.9. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in ARTICLE 11,
nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or
by reason of this Agreement, such third parties specifically including
employees and creditors of the Company.



 

68 12.10. _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any
party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege.

12.11. _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior and contemporaneous agreements between the Parties with respect to its
subject matter and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this
Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not
be amended except by a written instrument signed by Buyer and Sellers.

12.12. _Assignments and Successors_. No Party may assign any of its rights
under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other Parties, except
that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any Subsidiary
of Buyer or any lender to Buyer; provided, however, that no such
assignment by Buyer shall release or relieve Buyer of any obligation or
liability hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the
successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

12.13. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

12.14. _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. In this Agreement, except
to the extent otherwise provided or that the context otherwise requires: (a)
when a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Paragraph,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference is to an Article or Section or Paragraph
of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated;
the Exhibits and Schedules form part of and shall have effect as if set out in
this Agreement and any reference to this "Agreement" includes the Exhibits and
the Schedules; (b) the table of contents and headings for this Agreement, are
for reference purposes only and do not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement; (c) whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they are
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (d) the words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in
this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement; (e) all terms defined in this Agreement have the
defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto, unless otherwise defined therein; (f) the terms
defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when used in the
plural, and vice versa; (g) references to a Person are also to its successors
and  



 

69  permitted assigns; (h) the use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive
unless expressly indicated otherwise; (i) the term "Dollars" or "$" shall
refer to the currency of the United States of America; and (j) all references
to time, except as set forth in Section 3.1, shall refer to Central Standard
Time. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement and the agreements and instruments to be delivered pursuant
hereto. This Agreement and such agreements and instruments shall not be
construed for or against any Party by reason of the authorship of any
provision hereof or by reason of the status of the respective Parties.

12.15. _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. The Parties
acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by the other
of its obligations hereunder as a material inducement to enter into this
Agreement.

12.16. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile and electronic transmission), each of
which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.

12.17. _Limited Guarantee_. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
absolutely guarantees the full and punctual payment of all
payment obligations of Buyer before, after and at the Closing; provided, that
if the Closing does not occur, under all circumstances Guarantors Liability
hereunder shall be limited to the Termination Fee, to the extent unpaid by
Buyer.

12.18. _Specific Performance_. Buyer shall have the right and remedy, in
addition to any others that may be available, at law or in equity, to have
the provisions of this Agreement specifically enforced through injunctive or
other relief, without the necessity of posting a bond, it being acknowledged
that the Company is a unique asset, with value to Buyers business not
readily quantifiable and any breach by Sellers and/or the Company which
causes the Closing not to occur will cause irreparable injury to Buyer, the
amount of which will be difficult to determine, and that money damages will
not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer. Sellers, the Company and Sellers
Representative covenant and agree that they shall not, and shall not authorize
any other Person to, challenge or question the enforceability of any provision
of this Section 12.18.

12.19. _Attorneys  Fees_. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the attorneys fees, costs
and necessary disbursements of the Parties shall be apportioned between the
Parties based on the degree to which each Partys claims were unsuccessful.
