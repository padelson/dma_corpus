America and the Middle East. Sellers acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer is purchasing all of the Company&#146;s Business, including its valuable goodwill, trade secrets, confidential business information, and other

the Parties agree that competition by any of the Sellers during the Restricted Period would deprive Buyer of the benefit of its bargain and destroy the goodwill being purchased by Buyer. In addition, Jon is currently acting as the Company&#146;s
Chief Executive Officer and President and, after the Closing, will be employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates and will provide executive management services both to Buyer and the Company. </FONT></P> <P
