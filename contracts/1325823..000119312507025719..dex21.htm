This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of February 8, 2007 by and among Oakmont Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _Oakmont_ "), OAKMONT KANSAS, INC., a Kansas
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oakmont (" _New Oakmont_ "),
BROOKE CREDIT CORPORATION, a Kansas corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
BROOKE CORPORATION, a Kansas corporation and majority stockholder of the

R E C I T A L S

Boards of Directors of Oakmont and New Oakmont intend to cause Oakmont to
merge with and into New Oakmont (the " _Reincorporation Merger_ ").

B. Oakmont, New Oakmont, Parent and the Company desire to enter this
Agreement pursuant to which, following the Reincorporation Merger, the Company
will merge with and into New Oakmont.

C. The Boards of Directors of Oakmont, New Oakmont, Parent and the Company
have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests
of Oakmont, New Oakmont, Parent and the Company, and their respective
stockholders, that the Company be merged with and into New Oakmont.

D. The Boards of Directors of Oakmont, New Oakmont, Parent and the Company
have each unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

E. The Boards of Directors of Oakmont, New Oakmont and the Company have agreed
to recommend that their respective stockholders adopt and approve this
Agreement.

F. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that these proposed
transactions, individually and collectively, shall qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (" _Code_ "), and this Agreement shall constitute a
plan of reorganization pursuant to Section 368 of the Code.

A G R E E M E N T

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the respective
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:

1\. MERGER.

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein and the applicable provisions of the KGCL, and on the basis of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, as of
the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into New Oakmont (the
" _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence  



 

1  of the Company shall cease and New Oakmont shall continue as the surviving
corporation. New Oakmont, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, may
be hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

1.2. _Filing of Certificates of Merger_. Subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the Company and New Oakmont shall as soon as possible on the Closing
Date or such other date as New Oakmont and Parent shall agree, cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State
of Kansas a duly executed Certificate of Merger in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Oakmont and Parent.

1.3. _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided herein and the applicable provisions of the KGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all of the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and New Oakmont shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation and all of the debts, liabilities, duties and
obligations of the Company and New Oakmont shall become the debts,
liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation. 

1.4. _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by New
Oakmont to Parent and any other holder of capital stock of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") in
the Merger (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") shall be the number of shares of
common stock of New Oakmont, $0.01 par value per share (the " _New Oakmont
Stock_ ") equal to (a) the Closing Payment, _plus_ (b) the Earnout Payments,
if any, determined and paid as set forth in this Article 1.

1.5. _Effect on Stock_. Upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and this Agreement and without
the need for any further action on the part of New Oakmont, the Company or any
of their respective stockholders, the following shall occur:

1.5.(a) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Each share of the issued and
outstanding common stock of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Per Share Consideration. Until
properly delivered to New Oakmont or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
Section 1.9, any certificate evidencing shares of common stock of the
Company (a " _Certificate_ ") shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence
only the right to receive the consideration described in this Section 1.5(a).

1.5.(b) _Conversion of New Oakmont Stock_. Each share of the issued and
outstanding common stock of New Oakmont immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically converted into one (1) share of the validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable authorized common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate evidencing the common stock of New
Oakmont shall evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.6. _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall assume and cause to be performed all obligations of the Company under
the Company Warrants. Each Company Warrant so assumed by the Surviving
Corporation under this  



 

2  Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable warrant agreement immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that each outstanding Company Warrant will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms), for
shares of New Oakmont common stock in the same proportion that the Company
Stockholders receive in the aggregate for their shares in the Merger
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of the Closing Payment and
each Earnout Payment, if any).

1.7. _Organizational Documents_. As of the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of New Oakmont, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall become the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Article I of the
Articles of Incorporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is Brooke Credit Corporation".

1.8. _Officers and Directors_. As of the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of New Oakmont shall become the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and, subject to Section 9.3(f), shall serve as such
until the expiration of their term of office or their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

1.9. _Exchange of Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by New Oakmont, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and the Certificate
so surrendered shall be canceled.

1.10. _Earnout Payments_.

1.10.(a) The Merger Consideration shall include, if earned, up to two
additional payments (each, an " _Earnout Payment_ ", and collectively, the "
_Earnout Payments_ ") based upon the Surviving Corporations Adjusted Earnings
as follows:

(i) _Fiscal Year 2007_. Subject to the Surviving Corporations achievement of
Adjusted Earnings of at least $15,000,000 for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2007, the Merger Consideration shall include the First Earnout Shares.

(ii) _Fiscal Year 2008_. Subject to the Surviving Corporations achievement of
Adjusted Earnings of at least $19,000,000 for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2008, the Merger Consideration shall include the Second Earnout Shares.

1.10.(b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain separate books and records,
including but not limited to, balance sheets and related statements of income
and cash flows, so as to make calculation of Adjusted Earnings feasible and
verifiable.



 

3 1.10.(c) As soon as practicable and in any event within 90 days after December
31 of 2007 and 2008, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to Parent a
statement of the Adjusted Earnings of the Surviving Corporation for the
applicable period (the " _Earnout Statement_ "), as verified by the Surviving
Corporations independent auditors and reasonably approved by both Oakmont
Directors. The Surviving Corporation shall provide to Parent and its
representatives copies of such records and work papers created in connection
with preparation of the Earnout Statement as are reasonably requested to
support such Earnout Statement. Parent and its representatives shall have the
right to inspect the Surviving Corporations books and records during business
hours upon reasonable prior notice and solely for purposes reasonably related
to the determination of Adjusted Earnings.

1.10.(d) Upon receipt of each such Earnout Statement, Parent shall be
entitled to object to the calculation of Adjusted Earnings by delivery to the
Surviving Corporation of a notice of objections thereto (a " _Notice of
Objection_ "), in reasonable detail describing the nature of the disagreement
asserted. If Parent fails to deliver a Notice of Objection to the Surviving
Corporation within twenty (20) days following receipt of the Earnout
Statement, the determination of Adjusted Earnings by the Surviving
Corporation as set forth in the Earnout Statement shall be final and binding
on the parties hereto. If Parent and the Surviving Corporation are unable to
reconcile their differences in writing within twenty (20) days after a Notice
of Objection is delivered by Parent, the Independent Accountants shall be
selected and the items in dispute shall be submitted to the Independent
Accountants within ten (10) days thereafter. The determination of Independent
Accountants shall be set forth in writing and shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties, and the fees, costs and expenses of such Independent
Accountants shall be paid by the non-prevailing party. The Independent
Accountants shall consider only the items in dispute and shall be instructed
to act within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as Parent and the
Surviving Corporation may agree) to resolve all items in dispute. If Parent in
its discretion gives written notification of its acceptance of an
Earnout Statement prior to the end of such 30-day period, such Earnout
Statement shall thereupon become binding, final and conclusive upon all the
parties hereto.

1.11. No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of New Oakmont Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of the Company exchanged for shares of New Oakmont Stock
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of New Oakmont Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of
New Oakmont Stock multiplied by $6.00.

1.12. Further Action. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company, the directors and officers of the  



 

4  Company and New Oakmont are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

2\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND COMPANY.

Parent and the Company, jointly and severally, make the following
representations and warranties to Oakmont and New Oakmont, subject to the
exceptions set forth in the disclosure schedule attached hereto (the "
_Disclosure Schedule_ ").

2.1. _Corporate_.

2.1.(a) _Organization_. Each of Parent and the Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Kansas.

2.1.(b) _Corporate Power_. The Company has all requisite power and authority
to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as and
where such is now being conducted. Each of Parent and the Company has all
requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the other
documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto,
to perform its obligations hereunder, and to carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

2.1.(c) _Qualification_. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do
business as a foreign company, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
wherein the character of the properties owned or leased by it, or the nature
of its business, makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except for
such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and would not materially delay the Closing
or materially and adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

2.1.(d)  _No Subsidiaries_. Except as set forth in Section 2.1(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
voting securities or other equity interests in, or have the right to control,
any other Person. 

2.2. _Authority_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by
Parent and the Company pursuant hereto and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary parties. No other or further act or proceeding on the part of Parent
or the Company is necessary to authorize this Agreement or the other
documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by Parent or the
Company pursuant hereto or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. This Agreement constitutes, and when executed and
delivered, the other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by
Parent and the Company pursuant hereto will constitute, legal, valid and
binding agreements of Parent and the Company, enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,  



 

5  moratorium or similar Laws relating to or limiting creditors rights
generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.

2.3. _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of

undesignated preferred stock of which no shares are issued and outstanding.
All of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were
issued in compliance with all applicable Laws. Section 2.3 of the Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list of each stockholder of the
Company and the number of shares held by each. Except as set forth in Section
2.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding subscription, option,
warrant, call rights, preemptive rights or other agreements or commitments
obligating the Company to issue, sell, deliver or transfer (including any
rights of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security or other
instrument) any economic, voting, ownership or any other type of interest or
security in the Company.

2.4. _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or

the Closing. Oakmont acknowledges that the Parent owns a savings bank that may
make occasional loans to insurance agencies, insurance companies, or other
insurance related businesses including funeral homes. Therefore, "Materially
Competes" means to own or operate a finance company that specializes in making
loans to insurance agencies, insurance companies or insurance related
businesses including funeral homes; provided however, that Parent and its
Affiliates may directly or indirectly (i) make such loans on a incidental or
occasional basis so long as the Parent and Affiliates do not specifically
promote or advertise that they make such loans; and (ii) make commission
advance loans to Brooke Franchise Corporation franchisees.



 

28 4.9.(b) For period of one (1) year following the Closing, Parent shall not,
directly or indirectly, solicit (other than solicitations published in a
journal or newspaper or other publication or general circulation) for
employment any person who was an Employee except (i) with the prior consent of
the Surviving Corporation, or (ii) if such Person has not been employed by
the Surviving Corporation for a period of at least six months prior to such
solicitation.

4.9.(c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that compliance with the covenants
contained in this Section 4.9 is necessary to protect the value of the
goodwill being acquired by the Surviving Corporation and that these covenants
are reasonable for such purposes. If any provision contained in this Section
4.9 shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Section 4.9, but this Section 4.9 shall be construed
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained in this Section 4.9 is held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extant
invalid, such provision shall be construed to be null, void and of no effect,
but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret
or reform this Section 4.9 to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such
applicable Law.

4.9.(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to (i) seek
injunctive relief requiring specific performance by Parent of this Section 4.9
without the necessity of proving actual Damages or the posting of a bond and
(ii) seek from time to time any other remedies available under applicable Law
against Parent if Parent is directly or indirectly in breach of or has
breached this Section 4.9.

4.10.  _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_. For a period of not less
than six (6) years after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the officers, directors, employees and
agents of Oakmont, the Company and the Parent to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law against Damages arising out of claims brought or made by
third parties based on the actions of such persons in their capacities as
officers, directors, employees or agents of Oakmont or the Company prior to
the Closing, and (ii) maintain in full force and effect and honor, all
obligations to indemnify the officers, directors, employees and agents of
Oakmont and the Company and to advance expenses existing in favor of such
persons in effect as of the Closing Date under applicable law or as provided
in the Organizational Documents of Oakmont or the Company, as the case may be.

4.11. _Company Name and Principal Office_. Oakmont, Parent and the Company
agree that after the Closing the Surviving Corporation shall continue
to conduct business under the name "Brooke Credit Corporation" with a
principal office in Overland Park, Kansas.

specify in reasonable detail all facts and circumstances known to the
Indemnified Party regarding the claim and shall explain in reasonable detail
the basis on which the Indemnified Party claims a right to indemnity,
including citation to relevant sections of this Agreement, and, if estimable,
shall estimate the amount of the liability arising therefrom. The failure to
provide such notice shall not result in a waiver of any right to

39  case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of
any claim against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to settle any claim for which indemnification has been sought and is
available hereunder; provided that, to the extent that such settlement
requires the Indemnified Party to take, or prohibits the Indemnified Party
from taking, any action or purports to obligate the Indemnified Party, then
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle such claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense of a third party claim and disputes the Indemnified Partys right
to indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume
control of the defense of such claim through counsel of its choice, the
reasonable costs of which shall be at the Indemnifying Partys expense in the
event that the Indemnified Partys right of indemnification is
ultimately established through settlement, compromise or other legal
proceeding. In no circumstance may the Indemnified Party compromise or settle
a claim with a third party for which it seeks indemnification from the
Indemnifying Party without first obtaining the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

10.3.  _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation under applicable law and for the provisions of Section 10.2
and _Article 11_ , the indemnification provided in this _Article 10_ will
constitute the exclusive remedy of Oakmont Indemnified Parties or Parent
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and their respective assigns from and
against any and all Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
incurred or suffered by, any of them, directly or indirectly, as a result of,
or based upon or arising from the breach of any representation or warranty or
the non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant in or pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement, document, or instrument required hereunder.
Oakmont and Parent each hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims, and causes of action it may have
against any other party, or any of such other partys Affiliates, to the
contrary.

11\. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

11.1. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedule hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement, sets forth the
entire agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter
hereof, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, written
or oral, between the parties or any of their respective Affiliates with
respect to such subject matter.

11.2. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted
according to the internal laws of the State of Kansas, excluding any
choice of law rules that may direct the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction. The parties hereby stipulate that any action or other legal
proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement may be commenced
and prosecuted in its entirety in the federal or state courts having
jurisdiction over Johnson County, Kansas, each party hereby submitting to the
personal jurisdiction thereof, and the parties agree not to raise the
objection that such courts are  



 

40  not a convenient forum. Process and pleadings mailed to a party at the
address provided in Section 11.9 shall be deemed properly served and accepted
for all purposes.

11.3. _Schedules_. Information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule
specifically refers to the article and section of this Agreement to which
such information is responsive. The disclosures in any section or subsection
of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify other sections and subsections of
this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of the
matter disclosed that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections and
subsections.

11.4. _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented,
modified and/or rescinded only through an express written instrument signed by
all parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any party
may specifically and expressly waive in writing any portion of this Agreement
or any breach hereof, but only to the extent such provision is for the benefit
of the waiving party, and no such waiver shall constitute a further or
continuing waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any
other provision. The consent by one party to any act for which such consent
was required shall not be deemed to imply consent or waiver of the necessity
of obtaining such consent for the same or similar acts in the future, and no
forbearance by a party to seek a remedy for noncompliance or breach by
another party shall be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy with
respect to such noncompliance or breach.

11.5. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any interest herein shall be
assignable (voluntarily, involuntarily, by judicial process, operation of Law
or otherwise), in whole or in part, by any party without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be null
and void.

11.6. _Successors and Assigns_. Each of the terms, provisions and obligations
of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by the parties and their respective legal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns. 

11.7. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as giving any
Person, other than the parties to this Agreement and their successors and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under, or in respect of, this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

11.8. _No Personal Liability_. This Agreement shall not create or be deemed to
create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of (a) any
direct or indirect stockholder of Parent or Oakmont, or (b) any officer,
director, employee, agent or representative of Parent, Oakmont, the Company or

11.10. _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the
provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible

Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is

of such provision affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction.

an originally executed signature page is required by Law) may be executed by
delivery of a facsimile copy of an executed signature page with the same force
and effect as the delivery of an originally executed signature page. In the
event any party delivers a facsimile copy of a signature page to this
Agreement or any other document or agreement executed in connection herewith,
such party shall deliver an originally executed signature page within three
business days of delivering such facsimile signature page or at any time
thereafter upon request; provided, however, that the failure to deliver any
such originally executed signature page shall not affect the validity of the
signature page delivered by facsimile, which has and shall continue to have
the same force and effect as the originally executed signature page.

incurred on behalf of Parent and the Company in connection with the
