incorporation and bylaws, or similar organization documents, of the Surviving Corporation and of
each of its Subsidiaries concerning elimination of liability and indemnification of directors and
officers shall not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any Person that is as of the date of this Agreement an officer or director of the Company or of any
such Subsidiary except as may be required by applicable Law. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety
for, and shall cause the Company to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the

Date, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Person who is a current or former officer
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against all losses and expenses (including
all losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, settlement payments, awards, judgments, fines,
penalties, damages (including compensatory, punitive and consequential damages), demands, claims,
actions, causes of action, assessments, deficiencies and other charges and attorneys&#146; fees) arising
out of or pertaining to acts or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) by them in their
capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred at or prior to Closing. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, the indemnification and related rights hereunder shall be mandatory
rather than permissive, and Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance expenses
in connection with such indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
provided that, to the extent required by Law, the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification and provided further that neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable for any
losses or expenses arising out of (i)&nbsp;any Action initiated by the indemnified Person or (ii)&nbsp;any
settlement effected without its prior written consent. At Closing, Parent shall assume and become
liable for, jointly and severally with the Surviving Corporation and each such Subsidiary, any
liability and all obligations of the Company and each such Subsidiary under such provisions.

Time the current policies of directors&#146; and officers&#146; fiduciary and liability insurance maintained
by the Company by purchasing a policy providing &#147;tail&#148; coverage for a period of not less than six
years from the Effective Time with a carrier (or carriers) and in a form reasonably agreed upon by
Company. Parent shall make available to Company evidence of said coverage immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however that Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
not, in the aggregate, be required to pay a premium in excess of 250% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the &#147;<B>Cap</B>&#148;) in order to purchase such
policy; and provided, further, that if tail coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by
paying an annual premium in excess of the Cap, then Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to purchase a policy or maintain policies that, in Parent&#146;s good faith
judgment, provides as much comparable insurance as is available at an aggregate premium equal to

shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.
