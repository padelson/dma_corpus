 (d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law.

 (e) _Lost Documents_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount of cash contemplated pursuant to Section 2.7(a) or Section 2.8, as the case may be. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Restricted Stock and Deferred Units such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign tax Law.

With respect to the Foreign Plans: (i) all required contributions have been made in accordance with applicable local statutory requirements or accrued to the extent required by applicable local statutory requirements; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the Liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual or contingent) accrued to the closing date (i.e. on an "accrued benefit obligation" basis as is defined in SFAS 87 or equivalent under local generally accepted accounting principles) with respect to all current and former participants under such Foreign Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Plan, and none of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations or book reserves to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) there is no Liability with respect to any Foreign Plan which will result by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 3.11(d) is subject to exception as set forth in Section 3.11(d) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Company Plan provides medical or other welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former employees for periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of employment, other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or as mandated by applicable Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination. There is no material pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, litigation relating to the Plans. 

  

 (f) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Except as specifically disclosed in Section 3.11(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (alone or together with other events) neither result in or entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance

benefits or any other payment under any Company Plan nor result in an excise
tax imposed on any Person under Section 4999 of the Code or cause any amounts

tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. 

   

 (g) With respect to each of the Plans, all material contributions or premium payments due and payable on or before Closing have been timely made, and to the extent not presently payable, appropriate reserves have been established for the payment and properly accrued and reflected in the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.

 (a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or similar organization documents, of the Surviving Corporation and of each of its Subsidiaries concerning elimination of liability and indemnification of directors and officers shall not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person that is as of the date of this Agreement an officer or director of the Company or of any such Subsidiary except as may be required by applicable Law. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Company to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.7. In addition to the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Person who is a current or former officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against all losses and expenses (including all losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, settlement payments, awards, judgments, fines, penalties, damages (including compensatory, punitive and consequential damages), demands, claims, actions, causes of action, assessments, deficiencies and other charges and attorneys fees) arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) by them in their capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred at or prior to Closing. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the indemnification and related rights hereunder shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance expenses in connection with such indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that, to the extent required by Law, the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification and provided further that neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable for any losses or expenses arising out of (i) any Action initiated by the indemnified Person or (ii) any settlement effected without its prior written consent. At Closing, Parent shall assume and become liable for, jointly and severally with the Surviving Corporation and each such Subsidiary, any liability and all obligations of the Company and each such Subsidiary under such provisions. 

   

 (b) Parent agrees that the Company and, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers fiduciary and liability insurance maintained by the Company by purchasing a policy providing "tail" coverage for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time with a carrier (or carriers) and in a form reasonably agreed upon by Company. Parent shall make available to Company evidence of said coverage immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however that Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not, in the aggregate, be required to pay a premium in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Cap") in order to purchase such policy; and provided, further, that if tail coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the Cap, then Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to purchase a policy or maintain policies that, in Parents good faith judgment, provides as much comparable insurance as is available at an aggregate premium equal to the Cap. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Following the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.7 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and each such Persons heirs, representatives, successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. 

   

 (d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any director or officer that is the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.7. 

   

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets in one or more transactions, regardless of whether related or unrelated, to any Person or Persons, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Shareholder Approval_.

If at any time prior to the receipt of the approval of the Companys shareholders there occurs any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company will promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement. Delivery of the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable approval of Parent and Merger Sub.

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (and shall not permit any committee thereof to) (i) (A) withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, adoption or recommendation by such board of directors of this Agreement and the Merger or fail to recommend to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement that they approve the Merger and give the Company Shareholder Approval or (B) endorse, approve, adopt, submit to Company shareholders (including by seeking to obtain an action by written consent of some or all of the Companys shareholders) or recommend, or propose publicly to endorse, approve, adopt, submit to shareholders of the Company or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) enter into, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to enter into, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar contract constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.11(b)) (any such document, an "Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and subject to Section 5.11(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably in its good faith judgment determines (after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.11, (1) make an Adverse Recommendation Change if such action is required for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable Laws or (2) if such action is required for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) and concurrently with such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ , however, that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) until after the fifth business day following receipt by Parent and Merger Sub of written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") from the Company advising Parent and Merger Sub that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors of the Company (including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation and the identity of Person making such Superior Proposal). During such five-business-day period, Parent and Merger Sub may offer the Company adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that will permit the Board of Directors of the Company to determine that, with such adjustments, the Merger is at least as favorable to the shareholders as such Superior Proposal. In determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause the Company to so terminate this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the financial or other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise.

reasonable best efforts to remove such injunction, order, decree or ruling as
and to the extent required by this Agreement; 

   

 (d) either the Company or Parent, if the Special Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Company Shareholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to any party whose breach of a representation or warranty or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement caused the failure to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval; 

   

 (e) either Company or Parent, if before Closing the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have (i) executed an Acquisition Agreement in accordance with Section 5.11(c) or (ii) resolved to do the foregoing;

 Section 9.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by a party hereto entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party hereto, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action by the parties hereto, except that the provisions of Sections 5.1(b), 9.2(b), and 10.1 through 10.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any party hereto of any liability for any willful breach of any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) In the event that: 

    

 (i) (A) Parent or the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d), (B) at or prior to the Special Meeting, any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates) shall have made public an Acquisition Proposal and (C) within one (1) year of termination of this Agreement, the Company executes an Acquisition Agreement; or 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(e) or 9.1(f), 

   ##### 

  

   

then the Company shall pay to the Persons listed in Section 9.2(b) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule an aggregate fee of $22.4 million (in the
individual amounts set forth opposite each such Persons name in such Section
9.2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than five business days after such termination (in
the case of clause (ii) above) or on the date of entry into such Acquisition
Agreement (in the case of clause (i) above). The Company acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 9.2(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. The Company and Parent, on behalf of themselves and their
Affiliates, agree that any payment required to be made pursuant to Section
9.2(b) shall be in full satisfaction of any expense reimbursement claims and
shall represent liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Parent and its Affiliates for the Loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and upon payment in
accordance herewith neither the Company nor its Affiliates shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein. For the purpose of this
Section 9.2(b) references to "Acquisition Proposal" (including its use in
determining whether there exists an Acquisition Agreement) shall have the
meaning ascribed to such term, except that references to "twenty percent
(20%)" shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)". 

  

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(g), then the Parent shall pay to Company a fee of $30.0 million by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than five business days after such termination. The Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement. The Company and Parent, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, agree that any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 9.2(c) shall be in full satisfaction of any expense reimbursement claims and shall represent liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates for the Loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and upon payment in accordance herewith neither the Parent nor its Affiliates (including without limitation the Equity Sponsors, affiliates and Merger Sub) shall have any further liability or obligation relating or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein.

 Section 10.2 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE. 

  

 Section 10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and the Confidentiality Agreements contain the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, and negotiations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule, each party shall be responsible for and shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether the Merger is or is not consummated; provided, however, that in the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever, Parent shall upon such termination reimburse 100% of the aggregate amount of all of the out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of, or paid or to be paid by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any work undertaken to assist Parent with financing the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, in each case, fees and expenses of counsel, investment bankers, accountants, and appraisers). No later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent pay-off letters or final invoices for the parties disclosed in Section 10.4 of the Disclosure Schedule. The pay-off letters or final invoices shall provide that the amounts set forth therein represent payment in full for all fees and expenses payable by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All such amounts shall be paid by the Company at or prior to Closing. 

  

 Section 10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective against the parties that have executed and delivered the Agreement when one or more counterparts have been signed by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and delivered to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. 

  

 Section 10.6 _Successors and Assigns_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned prior to the Closing by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors or assigns, heirs, legatees, distributees, executors, administrators and 

   ##### 

  

    

guardians. At the election of Parent, any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Merger Sub as a constituent
corporation in the Merger, so long as such substitution would not reasonably
be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any Company Required
Governmental Approval or Parent Required Governmental Approval or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii) significantly
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise, (iv) materially delay the consummation of the Merger or (v)
otherwise negatively affect the Company or its shareholders. If the
requirements of the previous sentence are met and Parent wishes to designate
another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a constituent
corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, then all references herein to Merger Sub
shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation. 

  

 Section 10.7 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, may be modified, waived or amended only by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought (or, in the case of a waiver, by the intended beneficiary of the waived term or provision). The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part of this Agreement or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. 

  

 Section 10.8 _No Implied Representation; Non-Survival_. Notwithstanding anything contained in Article III or IV or any other provision of this Agreement, it is the explicit intent of each party hereto that the Company is making no representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given in this Agreement, including any implied warranty or representation as to condition, merchantability or suitability as to any of the properties or assets of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and it is understood that Parent and Merger Sub take the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as is and where is. It is understood that any estimates, projections or other predictions contained or referred to in the Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule or in the materials that have been provided to Parent are not and shall not be deemed to be representations or warranties of the Company. The representations, warranties, and covenants (other than those covenants which by their terms contemplate performance after the Effective Time) in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall terminate at the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 10.9 _Construction of Certain Provisions_. It is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to 

   ##### 

  

    

whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or
included in the Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule is or
is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Except as otherwise
explicitly specified to the contrary, (a) the word "including" will be
construed as "including without limitation," and (b) words in the singular or
plural form include the plural and singular form, respectively. 

  

 Section 10.10 _Headings_. The Section and Article headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All references to Sections or Articles contained in this Agreement mean Sections or Articles of this Agreement, unless otherwise stated.

For the purposes of this Agreement references to the "Knowledge of the Company" in this Agreement, or words of similar import, shall mean the actual knowledge after due inquiry of the Companys executive officers listed in Section 10.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, and references to the "Knowledge of Parent" in this Agreement, or words of similar import, shall mean the actual knowledge after due inquiry of Parents executive officers listed in Section 10.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 Section 10.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Section 5.7, insofar as it relates to director and officer indemnification and insurance, shall inure for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, such directors and officers entitled to such indemnification. Except as otherwise provided by the terms hereof, this Agreement shall not confer upon any Person not a party hereto (or their successors and assigns permitted by Section 10.6) any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 Section 10.13 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained in this Agreement, unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would result in such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated hereby to be unreasonable. 

  

 Section 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
