# ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

  

## 

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

  

### (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the New York Business Corporation
Law (the " _NYBCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the
applicable provisions of the NYBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to be amended in its
entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be changed to "CH Energy Group, Inc.", until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to
_Section 5.10_. In addition, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law, subject to _Section 5.10_.

  

### (c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been
duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause up to three (3) members of the Company Board designated by the
Company who are members of the Company Board as of the Closing and who are
reasonably acceptable to Parent to be elected to the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , that at least one
(1) such designee shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

  

### (d) After the Effective Time, if the Surviving Corporation
shall determine or shall be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the

  

       

  

  

Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all
such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such
rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement.

  



  

 Section 1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause an appropriate certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of New York in accordance with the relevant provisions of the NYBCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the NYBCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of New York or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ". 

  

# ARTICLE II 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

### (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to
_Section 2.2_ , each share of common stock, $0.10 par value, of the Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ "), other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ , shall be
converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest, $65.00 per
Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)_ ) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures for
surrender of such Shares as set forth in _Section 2.2_.

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Ultimate Parent-
Owned Stock_. All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or
owned of record by any Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by
Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their

  

       

  

  

respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

  



  

### (c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

### (d) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided _ that no such adjustment shall result in any increase or
decrease of the Aggregate Merger Consideration.

  

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in (i) short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's, respectively, or (iii) deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise), in each case, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to promptly make such cash payments.

  

### (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event within three (3) Business Days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time
pursuant to this

  

       

  

  

Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify after consultation with the Company; and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares were converted pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ , and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made and Merger Consideration may be issued to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
so surrendered or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate and each
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration into which the Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  



  

### (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in
Shares_. As of the close of business on the date of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No
Liability_. At any time following nine (9) months after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of

  

       

  

  

their Shares and compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_
, without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed as of the date that is immediately prior to
such time as such Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or similarly
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

### (e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective agents (including the Paying
Agent), as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Company Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Other
Equity-Based Awards, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective agents (including the Paying
Agent) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under
the Code or any other provision of applicable Law (including any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law); _provided _ that any transfer or
other similar Taxes payable in connection with the Merger (other than such
Taxes required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the holder of record of the Shares with respect to
which such payment is made) shall be borne and paid by Parent and Merger Sub.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any agent and paid to the applicable Tax authorities,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options, Restricted Shares,
Restricted Stock Units or Other Equity-Based Awards, as applicable, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or their applicable agent, as the case may be.

  

### (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event
that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

  

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Options, Restricted Shares,
Restricted Stock Units, Other Equity Based Awards and Equity Plans_.

  

 (a) _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time:

  

#### (i) _Treatment of Company Options_. Each outstanding option
to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") granted pursuant to any
equity incentive

  

       

  

  

plan of the Company, including the Company's Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan,
Long-Term Performance-Based Incentive Plan and any other plan, agreement or
arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Plans_ "), shall, without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former
holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in
settlement therefor and full satisfaction thereof, a payment in cash (subject
to any withholding in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) equal to the product
of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option
and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the
exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such
amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ "). In each case, the
Option Payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Closing
Date. From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option
shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only
entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment. No interest shall
be paid or accrued on any cash payable with respect to any Company Option.

  



  

#### (ii) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. Each unvested Share
subject to forfeiture restrictions, repurchase rights or other restrictions
(each, a " _Restricted Share_ ") granted pursuant to any Company Equity Plan
shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest in full, and
all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or repurchase rights)
otherwise applicable to such Restricted Share shall lapse, and each Restricted
Share shall be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration, without interest (subject to any withholding in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ ). In each case, payment with respect to any
Restricted Shares shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date.

  

#### (iii) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units and Other Equity-Based
Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each contractual right to
receive a Share of Company Common Stock or the value of such a Share (each, an
" _Other Equity-Based Award_ "), including restricted stock units, phantom
shares, and performance shares (such restricted stock units, phantom shares
and performance shares collectively, " _Restricted Stock Units_ "), granted
pursuant to any Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall, without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest in full, and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions
or repurchase rights) otherwise applicable to such Other Equity-Based Award
shall lapse, and each Other Equity-Based Award shall be cancelled and in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Other Equity-Based
Award shall be entitled to receive, in settlement therefor and full
satisfaction thereof, a payment in cash (subject to any withholding in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ ) equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares subject to the Other Equity-Based
Award as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
any Restricted Stock Units subject to performance-based vesting conditions,
the applicable performance criteria shall be deemed to have been satisfied
based on (A) target level of attainment or (B) actual attainment during the
full fiscal quarters of the Company completed during the applicable
performance period prior to the Effective Time, whichever results in a greater
payment, in each case without proration

  

       

  

  

notwithstanding the early termination (if any) of the applicable performance
period. In each case, payment with respect to any Other Equity-Based Award
shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that in the case of any Other Equity-Based Awards that constitute
deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, payment
shall occur on the date that it would otherwise occur under the applicable
award agreement absent the application of this _Section 2.3(a)(iii)_ to the
extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalty or other taxes under
Section 409A of the Code. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash
payable with respect to any Other Equity-Based Award.

  



  

### (b) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. After the
Effective Time, all Company Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further
Company Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, Other Equity-Based
Awards or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

  

### (c) _Parent Funding_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
make a cash contribution to the Surviving Corporation in immediately available
funds to permit the Surviving Corporation to make the payments required under
this _Section 2.3_.

The Company (a) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company and Utility Subsidiary in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (b) based on its most recent evaluation of internal control prior to the date hereof, has disclosed to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, except with respect to clause (a), those failures to design or maintain that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

### (b) _General Compliance_. Each Company Benefit Plan has
been established, administered, and maintained in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (i) all contributions
required to be made under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan have been
timely made or have been reflected in the Company Financial Statements, and
(ii) all Company Benefit Plans that are subject to Section 409A of the Code
are in compliance with the requirements of Code Section 409A. Except as
required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any Company Benefit Plan
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, no condition or
circumstance exists that would prevent the amendment or termination of any
Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
incurred, and no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
condition or circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to result,
directly or indirectly, in, any material unsatisfied liability of the Company
under Title IV of ERISA or Sections 412 or 430 of the Code or Sections 302 or

### (c) _Tax Qualification of Plans_. (i) Each Company Benefit
Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has either
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all applicable
Tax law changes, as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter
for a prototype plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event
has occurred that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code, (ii) each VEBA has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from
Federal income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no fact or event has occurred that would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the tax-exempt status of any such
VEBA, (iii) there has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, other than a transaction
that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption), with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company, and (iv) no suit,

  

       

  

  

administrative proceeding, claim, audit, examination, investigation, action or
other litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is

any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor (other
than routine benefits claims) that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has filed, or is preparing to file, an application under the IRS
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the Department of Labor's
Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan.

Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company Benefit Plan that is a single-
employer pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or part 3 of Subtitle A of

as reflected in the Company Financial Statements, the actuarial present value
of the accumulated plan benefits (whether or not vested) under the Single
Employer Plans as of the close of the most recent plan year did not exceed the
market value of the assets allocable thereto, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, since such date, there has been no material adverse change in the
financial condition of any Single Employer Plan. With respect to each Single
Employer Plan, except as would not have or reasonably be expected to result in
a material liability of the Company, (i) no reportable event (within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, other than an event for which the reporting
requirements have been waived by regulations) has occurred or is expected to
occur, (ii) none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has failed to
satisfy the minimum funding standard within the meaning of Sections 412 and

proceeding has been commenced by the PBGC to terminate, or appoint a trustee
under Title IV of ERISA to administer, any Single Employer Plan and (vi) no
liability has been incurred under Section 4062(e) of ERISA.

the payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent event), to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Company

  

       

  

  

Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan
that is reasonably expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Except as listed in
_Section 3.12(g)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to pay, gross up or otherwise

Subsidiary to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any

the right of the Company to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company

in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (it being

Board Recommendation_ "), (iv) allow or cause the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 5.4(d)_ , at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval and so long as the Company is in compliance with this _Section 5.4_ ,
if (A) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal
is not withdrawn, or (B) there occurs any change, event, occurrence, effect or
development that (1) is material,

  

       

  

  

individually or in the aggregate, with any other such fact, change, event,
circumstance, occurrence, effect or development, (2) does not involve or
relate to an Acquisition Proposal and (3) is not known to the Company Board as
of the date hereof, the Company Board may, in the cases of clauses (A) or (B),
make a Change of Company Board Recommendation if (and only if) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board may not make a Change of Company Board Recommendation unless (i)
the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent that the Company Board
intends to effect a Change of Company Board Recommendation (a " _Notice of
Change of Recommendation_ "), which notice shall specify the reasons therefor
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, include the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach a copy of the most current
draft of any written agreement relating thereto, (ii) the Company has
negotiated in good faith with Parent (including by making the Company's
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) with respect to any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five (5)

Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, if Parent has committed to any changes to the terms of this
Agreement and there has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of
such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new Notice of Change
of Recommendation and an additional three (3) Business Day period from the
date of such notice) and (iii) taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, that the failure by it to make a Change of Company Board
Recommendation would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal continues to
meet the definition of the term "Superior Proposal". The parties agree that
nothing in this _Section 5.4(e)_ shall in any way limit or otherwise affect
the Company's right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 7.1(f)_. The
parties agree that nothing in this _Section 5.4(e) _ shall in any way limit
or otherwise affect Parent's right to terminate this Agreement under _Section
7.1(e)_. Any such Change of Company Board Recommendation shall not change the
approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board in any
respect that would have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute
or other similar statute or any provision of the Company Certificate to be
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
Notwithstanding any Change of Company Board Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholder
Meeting for the purpose of approving the Merger, and nothing contained in this
_Section 5.4_ , including any rights of the Company to take certain actions
pursuant to this _Section 5.4_, shall be deemed to relieve the Company of
such obligation.

  



  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval and so long as the Company is in compliance with this _Section 5.4_ ,
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal
has not been withdrawn, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the failure
to do

  

       

  

  

so would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 5.4(f)_ , and any purported termination pursuant to this
_Section 5.4(f)_ shall be void, unless (i) concurrently with such termination
the Company pays (or causes a third party to pay) the Company Termination Fee
payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ , (ii) the Company has provided prior
written notice to Parent that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach a copy of the
definitive agreement proposed to be entered into with respect to such Superior
Proposal, (iii) the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent
(including by making the Company's Representatives reasonably available to
negotiate) with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement
committed to by Parent for at least five (5) Business Days following receipt
by Parent of such Notice of Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that if Parent has committed to any changes to the terms of this Agreement and
there has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior
Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new Notice of Change of
Recommendation and an additional three (3) Business Day period from the date
of such notice) and (iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, that such Superior Proposal continues to meet the definition
of the term "Superior Proposal" and the failure by it to terminate this
Agreement to enter into the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

### (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit
the Company Board from (i) disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
make such disclosure would be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company or would be required by Law (for the avoidance of
doubt, it being agreed that the fact that a disclosure or other action may be
deemed permissible by virtue of this sentence does not in and of itself mean
that such disclosure or other action does not constitute a Change of Company
Board Recommendation and the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
shall not constitute a Change of Company Board Recommendation).

  

Section 5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

  

### (a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii)
obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action
or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with
the HSR Act and the New York Public Service Law), in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

  

       

  

  

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) cause the
satisfaction of all conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , (iv) defend all
lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other proceedings to which it is a
party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance

injunction or restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (vi) as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within 60 days after the date
hereof, make or cause to be made all necessary applications and filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under or with respect to the Company Required Governmental Approvals, the DPA
and any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in connection with determining whether any action by
or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The Company and
Parent shall furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable
Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither the Company nor Parent shall consent to any voluntary delay of the
Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the
other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Neither Ultimate Parent, Parent nor the Company, directly or
indirectly through one or more of their respective affiliates, shall take any
action, including acquiring or making any investment in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other business organization or any
division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause a
material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Article VI
_ or the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any
and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust,
merger control, competition or trade regulation Law or any other Law
applicable to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Merger that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Effective Time and the Closing, respectively, to occur as promptly as
practicable (and in any event, no later than the Extended Outside Date),
including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or (B) accepting any operational restrictions,
including restrictions on the ability to change rates or charges or standards
of service, or otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit
Parent's or any Parent Subsidiary's freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain or freely operate, any of the assets, properties, licenses,
rights, product lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Effective Time or the Closing, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be
required to, and the Company shall not, in connection with obtaining any
consents or approvals hereunder, or in connection with otherwise complying
with any provisions of this Agreement, consent to or take any action of the
types described above, including proposing or making any

  

       

  

  

divestiture or other undertaking or proposing, accepting or entering into any
consent decree, hold separate order or operational restriction, in each case,
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the exclusions set forth
in the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to
apply to any reference to "material adverse effect" in this _Section 5.5(a)_.

  



  

### (b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company and
Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any
Company Scheduled Contracts in connection with consummation of the Merger and
in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the event
that either party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in
this _Section 5.5(b)_ , such party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and
shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to
minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses resulting, or which could
reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, as applicable,
from the failure to obtain such consent.

  

### (c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained
in this _Section 5.5_ , each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties
prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the FERC, the FCC, the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation (" _NYDEC_ "), the NYPSC, CFIUS or
any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger. Each party hereto will
consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith
the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party
hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding.

  

### (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business
operations.

until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly after obtaining
knowledge thereof, notify the other party hereto of: (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to
effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied; (b) the failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; (c) any
material actions, suits, claims or proceedings with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced against the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or Parent, as the case may be (and the Company shall give

shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)); and (d) any written notice or
other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

  

Seciton 5.7 _Public Announcment_. The Company, on the one hand, and

before issuing any press release or public statement announcing the execution

generally that primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent
with a copy of the intended communication and provide Parent with a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on the communication.

shall be treated as service with Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to the extent such service was credited
for similar purposes under a similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized (i) for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan

  

       

  

  

other than any Single Employer Plan, or (ii) to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Company Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the Effective Time, to the extent so recognized under such applicable
Company Benefit Plan.

  

### (e) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,

Section 5.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Law
becomes, or is deemed to be, applicable to the Merger, including the

employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, arising out of acts or
omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company

agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement and filed as an
exhibit to a Company SEC Document, including any expenses incurred in
enforcing such Person's rights under this _Section 5.10_ , regardless of
whether indemnification with respect to or advancement of such expenses is
authorized under the Company Certificate, the Company By-laws, the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any
Company Subsidiary, or such indemnification agreements; _provided_ , _however_
, that the director, officer or employee to whom expenses are advanced

action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters
subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.10(a)_

suit, proceeding or investigation.

pay the premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Company's existing policy (true and complete copies of
which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the portion of the premium payable in respect of each year of
such coverage shall not exceed 300%

  

       

  

  

of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which
annual premium is disclosed on Section 5.10(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter). If the Company is unable to purchase such DandO Insurance prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the
premium for DandO Insurance that is substantially equivalent to and in any event

to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premium would at any time exceed 300%, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to provide the maximum available
coverage as may be obtained for 300% from an insurance carrier having a

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

  

### (e) The obligations under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any past or
present directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom this _Section
5.10_ applies without the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly

express third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_ ).

  

Section 5.11 _Agreements Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent hereby guarantees
the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub
of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance

in any activity of any nature except as provided in or expressly contemplated
by this Agreement.

(" _Section 16_ ") of Shares or other Equity Interests in the Company
(including Company    Options, Restricted Stock and Other Equity-Based

identify such redemption as being pursuant to this _Section 5.14(a)_.

cause such redemption), such redemption to be completed as close as possible
to, but not later than, the Closing, pursuant to the terms of such Utility
Subsidiary Preferred Stock. Parent agrees that, if this Agreement is
terminated other than pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ , Parent shall reimburse
the Company for one hundred percent (100%) of its out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred (including any premium paid but excluding the par amount of

liability or damage suffered by Parent as a result of the willful and material

agreements set forth in this Agreement). In no event shall the Company be

amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by the Company's
shareholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  

Section 7.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent

Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects
the rights of the Company's shareholders hereunder without the approval of
such shareholders at a duly convened meeting of the Company's shareholders
called to obtain approval of such extension or waiver. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_.

  

 (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief without the posting of any bond, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically in the courts of the State of New York located in New York County, New York and of the United States of America located in the Southern District of New York the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing: (i) the Company shall be entitled to specific performance (A) to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of, _Section 5.5_ by Parent or Merger Sub or _Section 8.15_ by Ultimate Parent and (B) if (x) all conditions in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied and (y) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_ , to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including to cause Ultimate Parent, Parent and/or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.2_ , on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance if (A) all conditions in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3 _ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied and (B) the

provisions of this Agreement, including to cause the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section 1.2_ , on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis
that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity.

  



  

### (b) The parties further agree that (i) the seeking of the
remedies provided for in _Section 8.14(a)_ shall not in any respect constitute
a waiver by any party seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement,
including under _Section 7.2_ , in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in _Section 8.14(a)_
are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in
this Agreement shall require a party to institute any proceeding for (or limit
a party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
_Section 8.14(a)_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to _Section 8.14(a)_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 8.14(b)_ restrict or limit a party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

  

Section 8.15 _Ultimate Parent Guarantee_.

  

### (a) Ultimate Parent hereby irrevocably, absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the due, prompt and punctual payment
and performance when due of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations and
agreements under this Agreement up to and including the Closing, including the
consummation of the Merger, the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
and the performance of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under _Sections
2.2_ and _5.5_ , it being understood that Ultimate Parent shall have no
obligation to guarantee any post-Closing obligations or agreements. Ultimate
Parent's obligations are unconditional irrespective of any circumstances which
might otherwise constitute, by operation of law, a discharge of a guarantor
and it shall not be necessary for the Company to institute or exhaust any
remedies or causes of action against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person
as a condition to the obligations of Ultimate Parent hereunder.

  

### (b) Ultimate Parent hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that it: (i) is a corporation or other legal entity duly incorporated
or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the

or other legal entity, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted; (ii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of Ultimate
Parent, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its obligations
hereunder; and (iii) owns, directly

  

       

  

  

or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other Equity Interests in Parent.

  



  

### (c) Ultimate Parent hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that: (i) it has the requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the
case may be, power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; (ii) the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Ultimate Parent, and the performance by Ultimate Parent of
its obligations hereunder, have been duly and validly authorized by all
requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be, action on the
part of Ultimate Parent and no other corporate or other legal entity, as the
case may be, proceedings on the part of Ultimate Parent, and no shareholder or
other equityholder votes, are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
perform its obligations hereunder; (iii) this Agreement has been duly
authorized and validly executed and delivered by Ultimate Parent and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Ultimate Parent, enforceable against Ultimate Parent
in accordance with its terms, except that (x) such enforcement may be subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (y) the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought; and (iv) none of the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by Ultimate Parent will (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both): (x) conflict with or violate any
provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or any equivalent
organizational or governing documents, of Ultimate Parent; (y) conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to Ultimate Parent or any of its properties or
assets; or (z) require any consent or approval under, violate, conflict with,
result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a
default under, or result in termination or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Ultimate Parent
pursuant to, any Contract or permit to which Ultimate Parent is a party or by
which it or any of its respective properties or assets are bound, except, with
respect to clauses (y) and (z), for any such conflicts, violations, consents,
breaches, losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or materially impair the ability of Ultimate Parent to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.
