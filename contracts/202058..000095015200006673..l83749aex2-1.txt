and become the right to receive the following (the "MERGER

"PURCHASE PRICE," respectively, for purposes of this Agreement, but shall not

"VALUATION DATE BALANCE SHEET" and the "PURCHASE PRICE," respectively, for
purposes of this Agreement, but shall not limit the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement. In the event any objections raised by the Shareholder
Representative are not resolved by Agreed Adjustments within the 30-day
period next following such 30-day period, then Parent and the
Shareholder Representative shall jointly select a national accounting firm
acceptable to both Parent and the Shareholder Representative (or if they
cannot agree on such selection, a national accounting firm will be selected
by lot after eliminating the independent public accountants for Parent and
the Company) and the firm so selected (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM") shall be
directed by Parent and the Shareholder Representative to conduct a special
audit of the Preliminary Valuation Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary
Purchase Price as promptly as reasonably practicable and, upon completion of
such audit, to deliver written notice to each of Parent and the Shareholder
Representative setting forth:    -10-  16   (i) a summary of all
adjustments (including all adjustments for  immaterial misstatements which
became known to the Accounting Firm during  the course of such audit) to the
Preliminary Valuation Date Balance Sheet  and the Preliminary Purchase Price
necessary to permit the Accounting Firm  to deliver the hereinafter described
audit report; and   (ii) an audit report stating (without qualification)
that in its  opinion (x) the Preliminary Valuation Date Balance Sheet (after
giving  effect to such adjustments) as audited by such firm has been prepared
in  accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, (y) the Preliminary 
Purchase Price (after giving effect to such adjustments) has been  determined
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and (z) all  adjustments
(which became known to the Accounting Firm during the course of  the above-
described audit) for items or matters, regardless of the amount  thereof,
were taken into account in the adjustments referred to in clause  (i) (such
written notice and related summary and certificate being herein  called the
"ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING REPORT").   The Preliminary Valuation Date Balance
Sheet and the Preliminary Purchase Price, as so determined but after giving
effect to the adjustments set forth in the Additional Accounting Report shall
be final and binding as the "VALUATION DATE BALANCE SHEET" and the "PURCHASE
PRICE," respectively, for purposes of this Agreement, but shall not limit the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement.   (d) The parties hereto shall make
available to Parent, the Shareholder Representative and, if applicable, the
Accounting Firm, such books, records and other information (including work
papers) as they may reasonably request to audit or review the Preliminary
Accounting Report hereunder. One half of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm related to any special audit of the Preliminary Valuation
Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Purchase Price hereunder shall be paid
by the former shareholders of the Company (in the form of a payment pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement) and the other half shall be paid by Parent. In
connection with any such special audit or determination or review of the
Preliminary Valuation Date Balance Sheet or the Preliminary Purchase Price
hereunder, Parent, the Shareholder Representative and, if applicable,
the Accounting Firm shall exchange work papers and other information related
to such audit or the determination of the Valuation Date Balance Sheet and
the Closing Consideration hereunder with a view towards resolving any
potential differences with respect thereto.  (e) Promptly after the
determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to this SECTION 3.2 that is
final and binding, Parent shall be entitled to receive a payment, pursuant to
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Escrow Agreement, in an
amount, if any, by which the Target Net Worth exceeds the Valuation Date Net
Worth (the "NET WORTH ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT").   -11-  17  3.3. EXCHANGE
PROCEDURES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit
with an exchange to be determined by Parent prior to the Closing (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE III, through the Exchange
Agent, cash equal to the Closing Consideration (such cash, together with any
earnings with respect thereto, and such certificates being hereinafter
referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND").   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.   (i)
Prior to the Effective Date, the counsel to the Company or the  Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or  certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented  outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock that were converted into the  right to receive the
Merger Consideration (the "COMPANY CERTIFICATES")  pursuant to SECTION 3.1,
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify  that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company  Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to  the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions  as Parent and the
Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for  use in effecting
the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for  the Per Share
Closing Payment for each share of Company Common Stock  represented by such
Company Certificates.   (ii) Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for
cancellation to the  Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed,  and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange  Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall
be entitled to receive,  in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock
represented thereby, the  Per Share Closing Payment, and the Company
Certificate so surrendered shall  forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company  Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company,  payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the  Company Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Company  Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or  other taxes required by reason of such
payment to a Person other than the  registered holder of such Company
Certificate or establish to the  satisfaction of Parent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable.  Subject to the applicable provisions of the
WBCA, until surrendered as  contemplated by this SECTION 3.3, each Company
Certificate shall be deemed  at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive  upon such surrender the Per Share
Closing Payment for each share of Company  Common Stock represented by such
Company Certificate as contemplated by  this SECTION 3.3. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on   -12-  18   any cash payable, whether in respect of
the Per Share Closing Payments,  dividends or otherwise, upon surrender of
any Company Certificate.   (c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON
STOCK. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE III upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligations to pay or provide for the rights of dissenters.
If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares
of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this ARTICLE III.   (d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
Company Common Stock for twelve months after the Closing Date shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holder of
Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration.   (e) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Company Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Per
Share Closing Payments payable in respect of such Company Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any
such shares, cash dividends or distribution in respect of such Company
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f) INVESTMENT OF
EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a daily basis.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to the Surviving Corporation.   (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. The Surviving Corporation will pay such
withheld amounts to the appropriate taxing authority.   (h) CERTAIN
ADJUSTMENTS. If after the date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,   -13-  19  combination or
exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is
declared thereon with a record date within such period, or any similar event
shall occur, the Per Share Closing Payment will be adjusted accordingly to
provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend or similar event. This provision is not intended to affect the need
for either party to obtain the other party\'s consent to take such an action
under any other provision of this Agreement.   (i) DISSENTER\'S RIGHTS.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Dissenters\' Shares shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive any of the Merger Consideration, but the holder shall only
be entitled to such rights as are granted by the WBCA. If a holder of shares
of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under the WBCA
shall effectively withdraw or otherwise lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each such share of Company
Common Stock shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive
the Per Share Closing Payment, without interest, upon the surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such share of Company Common Stock
and the Per Share Escrow Payment pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal
of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the WBCA received by the Company
relating to shareholders\' rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer
to settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Company shall properly obtain from the Shareholders (1) approval of the

files, retrieval programs and similar documentation) of the Company to the
extent Parent shall deem necessary or desirable, and shall furnish to Parent
or its authorized representatives such additional information concerning the
operations, properties and business of the Company as may be reasonably
requested to enable Parent or its representatives to verify the accuracy of
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, to verify

investigation made by Parent or its representatives hereunder shall affect
the representations and warranties of the Shareholder Representative
hereunder.   7.4. PRESERVE ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each

Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated

knowledge.    -46-  51    7.8. MUTUAL COOPERATION; REASONABLE BEST
EFFORTS. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other, and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause as promptly as possible the
fulfillment of the conditions to each other party\'s obligations hereunder,
including without limitation SECTIONS 9.3 and 10.2, and to obtain as promptly
as possible all consents, authorizations, orders or approvals from each and
every third party, whether private or governmental, required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the foregoing shall not require Parent or the Company to make any divestiture
or consent to any divestiture in order to obtain any consent, authorization
or fulfill any condition or approval.   7.9. COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS. (a)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the 1995 Stock
Option Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Plan and any other stock-based
incentive plan or arrangement providing for compensation or consideration
wholly or partially in the form of shares of Company Common Stock or any
other capital stock of the Company (collectively, the "STOCK OPTION PLANS"),
and shall grant no additional options, awards or rights ("COMPANY
STOCK OPTIONS") under such Stock Option Plans on or after the date of this
Agreement, except such options, awards or rights that the Company has, prior
to the date of this Agreement agreed to grant or proposed to grant (subject
to approval by the Company\'s Board of Directors) in connection with the
commencement of an individual\'s employment with the Company or in connection
with an employee\'s promotion to a new position, all of which are set forth
on SCHEDULE 7.9. SCHEDULE 7.9 identifies each Company Stock Option as of the
date of this Agreement, the Stock Option Plan pursuant to which such Company
Stock Option was granted, the holder of such Company Stock Option, the number
of shares subject to such Company Stock Option, the current exercise price of
such Company Stock Option and whether such Company Stock Option is an
incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code.   (b) The Company
shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to cause all Company Stock
Options that are, or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement become, outstanding, vested and exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be exercised, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time and contingent on the Closing of the Merger, in accordance
with their terms and the individual agreements and plans governing such
Company Stock Options. The holder of any Company Stock Option (each
an "OPTION HOLDER") that is partially or fully vested and is not exercised as
of the Effective Time will be entitled to receive, in consideration thereof,
for each share of Company Common Stock subject to the vested portion of the
Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject thereto. The amounts payable pursuant to this SECTION 7.9(b)
shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date
without interest thereon and shall be subject to and made net of all
applicable withholding taxes. Upon receipt of such payment in respect of the
vested portion of any Company Stock Option, such vested portion of the
Company Stock Option shall be cancelled. The receipt by the Option Holder of
the consideration contemplated by this SECTION 7.9(b) shall be deemed a
release of any and all rights the Option Holder thereof had or may have had
in respect    -47-  52   of the applicable Company Stock Option with
respect to the vested portion of such Company Stock Option.   (c) At the
Effective Time, the unvested portion of each Company Stock Option that is
outstanding immediately subsequent to the Effective Time shall become and
represent an option to purchase the number of shares of common stock ("PARENT
COMMON STOCK") of Parent under Parent\'s stock option plan (a "SUBSTITUTE
OPTION") determined by dividing (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the unvested portion of such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (as
defined in SECTION 7.9(e), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest cent), equal to the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio. Any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting
from the formula described in the foregoing sentence shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number. It is the intention of the parties that the above
formula shall be applied in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the
Code. Parent will grant incentive stock options to acquire Parent Common
Stock as Substitute Options for incentive stock options to acquire Company
Common Stock and grant nonqualified stock options to acquire Parent Common
Stock as Substitute Options for nonqualified stock options to acquire Company
Common Stock. After the Effective Time, each Substitute Option shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent\'s stock option plan and
standard terms and conditions of options granted thereunder, except that each
Substitute Option shall provide that: (i) upon the first anniversary of the
Closing Date such option shall be vested and exercisable for one-half (1/2)
of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Substitute Option as of
the Closing Date; (ii) upon the second anniversary of the Closing Date such
option shall be vested and exercisable for three-fourths (3/4) of the shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to such Substitute Option as of the Closing
Date; and (iii) upon the third anniversary of the Closing Date such option
shall be fully vested and exercisable for all of the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such Substitute Option as of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may take any action or make any
amendment to the Substitute Options as Parent deems necessary or advisable so
that the Substitute Options comply with the requirements of Section 424(a)
of the Code.   (d) The Company (i) shall take all action necessary to
implement the provisions of this SECTION 7.9, including amending the
agreements representing the outstanding stock option awards under the 1999
Stock Option Plan pursuant to resolution by the Company\'s Board of Directors
in form and substance satisfactory to Parent and obtaining the written
consent of each Option Holder of a 1999 Company Stock Option to such
amendments in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, and (ii) shall
provide Parent with duly executed copies of such amendments and consents
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
use its best efforts to obtain any other necessary consents or releases from
the Option Holders and to take any such other lawful action as may be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to this SECTION 7.9.    -48- 
53   (e) For purposes of this SECTION 7.9, the "Exchange Ratio" shall
be determined by dividing the Per Share Parent Price by the Per Share
Company Price. The "Per Share Parent Price" shall be the average per share
closing price for Parent Common Stock as listed on the New York Stock
Exchange for the 10 trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date and
the "Per Share Company Price" shall be the Fully Diluted Per Share Price.  
7.10. STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent,
Mergerco and the Company and the respective Boards of Directors of Mergerco
and the Company shall use their best efforts to grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.   7.11. TERMINATION OF
COMPANY 401(k) PLAN. The Company shall terminate the Company\'s 401(k) Plan
prior to the Effective Date and shall deliver to Parent a written resolution,
in form and substance acceptable to Parent, effecting such termination on or
before the Effective Date.   ARTICLE VIII   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   8.1.

to participate in any of Parent\'s employee benefit plans or programs
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Parent benefit
plans and programs and applicable law, such employees shall receive credit

vesting under Parent\'s employee benefit plans and programs, including,
without limitation, employee pension and welfare benefit plans   ARTICLE

part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.   12.9. FEES AND

portion of such Company Stock Option.   9. EXHIBIT B to the Merger
Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as attached
