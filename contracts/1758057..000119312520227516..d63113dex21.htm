assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and all such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the
Effective Time; and

(d) at the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of capital stock of the
Company held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

3.02 _Treatment of Capital Stock and Equity Interests in the Second

the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any

of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist without any
conversion thereof or payment therefor; and (b) the membership interests of

purposes to represent the number of membership interests into which they were

3.03 _Equitable Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, the outstanding shares of Company Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then any number, value (including dollar value) or amount contained herein
which is based upon the number of shares of Company Stock, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of such shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ shall not be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3.04 _Delivery of Per Share_ _Company Stock Consideration_.

(a) Concurrently with the mailing of the Consent Solicitation Statement,
Parent shall cause to be mailed to each Company Stockholder a letter of
transmittal substantially in the form of _Exhibit F_ hereto, with such changes
as may be required by Continental, acting in its capacity as the exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall (i) have customary
representations and warranties as to title, authorization, execution and
delivery and (ii) specify that delivery shall be effected only upon delivery
of the Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
instructions thereto.

 

(b) Upon the receipt of a Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
Company Stockholder holding such shares of Company Stock shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, the Per Share Company Stock Consideration into
which such shares of Company Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.01_ _,_ and the Earn Out Shares (in accordance with their respective
Earn Out Pro Rata Share) pursuant to  _Article_ __ _ IV_. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)_, each share of Company Stock
shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Company Stock
Consideration and Earn Out Shares which the Company Stockholders holding
shares of Company Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such shares
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)_. The delivery of the Per Share
Company Stock Consideration and Earn Out Shares shall be made in accordance
with the allocation set forth on the Company Closing Certificate as described
in  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(b)_.

3.05 _Conversion of Company Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as
may be required to effect the following:

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, to the
extent then outstanding and unexercised, shall automatically, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option to
acquire a number of shares of Parent Class A Stock at an adjusted exercise
price per share, in each case, as determined under this  _Section_ __ _
3.05(a)_ (each such resulting option, a " _Rollover Option_ "). Each Rollover
Option

 



28

    

 shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
corresponding Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including applicable vesting conditions), except to the extent such terms or
conditions are rendered inoperative by the Transactions. Accordingly,
effective as of the Effective Time: (i) each such Rollover Option shall be
exercisable solely for shares of Parent Class A Stock; (ii) the number of
shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to each Rollover Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Class A Stock
subject to the Company Stock Option by the Per Share Company
Stock Consideration and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Class A Stock; and (iii) the per share
exercise price for the Parent Class A Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Rollover Option shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price
for the shares of Company Class A Stock subject to the Company Stock Option,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Per Share Company
Stock Consideration, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the
nearest whole cent.

 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted
Stock, to the extent then unvested and outstanding, shall automatically,
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a
number of shares of Parent Class A Stock (the " _Rollover Restricted Stock_ ")
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Restricted Stock
subject to such award by the Per Share Company Stock Consideration and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Class A Stock. Each share of Rollover Restricted Stock shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
corresponding share of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including applicable vesting conditions), except to the extent
such terms or conditions are rendered inoperative by the Transactions.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversions described in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.05_ will be subject to such modifications, if any, as are
required to cause the conversion to be made in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, in the case of any Company
Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and
the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock purchasable pursuant to such
option shall be determined subject to such adjustments as are necessary in
order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board,
as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary and sufficient to cause the Company Stock Plan to terminate as of
the Effective Time (subject to the approval of the Parent Omnibus Incentive
Plan Proposal as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b))_.

3.06 _Conversion of Company Warrants_. Effective as of the Effective
Time, each Company Warrant, to the extent then outstanding and unexercised,
shall automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of Parent Class A
Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, as determined
under this _Section_ __ _ 3.06_ (each such resulting option, an " _Assumed
Warrant_ "). Each Assumed Warrant shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such corresponding Company Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including applicable vesting
conditions), except to the extent such terms or conditions are rendered
inoperative by the Transactions. Accordingly, effective as of the Effective
Time: (a) each such Assumed Warrant shall be exercisable solely for shares of
Parent

 



29

    

 Class A Stock; (b) the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to
each Assumed Warrant shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares
of Company Stock subject to the Company Warrant by the Per Share Company
Stock Consideration and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Class A Stock; and (c) the per share exercise
price for the Parent Class A Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company
Warrant shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price for the
shares of Company Stock subject to the Company Warrant, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Per Share Company Stock
Consideration, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent.

 

3.07 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity and their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise deliverable or payable under this Agreement such amounts
that any such Persons are required to deduct and withhold with respect to any
of the deliveries and payments contemplated by this Agreement under the Code
or any other applicable Law. To the extent that Parent, First Merger Sub,
Second Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity or their respective Affiliates withholds such amounts with respect to
any Person and pays such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been paid to or on
behalf of such Person for all purposes. In the case of any such payment
payable to employees of the Company or its Affiliates in connection with the
Mergers treated as compensation, the parties shall cooperate to pay such
amounts through the Companys or its Subsidiarys payroll to facilitate
applicable withholding.

3.08 _Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Class A Stock or Parent Class B Stock shall be issued upon
the conversion of Company Stock, as applicable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Class A Stock or Parent
Class B Stock. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent
shall pay to each former Company Stockholder who otherwise would be entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash, without interest, rounded
down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (a) the amount of the
fractional share interest in a share of Parent Class A Stock or Parent Class B
Stock, as applicable, to which such holder otherwise would have been entitled
but for this _Section_ __ _ 3.08_, multiplied by (b) $10.00.

3.09 _Payment of Expenses_ _and Company Indebtedness_. On the Closing Date
following the Closing, (a) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds all Outstanding Parent Expenses and
Outstanding Company Expenses as set forth on the Parent Closing Certificate
and the Company Closing Certificate, respectively, and (b) if the amount of
Closing Parent Cash plus the amount of all Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Company at the Closing exceeds $300,000,000, the Company shall pay or cause to
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds the aggregate amount
of the Company Closing Indebtedness as set forth on the Company Closing
Certificate.

 

3.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and owned by a Company Stockholder who is entitled to demand
and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and
who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive

 



30

    

 the Per Share Company Stock Consideration and the Earn Out Shares and shall
instead entitle such Company Stockholder only to such rights as may be granted
to him, her or it under the DGCL. If any such Company Stockholder fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such Company Stockholders
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL (or other applicable Law),
then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the
Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive
the Per Share Company Stock Consideration and the Earn Out Shares (in
accordance with their respective Earn Out Pro Rata Share), as applicable, in
accordance with this _Article_ _III_ and _Article_ __ _ IV_, as applicable.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL, and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree
or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ "), and any other
plan, policy, program, arrangement or agreement providing compensation or
benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee, independent
contractor or other service provider, in each case, that is maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company or its Subsidiaries or under which

severance, termination, change in control, collective bargaining, incentive,
bonus, deferred compensation, retirement, pension, vacation, holiday,
cafeteria, welfare, medical, disability, fringe benefit, profit-sharing, stock

or other stock-based compensation plans, policies, programs, practices,
arrangements or agreements.

 

(b) With respect to each material Company Benefit Plan, the Company has
delivered or made available to Parent or its representatives correct and
complete copies (or to the extent no copy exists, an accurate summary) of, if
applicable: (i) the current plan document and any trust agreement relating to
such plan; (ii) the most recent summary plan description, to the extent a
summary plan description is required for such plan; (iii) if applicable, the
most recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue Service
(or, with respect to non-U.S. plans, any comparable annual or periodic
report) and attached schedules (if applicable); (iv) the most recent actuarial
valuation, if applicable; (v) any non-routine communications with any
Governmental Authority during the past three (3) years; and (vi) the most
recent determination or opinion letter, if any, issued by the Internal Revenue
Service (or applicable comparable Governmental Authority).

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in compliance with its terms
and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and all
contributions required to be made under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan
as of the date this representation is made have been timely made or, if not
yet due, have been properly reflected in the Companys financial statements to
the extent required under GAAP.

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code: (i) has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter as to its qualification; or (ii) has been
established under a standardized master and prototype or volume submitter plan
for which a current favorable Internal Revenue Service advisory letter or
opinion letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the
adopting employer. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred or
condition exists that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact any
such plans or result in the loss of the tax-qualified status of such plans.

 



47

    

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates
sponsors, maintains, contributes to or was required to contribute to, or had
any liability in respect of (including by reason of sponsoring, maintaining or
contributing to or having an obligation to contribute to), at any point during
the six (6) year period prior to the date hereof, a multiemployer pension
plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or
other pension plan, in each case, regardless of whether or not it is subject
to Title IV of ERISA. No circumstance or condition exists that would result
in any liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Multiemployer Plan or other pension plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any entity
(whether or not incorporated) other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company that, together with the Company or any Subsidiary, is considered under
common control and treated as one (1) employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan is a (i) multiple employer plan
(within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the
Code) or (ii) a multiple employer welfare arrangement (within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA). Except as required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part
6 of Title I of ERISA or other applicable Law, no Company Benefit Plan
provides for any benefits or coverage in the nature of health, life or
disability insurance following retirement or other termination to any current
or former director, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
Subsidiary (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof).

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (i) with respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no administrative
investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the Department of
Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or other Governmental Authorities is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, and (ii) there are no
actions or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan, and to the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances
that could form the basis for any such actions or claims. There has been no
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA that is not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and
regulatory guidance issued thereunder, and no breach of fiduciary duty (as
determined under ERISA) has occurred with respect to which the Company or
its Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit Plan would reasonably be expected to
have any material liability.

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(either alone or in combination with another event) will: (i) result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
bonus or otherwise) or benefit becoming due to any current or former
stockholder, director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the
Company or any its Subsidiaries, or any funding of benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan; (ii) increase any amount of compensation or benefits otherwise
payable to any current or former director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any its Subsidiaries; (iii) result in the
acceleration, vesting or creation of any rights of any current or former
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to payments or benefits or any loan forgiveness, in each case,
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (iv) result in
any new obligation pursuant to any of the Company Benefit Plans; provided that
the foregoing shall not include arrangements entered into by Parent prior to
the Closing Date.

 



48

    

(h) No amount or benefit that could be, or has been, received (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of cash or property or the cancellation of
indebtedness) by any current or former employee, officer, director or other
individual service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement could reasonably be expected to be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 

(i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code has been operated
in all material respects in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. No
Company Benefit Plan or award thereunder provides to any "service provider"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries any compensation or benefits which have subjected or could
reasonably be expected in the future to subject such service provider to gross
income inclusion or additional Tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.
No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up of any Taxes imposed by
Section 4999 or 409A of the Code or otherwise.

 

(j) There is no action currently contemplated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and no action has been taken by the Company or its

included therein, to normal year-end adjustments, the effect of which will
not, individually or in the aggregate, be material, and the absence of

disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports. No financial statements other than those
of Parent are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Parent.

conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their
respective businesses.

 

7.02 _Inspection_. Subject to confidentiality obligations and similar
restrictions (whether contractual, imposed by applicable Law or otherwise)
that may be applicable to information furnished to the Company or its
Subsidiaries by third parties that may be in the Companys or its
Subsidiaries possession from time to time, and except for any information
which (a) relates to interactions with prospective buyers of the Company or
the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions or (b) in the judgment
of legal counsel of the Company would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege or other privilege from disclosure or would conflict with any
applicable Law or confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, (i) afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during the
Interim Period,

 



74

    

 during normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice, in such
manner as to not interfere with the normal operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to all of their respective properties, books, projections,
plans, systems, Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, records, analyses and
appropriate officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) furnish such Representatives with all financial and operating data and
other information concerning the affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that are in the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries as such
Representatives may reasonably request. The parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements for such
disclosure where the restrictions in the preceding sentence apply. All
information obtained by Parent and its Representatives under this Agreement
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement prior to the Effective
Time.

7.03 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. On and as of the Closing, the

relevant parties thereunder following the Closing.

 

7.04 _No Parent Securities Transactions_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to require each of its controlled Affiliates
not to, engage in any transactions involving the securities of Parent without
the prior consent of Parent.

7.05 _No Claim Against the Trust Account_. The Company acknowledges that
Parent is a blank check company with the power and privileges to effect a
merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination
involving the Company and one or more businesses or assets, and the
Company understands that Parent has established the Trust Account for the
benefit of Parents public stockholders and that disbursements from the Trust
Account are available only in the limited circumstances set forth in Parents
final prospectus, dated January 31, 2019 and other Parent SEC Reports, the
Parent Organizational Documents, and the Trust Agreement. The Company further
acknowledges and agrees that Parents sole assets consist of the cash proceeds
of Parents initial public offering and private placements of its securities,
and that substantially all of these proceeds have been deposited in the Trust
Account for the benefit of its public stockholders. The Company further
acknowledges that, if the Transactions are not consummated by February 5,
2021 or such later date as approved by the Parent Stockholders to complete a
Business Combination, Parent will be obligated to return to its stockholders
the amounts being held in the Trust Account. Accordingly, the Company (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby waives any past, present or future
claim of any kind against, and any right to access, the Trust Account, any
trustee of the Trust Account and Parent to collect from the Trust Account any
monies that may be owed to them by Parent or any of its Affiliates for any
reason whatsoever, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account at any
time for any reason whatsoever, including for any Willful Breach of this
Agreement;  _provided_ , that (a) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit the Companys right to pursue a claim against Parent for (i) legal
relief against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account or (ii)
specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions so long as such claim would not affect
Parents ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the redemptions
pursuant to the Offer and (b) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit
any claims that the Company may have in the future against Parents assets or
funds that are not held in the Trust Account. This _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

 



75

    

7.06 _Proxy Solicitation; Other Actions_.

 

(a) The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide Parent, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, audited financial statements,
including consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of
cash flows, and statements of stockholders equity of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31,
2019, in each case, prepared in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X, and
audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, and unaudited interim
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X
covering the applicable periods required to be included in the Registration
Statement. The Company shall be available to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to make their officers and
employees available to, in each case, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advanced notice of not less than twenty four (24) hours, Parent and
its counsel in connection with (i) the drafting of the Registration Statement
and (ii) responding in a timely manner to comments on the Registration
Statement from the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with Parents
preparation for inclusion in the Registration Statement of pro forma financial
statements that comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under
the rules and regulations of the SEC (as interpreted by the staff of the SEC)
to the extent such pro forma financial statements are required by Form S-4.

 

(b) From and after the date on which the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, the Company will give Parent prompt
written notice of any action taken or not taken by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or of any development regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries,
in any such case which is known by the Company, that would cause
the Registration Statement to contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, not misleading; _provided_ , that, if any such
action shall be taken or fail to be taken or such development shall otherwise
occur, Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully to cause an amendment or
supplement to be made promptly to the Registration Statement, such that the
Registration Statement no longer contains an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that no information received by Parent pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the party who disclosed
such information, and no such information shall be deemed to change,
supplement or amend the Company Schedules or Parent Schedules, as applicable.

7.07 _Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, the
Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or requests for information with respect
to, or the making of, any inquiry regarding, or any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or

 



76

    

 could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to, any Person
relating to any proposal, offer, inquiry or request for information that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) furnish any non-public information regarding
the Company or its Subsidiaries or access to the properties, assets or
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person with respect to, or
the making of, any inquiry regarding, or any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal or request for information; (iv) approve, endorse
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal; (v) execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, confidentiality agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement executed in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.07(b)(i)_), merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
exchange agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement for or relating to any Acquisition
Proposal; (vi) submit any Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the
Company; or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ ,
that it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the
Company Board made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.07(b)_ or _Section_ __
_ 7.07(c)_ shall not be deemed to be a breach or violation of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.07(a)_. The Company also agrees that immediately following
the execution of this Agreement it shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their Representatives to, (i) cease any solicitations, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto and their
respective Representatives) conducted heretofore in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for information that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) terminate access to any physical or electronic data room maintained by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and instruct each Person
that has prior to the date hereof executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company to return or
destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof. The Company
shall promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24) hours) notify, in
writing, Parent of the receipt of any inquiry, proposal, offer or request for
information received after the date hereof that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any Acquisition Proposal,
which notice shall include a summary of the material terms of, and the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making, such inquiry, proposal,
offer or request for information and an unredacted copy of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer made in writing or, if, not
in writing, a written description of the material terms and conditions of
such inquiry, proposal or offer (and shall include any other documents
evidencing or specifying the terms of such inquiry, proposal, offer or
request). The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24)
hours) keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments with
respect to any such inquiry, proposal, offer, request for information or
Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes thereto and copies of any
additional written materials received by the Company, its subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow for
a confidential _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition
Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a
material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_) to be made to the 

 



77

    

 Company or the Company Board so long as the Company promptly (and in any
event within twenty four (24) hours thereafter) notifies Parent thereof after
granting any such waiver, amendment or release and the Company Board
determines prior to the grant of such waiver, amendment or release in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the
failure of the Company Board to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the restrictions contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.07_ by any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or any of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries respective Representatives acting on the
Companys or one (1) of its Subsidiaries behalf, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 7.07(a)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, this Agreement shall not prevent the Company or
the Company Board from:

 

(i) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, (A) contacting and
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person and its
Representatives who has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof that did not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _
7.07(a)_ and (B) providing access to the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries properties, books and records and providing information or data
in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
_Section_ __ _ 7.07(a)_, in each case, if the Company Board: (I) shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior
Proposal; (II) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (III) has received from
the Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall provide
to Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub any material non-public
information or data that is provided to any Person that was not previously
made available to Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereof);

 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, making a Company
Change in Recommendation (only to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _
7.07(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.07(d)_; or

 

(iii) resolving, authorizing, committing or agreeing to take any of the
foregoing actions, only to the extent such actions would be permitted by the
foregoing clauses "(i)" and "(ii)".

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, in response to a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_, that (i) such proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company or the Company Board may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite
Approval, make a Company Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the

 



78

    

 Company will not be entitled to make a Company Change in Recommendation
unless (I) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Company
Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board proposes to take such
action and containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the Company Board, and
(II) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business
Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00
p.m. New York City time on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice (it being
understood that any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a
new Superior Proposal and shall require a new notice but with an additional
three (3) Business Day (instead of four (4) Business Day) period from the
date of such notice), the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company Board reaffirms in
good faith (1) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal notwithstanding the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent (if any) were to be given effect and (2) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its or their Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ or  _Section_
__ _ 9.02(g)_ to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Approval, the Company Board determines in good faith, in response to
a Company Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board
may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Approval, make a Company Change
in Recommendation; _provided_ that the Company will not be entitled to make,
or agree or resolve to make, a Company Change in Recommendation unless (i) the
Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Company Intervening
Event Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board proposes to take such
action and containing the material facts underlying the Company Boards
determination that a Company Intervening Event has occurred, and (ii) at or
after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Intervening Event Notice (such period from the time the Company Intervening
Event Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fourth
(4th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company
delivered the Company Intervening Event Notice (it being understood that any
material development with respect to a Company Intervening Event shall require
a new notice but with an additional three (3) Business Day (instead of four
(4) Business Day) period from the date of such notice), the " _Company
Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), the Company Board reaffirms in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its or their Representatives to, during the Company Intervening
Event Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so as to obviate the need for a Company Change in Recommendation.

 



79

    

7.08 _Company Warrant Amendments_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall perform any and all of its obligations under each of the Company Warrant
Amendments and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the parties

ARTICLE VIII

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

8.01 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it shall
indemnify and hold harmless each current or former director or officer, as
the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, together with such
persons heirs, executors or administrators, a " _D andO Indemnified Party_")
(in each case, solely to the extent acting in their capacity as such and to
the extent such activities are related to the business of the Company being
acquired under this Agreement) against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
would have been permitted under applicable Law and its respective
organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such DandO Indemnified Parties (including the advancing of expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of each DandO Indemnified Party,
as provided in their respective organizational documents or in any
indemnification agreement with the Company or its Subsidiaries set forth on
_Schedule 8.01(a)_ shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force
and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the applicable
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
any DandO Indemnified Party as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification or advancement of
expenses in respect of any Actions pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ without
limit as to time.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a "tail" or "runoff"
directors and officers liability insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail_") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Person that is a director or officer of the

 



80

    

 Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries currently covered by a directors
and officers liability insurance policy of the Company or one or more of its
Subsidiaries on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement for the six (6) year period following the Closing. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain the DandO Tail in full force and
effect for its full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and no other party shall have
any further obligation to purchase or pay for such insurance pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_.

(c) The rights of each DandO Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have
under the organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, any Law or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries under
this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party without the consent
of such DandO Indemnified Party. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_
shall survive the Closing and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, each of whom is an
intended third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_.

(d) If Parent or, after the Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_.

8.02 _Conduct of Parent During the Interim Period_.

(a) During the Interim Period, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, except as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.02_, as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or as consented to by the Company in writing
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or
as may be required by Law, COVID-19 Measures or Social Unrest Measures, use
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and operate its business in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.02_ or
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as consented to by the Company
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or as may be required by Law, COVID-19 Measures or Social Unrest
Measures, Parent shall not and each shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to:

relating to the Trust Account), the Parent Organizational Documents or the
organizational documents of First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub, or form or
establish any other Subsidiary;

 

(ii) (A) make, declare, set aside or pay any dividends on, or make any
other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of any of
its outstanding capital stock or other equity interests; (B) split, combine,

81

    

 stock or other equity interests; (C) other than the redemption of any shares
of Parent Class A Stock required by the Offer or as otherwise required by
Parents Organizational Documents in order to consummate the Transactions,
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or offer to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, any capital stock of, or other equity interests in, Parent;
or (D) effect a recapitalization or issue or authorize the issuance of any
other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for any capital
stock or warrant, or effect any like change in capitalization.

 

(iii) other than as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.02(a)(iii)_, enter
into, renew or amend any Parent Affiliate Agreement (or any Contract, that if
existing on the date hereof, would have constitute a Parent Affiliate
Agreement);

 

(iv) enter into, or amend or modify any term of (in a manner adverse to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries)), terminate (excluding any expiration in
accordance with its terms), or waive or release any material rights, claims or
benefits under, any Contract of a type required to be listed on  _Schedule_
__ _ 6.16(a)_ (or any Contract, that if existing on the date hereof, would
have been required to be listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 6.16(a)_), or any Parent
Benefit Plan (or plan that would be a Parent Benefit Plan if in effect on the
date hereof) or collective bargaining or similar agreement (including
agreements with works councils and trade unions and side letters) to which
Parent or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound;

 

(v) waive, release, compromise, settle or satisfy any pending or threatened
claim (which shall include, but not be limited to, any pending or threatened

9.01 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant contained
in  _Article_ __ _ VII_ or _Article_ __ _ VIII_, or the obligations of the
Company and Parent with respect to the notifications, filings, reaffirmations
and applications described in  _Section_ __ _ 9.05_, which obligations shall
control to the extent of any conflict with the succeeding provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.01_, Parent and the Company shall each, and shall each cause
their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to
assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such

soon as practicable.

 

9.02 _Preparation of Registration Statement; Special Meeting_ _;
Solicitation of Company Requisite Approval_. 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent shall prepare, with the assistance of the Company, and
cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, and including the Proxy Statement
and the Consent Solicitation Statement contained therein, the " _Registration
Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
the Parent Class A Stock to be issued under this Agreement, which Registration
Statement will also contain the Proxy Statement and the Consent Solicitation
Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement and the
Consent Solicitation Statement to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
of the SEC or its staff, and to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Mergers. Each party shall furnish all information
concerning it as may reasonably be requested by the other party in
connection with such actions and the preparation of the Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement and the Consent Solicitation Statement.
Promptly after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act, Parent will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
stockholders of Parent.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and mutually agree upon
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), any
response to comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration
Statement and any amendment to the Registration Statement filed in
response thereto. If Parent or the Company becomes aware that any information
contained in the Registration Statement shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or that the Registration Statement is required to be
amended in order to comply with applicable Law, then (i) such party shall
promptly inform the other parties and (ii) Parent, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall cooperate and mutually agree upon (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement. Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the holders of shares of Parent Class A Stock, as applicable, in each case
pursuant to applicable Law and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Parent Organizational Documents. Each of the Company
and Parent shall provide the other parties with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform such other parties of any oral comments, that
Parent receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration
Statement promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give the
other parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
written or oral responses to such comments prior to responding to the SEC or
its staff.

 



86

    

(c) Parent agrees to include provisions in the Proxy Statement and to take
reasonable action related thereto, with respect to the: (i) approval of the
Business Combination (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) (the "
_Transaction Proposal_ "); (ii) approval of the Parent AandR Charter (the "
_Amendment Proposal_ ") and each change to the Parent AandR Charter that is
required to be separately approved; (iii) approval of the issuance of shares
of Parent Class A Stock and Parent Class B Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01_ under applicable Nasdaq rules (the " _Issuance Proposal_ "); (iv)
approval and adoption of Management Longer Term Equity Incentive Plan as
described in  _Section_ __ _ 9.06_ (the " _Management Longer Term Equity
Incentive Plan Proposal_ "); (v) approval and adoption of a customary equity
incentive plan (the " _Parent Omnibus Incentive Plan_ ") in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Parent
Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal_ "); (vi) the election of the members of the
board of directors of Parent in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.08_; and
(vii) approval of any other proposals reasonably agreed by Parent and the
Company to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the approval of an employee stock purchase
plan (the " _Additional Proposal_ " and, together with the Transaction
Proposal, the Amendment Proposal, the Issuance Proposal, the Management Longer
Term Equity Incentive Plan Proposal and the Parent Omnibus Incentive Plan
Proposal, the " _Proposals_ "). Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the Proposals shall be the only matters (other than procedural
matters) which Parent shall propose to be acted on by Parents stockholders
at the Special Meeting.

(d) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable: (i) establish the record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Special Meeting in accordance with the DGCL; (ii) cause
the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to Parents stockholders in compliance
with applicable Law, including the DGCL; and (iii) solicit proxies from the
holders of Parent Class A Stock to vote in accordance with the recommendation
of the Parent Board with respect to each of the Proposals. Parent shall,
through the Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders that they approve the
Proposals (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ ") and shall include the Parent
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, unless the Parent Board shall
have changed the recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.02(e)_.
Parent shall comply with Law and all legal requirements applicable to such
Special Meeting, including the DGCL, the Parent Organizational Documents and
the Exchange Act, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Parents
obligation to solicit proxies from Parents stockholders to vote in accordance
with the recommendation of the Parent Board with respect to each of the
Proposals pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_ shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by any development, including by any Parent Change in
Recommendation.

 

(e) The Parent Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof shall)
change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change,
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Parent Board Recommendation (a "
_Parent Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that in
response to a Parent Intervening Event, the failure to make a Parent Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Parent Board may, prior to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, make a Parent Change in Recommendation; _provided_
 that Parent will not be entitled to make, or agree or resolve to make, a
Parent Change in Recommendation unless (i) Parent delivers to the Company a
written notice (a " _Parent Intervening Event Notice_ ") 

 



87

    

 advising the Company that the Parent Board proposes to take such action and
containing the material facts underlying the Parent Boards determination that
a Parent Intervening Event has occurred, and (ii) at or after 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately following the day
on which Parent delivered the Parent Intervening Event Notice (such period
from the time the Parent Intervening Event Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m.
New York City time on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately following the
day on which Parent delivered the Parent Intervening Event Notice (it being
understood that any material development with respect to a Parent Intervening
Event shall require a new notice but with an additional three (3) Business Day
(instead of four (4) Business Day) period from the date of such notice), the
" _Parent Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), the Parent Board reaffirms in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor) that the failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by
the Company, Parent will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its or their Representatives to, during the Parent Intervening Event Notice
Period, engage in good faith negotiations with the Company and its
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so as to obviate the need for a Parent Change in Recommendation.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.02_,
if on a date for which the Special Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Class A
Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, Parent shall have the right to make postponements or adjournments of
the Special Meeting; _provided_ , that in the event of any postponement or
adjournment pursuant to the foregoing, the Special Meeting shall not be held
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Termination Date; _provided_
, _further_ , that Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting
more than three (3) times.

 

(g) The Company shall solicit the Company Requisite Approval via written
consent as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. In connection therewith, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable: (i) establish the
record date for determining the Company Stockholders entitled to provide such
written consent; (ii) cause the Consent Solicitation Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders in compliance with applicable Law,
including the DGCL; and (iii) solicit written consents from the Company
Stockholders to give the Company Requisite Approval. The Company shall,
through the Company Board, recommend to the Company Stockholders that they
adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Consent Solicitation
Statement, subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.02(g)_. The
Company Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof shall) (i)
change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change,
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation or
(ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clause "(i)" or "(ii)", a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ")
except in accordance with _Sections 7.07(c)_ and _7.07(d)_ ). The Company will
provide Parent with copies of all stockholder consents it receives within one
(1) Business Day of receipt. If the Company Requisite Approval is obtained,
then promptly following the receipt of the required written consents, the
Company will prepare and deliver to its stockholders who have not consented
the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL. Unless this Agreement has
been terminated

 



88

    

 in accordance with its terms, the Companys obligation to solicit written
consents from the Company Stockholders to give the Company Requisite Approval
in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.02(g)_ shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by any development, including the making, commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Proposal, or by any Company Change in Recommendation.

9.03 _Other Filings; Press Release_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, Parent
will prepare and file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange
Act to report the execution of this Agreement and the Transactions, the form
and substance of which shall be approved (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance in writing by the
Company.

(b) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall also issue a mutually agreed joint press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent shall prepare a draft Current Report on Form 8-K announcing

statements prepared by the Company and its accountant, and such other
information that may be required to be disclosed with respect to the
Transactions in any report or form to be filed with the SEC (" _Closing Form
8_ _-K_ "), the form and substance of which shall be approved (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance
in writing by the Company. Prior to Closing, Parent and the Company shall
prepare and mutually agreed upon a joint press release announcing the
consummation of the Transactions (" _Closing Press Release_ "). Concurrently
with the Closing, or as soon as practicable thereafter, Parent shall issue
the mutually agreed Closing Press Release. Concurrently with the Closing, or
as soon as practicable thereafter, Parent shall file the Closing Form
8-K with the SEC.

9.04 _Confidentiality; Communications Plan_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company acknowledge that they are parties to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Following Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
superseded in its entirety by the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate to create and
implement a communications plan regarding the Transactions (the "

consent of the Company, in the case of a public announcement by Parent, or
Parent, in the case of a public announcement by the Company (such consents,
in either case, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except: (i) if such announcement or other communication is required by
applicable Law, in which case the disclosing

 



89

    

 party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, first allow such
other parties to review such announcement or communication and have the
opportunity to comment thereon and the disclosing party shall consider such
comments in good faith; (ii) to the extent provided for in the Communications
Plan, internal announcements to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
(iii) subject to any other requirements or obligations of the parties set
forth in this Agreement, announcements and communications to Governmental
Authorities in connection with registrations, declarations and filings
relating to the Transactions required to be made under this Agreement, in

and the Company will each promptly furnish to the other such information and
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Laws and will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods or obtain the
applicable approvals as soon as practicable. Parent and the Company will
each promptly provide the other with copies of all substantive written
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of all substantive
oral communications) between each of them, any of their Affiliates and their
respective agents, representatives and advisors, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Company

and advisors, on one hand, and any such 

 



90

    

 Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case, with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of Parent and the Company may, as
they deem necessary, designate any sensitive materials to be exchanged in
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 9.05_ as "outside-counsel only." Any such
materials, as well as the information contained therein, shall be provided
only to a receiving partys outside counsel (and mutually-acknowledged
outside consultants) and not disclosed by such counsel (or consultants) to any
employees, officers, or directors of the receiving party without the advance
written consent of the party supplying such materials or information. Parent

including filing fees in connection with filings under the HSR Act. Parent,

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Payment or the Company
Tail Termination Payment on more than one (1) occasion. Each of the Company,
Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub acknowledges that the

Payment in the event of any termination of this Agreement, including in such
circumstances where the Company may be separately liable for payment of the
Company Termination Payment and the Company Tail Termination Payment pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 11.02(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.02(c)_.

Company Termination Payment (and no Acquisition Proposal is publicly
announced, disclosed or made and is not publicly withdrawn as of the date of
such termination) or the Company Tail Termination Payment pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 11.02_, the Company Termination Payment and the Company Tail
Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages for
any and all losses, damages or liabilities of any kind suffered by Parent and
its Affiliates and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, First
Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or any of the Parent Related Parties against the
Company or any other Company Related Party for any loss, damage or liability
suffered as a result of the failure of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach of, or
failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other document
delivered in connection herewith or otherwise in respect of any oral or
written representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or in respect of representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at Law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise. Upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Company Termination Payment is payable by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.02(c)_ (and no Acquisition Proposal is publicly
announced, disclosed or made and is not publicly withdrawn as of the date of
such termination) or the Company Tail Termination Payment is payable by the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.02(c)_ and, in each case, such Company
Termination Payment or Company Tail Termination Payment is paid in full, as
applicable, Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and any of the Parent
Related Parties shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Company
or any other Company Related Party, at law or in equity or otherwise, and
none of Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub or any of the Parent
Related Parties shall seek to obtain (or bring any action against the Company
or any other Company Related Party for) any recovery, judgment, or damages of
any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the
Company or any Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary and without limitation of the preceding sentence, following
payment by the Company to Parent of the Company Termination Payment (and no
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, disclosed or made and is not
publicly withdrawn as of the date of such termination) or the Company Tail
Termination Payment, as applicable, neither Parent nor its Affiliates will be
entitled to monetary damages for any loss or other liability of any kind
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Mergers or any other
Transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated in excess of the Company
Termination Payment (and no Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced,
disclosed or made and is not publicly withdrawn as of the date of such
termination) or the Company Tail Termination Payment, as applicable.

and Exhibits referenced herein are a part of this Agreement as if fully set

Exhibits shall be deemed references to such parts of this Agreement, unless
the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure made by a party in the
Company Schedules or the Parent Schedules with reference to any section or
schedule of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to
all other sections or schedules to which such disclosure may apply solely to

of the disclosure in such Company Schedule or Parent Schedule, as applicable.
Certain information set forth in the Company Schedules and the Parent
Schedules is included solely for informational purposes and the convenience of
Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable.
The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the

amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion
of any such item in the Company Schedules or Parent Schedules in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item, or
matter not described herein or included in Company Schedules or the Parent
Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. The inclusion
of any item in the Company Schedules or Parent Schedules shall not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment by the Company or Parent, as applicable, that

shall such disclosure be deemed (a) an admission of any breach or
violation of any Contract or Law, (b) an admission of any liability or
obligation to any third party, or (c) to establish a standard of materiality.
In addition, under no circumstances shall the disclosure of any matter in the
Company Schedules or Parent Schedules, where a representation or warranty of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, is limited or qualified by the
materiality of the matters to which the representation or warranty is given or
by Material Adverse Effect, imply that any other undisclosed matter having a

Adverse Effect, as applicable.

set forth or referenced in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements. 

12.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or
in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the parties shall not
restrict the ability of the board of directors of any of the parties to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ or to cause
such party to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 12.10_.

exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any
objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be
heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions

enforce judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 12.12_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this

performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
