The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared by Seller in good faith and delivered to Buyer, along with the calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount, Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated Closing Indebtedness, on a financial certificate (the " _Estimated Closing Financial Certificate_ ") no later than one (1) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

The aggregate addition or deduction to the Initial Cash Price resulting from the calculations set forth in clauses (b)-(d) shall be referred to as the " _Estimated Overall Purchase Price Adjustment_ " and the final aggregate calculation of such amounts pursuant to Section 2.2 shall be referred to as the " _Final Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment_ ".

The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the principles and methodologies set forth in Section 2.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (which such principles and methodologies are in accordance with GAAP (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Company Financial Statements), and the Final Adjustment Amount, Final 

     ##### 

 

  

Closing Cash and Final Closing Indebtedness derived therefrom shall be
prepared in accordance with the illustrative calculations thereof set forth
in Section 2.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Buyer shall, in a timely
manner, provide Seller such data and information as Seller may
reasonably request in writing in connection with the preparation and review
of the Final Closing Financial Certificate; provided, that such information
right shall not include any access to documents to the extent prepared in
defense of an Action concerning the Final Closing Financial Statement or
the calculation of the Final Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment. 

   

 (b) The Final Closing Financial Certificate shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the date (the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") that is thirty (30) days following receipt thereof by Seller unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement (" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such date; provided, that all such items that are not disputed shall be final and binding upon the Parties. In order to be effective, a Notice of Disagreement must specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the Final Closing Financial Certificate (as revised in accordance with paragraph (d) below, if applicable) shall become final and binding on the Parties on, and the Final Settlement Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the date upon which Seller and Buyer agree in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date upon which the Final Closing Financial Certificate is issued by the Neutral Arbitrator. 

   

 (c) During the first twenty (20) days following the date upon which Buyer receives a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such twenty (20) day period (or earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate) Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement on such matters, the matters that remain in dispute shall be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator by the Parties for review and resolution. The terms of appointment and engagement of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be as agreed upon in good faith between the Parties and any associated engagement fees shall initially be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer;  _provided_ , that such fees shall ultimately be allocated in accordance with the fee sharing provisions set forth below in this Section 2.2(c). The hearing date will be scheduled by the Neutral Arbitrator as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall be conducted on a confidential basis. Each Party shall, not later than seven (7) days prior to the hearing date set by the Neutral Arbitrator, submit a brief (to include such Partys calculations with regard to amounts in dispute on the Closing Statement) for settlement of any amounts set forth in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Neutral Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in dispute on the basis of the standards set forth in this Section 2.2 (which decision shall include a written statement of findings and conclusions) within ten (10) Business Days after the conclusion of the hearing, unless the Parties reach agreement prior thereto and withdraw the dispute from arbitration; provided, that the Neutral Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any disputed item greater than the greatest value for such item assigned to it by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned to it by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be. The Neutral Arbitrator shall provide to the Parties explanations in writing of the reasons for its decisions regarding the Final Adjustment Amount, Final Closing Cash and Final Closing Indebtedness and shall issue the Final Closing Financial Certificate reflecting such decisions. The decision of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties. If the Neutral Arbitrator resolves all disputes presented to it entirely in 

   ##### 

  

   

the manner proposed by either Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, the fees
and expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be borne by the non-prevailing
Party. In all other events, the fees and expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator
shall be shared based on the difference between Sellers position, on the one
hand, and Buyers position, on the other hand, initially presented to the
Neutral Arbitrator (based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a
whole) and the final resolution as determined by the Neutral Arbitrator in
proportion to the total difference between Sellers and Buyers
initial positions. The fees and disbursements of Buyers independent public
accountants incurred in connection with the procedures performed with respect
to the Final Closing Financial Certificate shall be borne by Buyer and the
fees and disbursements of Sellers independent public accountants incurred in
connection with their preparation of the Notice of Disagreement shall be borne
by Seller. 

   

 (d) (i) If the Final Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment as derived from the Final Closing Financial Certificate is less than the Estimated Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment, the Closing Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to such excess of the Estimated Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment over the Final Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment as derived from the Final Closing Financial Certificate (" _Shortfall Reduction_ ") and (ii) if the Final Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment as derived from the Final Closing Financial Certificate is greater than the Estimated Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment, the Closing Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to such excess of the Final Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment as derived from the Final Closing Financial Certificate over the Estimated Overall Cash Purchase Price Adjustment (" _Excess Payment_ "). 

   

 (e) Any Shortfall Reduction or Excess Payment described in clause (i) or (ii) in Section 2.2(d) shall be paid to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, not later than three (3) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts specified by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, and shall be considered an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price. The amount of any Shortfall Reduction or Excess Payment to be made after the Closing Date pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the Closing Date. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed. 

   

 2.3 _Earnout Amounts_. 

  

 (a) As additional consideration for the Shares, Seller shall be entitled, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.3, to the Earnout Amounts. 

   

 (b) Buyer shall deliver to Seller within forty-five (45) days of the end of each of the fiscal years included in the Earnout Period (each such date of delivery, a " _Delivery Date_ "): (i) a worksheet setting forth, in reasonable detail, the calculation of the 2010 Earnout Amount, 2011 Earnout Amount or 2012 Earnout Amount, as applicable, including all necessary back-up calculations, each such worksheet to use the methodology used in determining the Gross Profit Threshold as set forth in Section 1.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each such statement, an " _Earnout Statement_ "); and (ii) the 2010 Earnout Amount, the 2011 Earnout 

    ##### 

  

  

Amount or the 2012 Earnout Amount, as applicable, set forth on the Earnout
Statement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account

provide Seller such data and information as Seller may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation and review of each Earnout Statement. 

  

 (c) The applicable Earnout Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the date (the " _Earnout Final Settlement Date_ ") that is thirty (30) days following receipt thereof by Seller unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement (" _Earnout Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such date; provided, that all such items that are not disputed shall be final and binding upon the Parties; provided further, that Seller may retain the 2010 Earnout Amount, the 2011 Earnout Amount or the 2012 Earnout Amount, as applicable, delivered by Buyer in connection with the applicable Earnout Statement in the event it delivers an Earnout Notice of Disagreement (the " _Retained Earnout Amount_ "). In order to be effective, an Earnout Notice of Disagreement must specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If an Earnout Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the applicable Earnout Statement (as revised in accordance with paragraph (d) below, if applicable) shall become final and binding on the Parties on, and the Earnout Final Settlement Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the date upon which Seller and Buyer agree in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Earnout Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date upon which the final applicable Earnout Statement is issued by the Neutral Arbitrator. 

  

 (d) During the first twenty (20) days following the date upon which Buyer receives an Earnout Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to all matters specified in the Earnout Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such twenty (20) day period (or earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate) Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement on such matters, the matters that remain in dispute shall be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator by the Parties for review and resolution. The terms of appointment and engagement of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be as agreed upon in good faith between the Parties and any associated engagement fees shall initially be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer; _provided_ , that such fees shall ultimately be allocated in accordance with the fee sharing provisions set forth below in this Section 2.3(d). The hearing date will be scheduled by the Neutral Arbitrator as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall be conducted on a confidential basis. Each Party shall, not later than seven (7) days prior to the hearing date set by the Neutral Arbitrator, submit a brief (to include such Partys calculations with regard to amounts in dispute on the Earnout Statement) for settlement of any amounts set forth in the Earnout Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Neutral Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in dispute on the basis of the standards set forth in this Section 2.3 (which decision shall include a written statement of findings and conclusions) within ten (10) Business Days after the conclusion of the hearing, unless the Parties reach agreement prior thereto and withdraw the dispute from arbitration; provided, that the Neutral Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any disputed item greater than the greatest value for such item assigned to it by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned to it by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be. The Neutral Arbitrator shall provide to the Parties explanations in writing of the reasons for its decisions regarding the Earnout Statement and shall issue a final Earnout Statement reflecting such decisions. The decision of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be final and 

   ##### 

  

   

binding on the Parties. If the Neutral Arbitrator resolves all disputes
presented to it entirely in the manner proposed by either Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, the fees and expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be
borne by the non-prevailing Party. In all other events, the fees and
expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be shared based on the difference
between Sellers position, on the one hand, and Buyers position, on the
other hand, initially presented to the Neutral Arbitrator (based on the
aggregate of all differences taken as a whole) and the final resolution as
determined by the Neutral Arbitrator in proportion to the total difference
between Sellers and Buyers initial positions. Buyer shall pay the 2010
Earnout Amount, the 2011 Earnout Amount or the 2012 Earnout Amount, as
applicable and as finally determined, if any, less the Retained Earnout
Amount, to Seller within five business days after Sellers acceptance of, or
the final resolution of, such amount, plus interest thereon from the
applicable Delivery Date at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the
Closing Date. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment
to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of
365 days and the actual number of days elapsed. Any Earnout Amounts paid by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be considered adjustments to
the Purchase Price. 

   

 (e) Buyer agrees and covenants, for itself, its Subsidiaries and any other Person in which it holds, directly or indirectly, controlling Equity Interests, that during the period from the Closing Date until the conclusion of the Earnout Period, (i) Buyer will operate the Company in good faith and, subject to Buyers reasonable commercial judgment, will not take any action that would reasonably be expected to reduce Gross Profits, (ii) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to (A) engage in activities or transactions that would reasonably be expected to defer the receipt or recognition of revenue or accelerate the payment or recognition of expenses taken into account in calculating the Earnout Amounts, or (B) take any actions that would reasonably be expected to reduce the sales of any Alternate Site Products, (iii) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, transfer or sell any of the Alternate Site Products to any Affiliate of Buyer (or any third Person) during the Earnout Period unless the terms and conditions related to such transaction are at least as favorable to the Company as those which could be obtained in an arms-length transaction, (iv) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any regulatory approvals required in respect of Alternate Site Products and to Commercially Launch such Alternate Site Products promptly upon receipt of such regulatory approvals, (v) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to take any actions with respect to the manner or location of the manufacture or production of the Alternate Site Products which would reasonably be expected to increase the costs of such manufacture or production, (vi) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue ongoing discussions with the parties set forth on Section 2.3(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for the distribution of InRythm and MyRythm products and shall designate at least $200,000 in the aggregate to promote the Alternate Site Products, (vii) Buyer shall designate at least $150,000 in the aggregate for the marketing of MyRythm products in connection with Commercially Launching such products, and (viii) Buyer shall increase the number of dedicated salespeople for the Alternate Site Products by one (1) following the Companys receipt of 510(k) Clearance with respect to the InRythm products, by an additional two (2) following the Companys receipt of 510(k) Clearance with respect to the MyRythm products and by an additional two (2) following the Companys receipt of all CLIA Waivers with respect to the InRythm and MyRythm products. During the period from the Closing Date until the conclusion of the Earnout Period, neither

    ##### 

  

    

Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall market any products that directly
compete with the Alternate Site Products in the Territory (the " _Competing
Products_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be restricted by the provisions of this Section 2.3(e)
from selling or marketing the AQT 90 product (or any future systems, products
or platforms similar to the AQT 90 Product) or any other multi-test platform
product that includes prothrombin testing among other testing parameters.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.3(e),
neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be prohibited from acquiring
(whether through a purchase of stock or assets, through a merger or
consolidation, or otherwise) any Person (each, an " _Acquired Entity_ ") so
long as: (X) if such Acquired Entity sells Competing Products and such
Acquired Entity derives ten million dollars or less of gross revenues (as
measured from the conclusion of such Acquired Entitys last completed
fiscal year) from the sale of such Competing Products, Buyer shall provide
written notice to Seller of such fact (the " _Section 2.3(e)(X) Notice_")
and Buyer shall take one (and only one) of the following actions (as
determined by Buyer in its sole discretion): (i) divest, as soon
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within twelve months of Sellers
receipt of the Section 2.3(e)(X) Notice), the business of such Acquired
Entity that engages in the sale of Competing Products and hold such business
"Separate" from the Company during the period prior to such divestiture, (ii)
elect to pay to Seller an amount that represents the expected Earnout
Amount required to be paid by Buyer to Seller under this Section 2.3 for the
remaining portion of the Earnout Period as of the time of Buyers election
(the " _Earnout Payoff Amount_ "), as mutually agreed between Buyer and
Seller at the time of such election (or, if applicable, as determined by the
Neutral Arbitrator) or (iii) operate the business of such Person that engages
in the sale of Competing Products " _Separate_ " from the Company, which, for
purposes of this Section 2.3(e), shall be defined as (a) operating such
business as an entity that has a separate legal existence from the Company,
(b) taking all reasonable steps to ensure that all Confidential Information
of the Company is not shared with, or otherwise disclosed to, any employees of
such business, (c) employing an operating team to manage such business that
is separate from the Companys operating team, (d) prohibiting employees of
the Company from working for, or otherwise providing services to, such
business, and (e) prohibiting employees of such business from working for, or
otherwise providing services to, the Company; or (Y) if such Acquired Entity
sells Competing Products and such Acquired Entity derives more than ten
million dollars of gross revenues (as measured from the conclusion of such
Acquired Entitys last completed fiscal year) from the sale of such Competing
Products, Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller of such fact (the "
_Section 2.3(e)(Y) Notice_") and Buyer shall, at its sole option, either
(i) divest, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within twelve
months of Sellers receipt of the Section 2.3(e)(Y) Notice), the business of
such Acquired Entity that engages in the sale of Competing Products and hold
such business "Separate" from the Company during the period prior to such
divestiture or (ii) elect to pay to Seller the Earnout Payoff Amount, as
mutually agreed between Buyer and Seller at the time of such election (or, if
applicable, as determined by the Neutral Arbitrator). If Buyer and Seller are
unable to reach agreement on the Earnout Payoff Amount (such items in dispute
being herein referred to as the " _Disputed Items_ "), the Disputed Items
shall be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within 30 days of Sellers
receipt of the Section 2.3(e)(X) Notice or the Section 2.3(e)(Y) Notice (as
applicable) and the dispute procedures set forth in Section 2.3(d) above
shall govern the Parties respective rights and obligations with respect to
resolving such Disputed Items. In no event shall the Earnout Payoff Amount
exceed the applicable Sale Transaction Amount. Upon the payment of 

  ##### 

  

   

the Earnout Payoff Amount in full, no Party shall have any further
obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Section 2.3. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.3(e): (I) Buyers
obligation to use "commercially reasonable efforts" in complying with this
Section 2.3(e) shall not require Buyer to continue to sell an Alternate Site
Product if there is any product recall or product discontinuation implemented
by the Company with respect to such Alternate Site Product;  _provided_ ,
that such recall or discontinuation (a) is required by any actual or proposed
(in writing) injunction, judgment, decree, order or other Action of any
Government Authority or (b) is effected in response to or settlement of (i)
any actual or proposed (in writing) Action, fine, penalty, sanction, or other
adverse consequence imposed by any Government Authority with respect to such
Alternate Site Product or (ii) a good faith determination by the Company that
such Alternate Site Product does not provide the results intended by its
design to an extent that the Company determines that such Alternate Site
Product, unless recalled or discontinued, may substantially compromise
patient safety; and (II) Buyer shall only be obligated to develop, market and
sell any Alternate Site Product to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the FDA and any other Governmental Authorities. 

   

 (f) Buyer shall allow an independent accounting firm selected by Seller, not more than once during any fiscal year during the Earnout Period (and for 180 days following the conclusion of the Earnout Period) and only upon prior written notice to Buyer, to inspect, at Sellers sole cost and expense, Buyers books, records, agreements and other documents reasonably requested by Seller relating to the Alternate Site Products in order to ensure Buyers compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Buyer shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 2.3(f) which could reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, and (ii) Buyer need not supply Seller with any access or information which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is under a legal obligation not to supply. Buyer shall also provide Seller, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each of the first, second and third fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of the Earnout Period, a non-binding calculation of the Gross Profit for such quarter, determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 1.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; provided, that the failure by Seller to contest or respond to such calculation of Gross Profit shall in no way affect or prejudice any of Sellers rights pursuant to this Section 2.3. 

   

 (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as a restriction or limitation on the Company and its Affiliates right and ability to acquire by purchase, exchange, or otherwise, any other Person, whether or not engaged in a business similar or related to the business of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.3(e) governing the acquisition of an Acquired Entity. 

   

 (h) In the event that a Sale Transaction occurs prior to the conclusion of the Earnout Period, Buyer shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated date of the consummation of such Sale Transaction, deliver written notice of such Sale Transaction to Seller (such notice, the " _Sale Notice_ "). On the date of the consummation of such Sale Transaction, Buyer shall pay to Seller: (i) $25,688,000 if such Sale Transaction occurs during the 2010 Earnout Period; (ii) $24,411,000 (plus all of the 2010 Earnout Amounts, if any, due and not yet paid to Seller) multiplied by the 510(k) Percentage if such Sale Transaction occurs during the 2011 Earnout Period; and (iii) $14,648,000 (plus all of the 2010 Earnout Amounts 

   ##### 

  

   

and the 2011 Earnout Amounts, in each case if any, due and not yet paid to
Seller at time of the consummation of such Sale Transaction) multiplied by
the 510(k) Percentage if such Sale Transaction occurs during the 2012 Earnout
Period. Upon the payment by Buyer of the applicable amount to Seller in
accordance with the preceding sentence, no Party shall have any further
obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Section 2.3. In the event of any
sale of a material portion of the assets of the Company related to the
product line for the Alternate Site Products in a transaction that does not
qualify as a Sale Transaction, Buyer shall cause the purchaser in such
transaction to assume (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) the relevant
portion of the obligations of Buyer set forth in this Section 2.3 and
the Gross Profits attributable to sales of Alternate Site Products by such
purchaser shall be included in the calculation of Gross Profits for purposes
of determining the Earnout Amounts. 

   

 (i) Buyer has the right to set-off any amounts owed by Seller to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX against any amount payable to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.3. To the extent any amounts set-off pursuant to the preceding sentence are finally determined pursuant to Article IX to not be owed by Seller to such Buyer Indemnified Party, Buyer shall promptly pay Seller such amounts, including interest accruing thereon from the original due date of such payment to the date of payment at a rate equal to the Prime Rate. 

   

 (j) Buyer shall have the right to withhold amounts for Taxes as required by Law from any payments made to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.3 if Seller has failed to provide Buyer with an appropriate certificate or document prescribed by the United States Internal Revenue Service certifying Sellers entitlement to, exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, withholding for Taxes. Buyer shall not be required to gross-up any such payment to Seller as a result of any withholding pursuant to this Section 2.3(j).

Any information furnished to Buyer or which Buyer receives in exercising its rights pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be subject to the terms of Section 6.5 hereof; provided, however, that (a) any such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of Sellers business, (b) Seller shall not be required to take any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege if Seller determines in good faith that any requested disclosure would cause any such waiver, and (c) Seller need not supply Buyer with any access or information which Seller is under a legal obligation not to supply if Seller determines in good faith that any requested disclosure would cause a breach of such legal obligation; provided, that in the case of the foregoing clauses (b) and (c), Seller shall provide Buyer with details regarding the type and nature of the information that is prohibited from being disclosed (to the extent that Seller is able to provide such details without compromising such attorney-client privilege or violating such legal obligation).

Seller shall then 

   #####

shall commence and perform its actions promptly and without delay; (II)
Seller shall not unreasonably interfere with Buyers operations at the
Company Real Property; (III) Seller shall keep Buyer apprised of its actions
and shall share draft and final copies of reports and filings; and (IV)

Licensed Site Remediation Professional, who shall in good faith take into
consideration the comments of Buyer. Seller shall indemnify Buyer with respect
to any Losses relating to or arising from the activities of Seller or its
agents or contractors related to its obligations as set forth in this Section
6.3(e). 

  

 6.4 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to each Company employee rates of base salary or wages and annual bonus opportunities, benefits and benefit plans, programs and policies (including severance benefits, medical and welfare plans) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by Buyer to similarly situated employees of Buyer immediately prior to the Closing (other than equity or equity-related benefits, any defined benefit pension plan, or any nonqualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement). 

  

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.4, as of the Closing Date, the Seller and the Company shall take such action as is necessary such that the Company shall cease being a "participating employer" and shall cease any co-sponsorship and participation in each Benefit Plan that is not a Company Benefit Plan (each such Benefit Plan being a " _Seller Plan_ "). The Company shall have no further Liability and the Seller shall retain all Liabilities for Claims incurred under any Seller Plan (as determined under the terms of the Seller Plans), whether such Claims are incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall provide under the Seller Plans any continuation coverage required under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable state Law (" _COBRA_ ") to each "qualified beneficiary" 

   ##### 

  

    

as that term is defined in COBRA whose first "qualifying event" (as defined
in COBRA) occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) With respect to each employee benefit plan of Buyer or any Subsidiary thereof (each a " _Buyer Plan_ "), in which Company employees subsequently participate, for purposes of determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service with the Company (or predecessor employers thereof) shall be treated as service with the Person providing such Buyer Plan to the extent such service was taken into account under any substantially similar plan in which any such Company participated immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent permitted by each Buyer Plan, such Buyer Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements to the same extent such limitations or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such Company employee immediately prior to the Closing under the analogous Benefit Plan in which such Company employee participated. To the extent permitted by each Buyer Plan, Company employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Benefit Plan during the plan year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Buyer Plan for the plan year in which the Closing occurs. 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall create any third party beneficiary right in any Person other than the Parties, including any current or former Company employee, any participant in any Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment with Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan, Buyer Plan or any other plan or arrangement covering Company employees and nothing in this Section 6.4 shall limit the ability of Buyer or its Affiliates from amending the terms of, or terminating, any Benefit Plan, Buyer Plan or any other plan or arrangement covering Company employees pursuant to the terms of such plan or arrangement. The Company and Buyer shall each cooperate with the other and shall provide to the other such documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 6.4. 

  

 (e) As of the Closing Date, any separation benefits or severance plans maintained by the Seller or the Company covering or otherwise applicable to any active employees of the Company (which such separation benefits or severance plans are listed on Section 6.4(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) shall be assumed and adopted by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, without any further action on the part of the Parties, it being understood and agreed that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of Buyer or its Affiliates from amending the terms of, or terminating, any such plan, program or arrangement pursuant to the terms of such plan, program or arrangement. 

  

 (f) As of the Closing Date, (i) any employment agreement by and between Seller or the Company and any active employee of the Company (all of such employment agreements are listed on Section 6.4(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) shall be assumed and adopted by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, without any further action on the part of the Parties and (ii) any employment agreement by and between any Seller employee who performs 

   ##### 

  

    

functions for and provides substantially all services to the Company (all of
such employment agreements are listed on Section 6.4(f) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule) shall be assigned to the Company immediately prior to
Closing and such employment agreement shall be assumed and adopted by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement, without any further action on the part of the
Parties; provided, further, that with regard to such employment agreement
contemplated by this Section 6.4(f), the definition of "Company" shall include
any successors of the Company. 

  

 6.5 _Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) Each Party agrees that it shall not use any Confidential Information of any other Party or its Affiliates for any purpose other than in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not consummated. The receiving Party will safeguard the Confidential Information against disclosure by employing the same means to protect the Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own non-public, confidential or proprietary information. Each Party further agrees that it shall not divulge any such Confidential Information to any Person except (i) to its employees, agents, lenders, financial and other advisors and Representatives to the extent required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to the extent provided in the next sentence, as required to comply with deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process and (iii) as otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing. In the event that a Party becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such Party shall (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) give the other Party prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that they may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Section 6.5. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Party waives compliance with the terms of this Section 6.5, the receiving Party agrees to provide only that limited portion of the Confidential Information that it is advised by counsel is legally required and to exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. Each Party shall inform its employees, agents, lenders, financial and other advisors and Representatives of the confidential nature of such information and the obligation to keep such information confidential, and shall take such other action as shall be reasonably required to cause such information to be kept confidential. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Confidential Information_ " shall mean any non-public, confidential or proprietary information, including any information relating to any Party or its Affiliates properties or operations; provided, however, that Confidential Information shall not include any information if: 

   

 (i) such information at the time of the disclosure or thereafter is generally available to the public (other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving Party in violation of its confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 6.5); 

   

 (ii) such information was available to the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the other Party; provided, however that such source was not known by the receiving Party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or a duty of confidentiality that protected the Confidential Information; or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) such information has been independently acquired or developed without use of Confidential Information by the receiving Party without violating any of its confidentiality obligations hereunder. 

  

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, if requested by any Party, the other Party shall either promptly return or destroy the Confidential Information and all copies or other reproductions thereof, and all letters, notes and reports thereof, and all other materials, derived from the Confidential Information which are in such Partys control, provided that each Party (i) may retain any Confidential Information contained in an archived computer system backup in accordance with such Partys security and/or disaster recovery procedures and (ii) may retains copies of any Confidential Information prepared for archival or record retention purposes, where in each case, such information will remain subject to the provisions of this Section 6.5. The receiving Party agrees to represent in writing to the other Party that it has complied with the provisions of this paragraph. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following Closing, (i) Buyer shall not be prohibited from disclosing to any Person any information relating to the Company, its business or any Assets and (ii) with respect to Seller, the confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 6.5 shall apply to any Confidential Information that Seller has that relates to the Company, its business or any Assets. 

  

 6.6 _Public Announcements_. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of each stock exchange upon which the securities of a Party (or an Affiliate of such Party) are listed (and then only after consultation with Buyer or Seller, as applicable), none of the Parties will issue any press release or make any other public announcements concerning the transactions contemplated hereby or the contents of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties. If and to the extent that the terms set forth in this Section 6.6 conflict with the terms of Section 6.5, the terms set forth in this Section 6.6 shall control.

 6.8 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Competition Period_ "), Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and any other Person in which it holds, directly or indirectly, controlling Equity Interests (such Persons, including their respective successors or assigns, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Restricted Parties_ "), not to, directly or indirectly, form, own, manage, operate, join, control or participate (whether as a partner, agent, representative, or otherwise) in the ownership, management, operation or control of any Person in any territory in which the Company operates immediately prior to Closing or has taken reasonable measures as of the Closing Date to begin operating (the " _Territory_ "), that, directly or indirectly competes with the business of the Company as it shall exist immediately prior to the Closing Date (including only changes or expansions in the business of the Company or the products sold or distributed by the Company that are expressly contemplated as of the Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Alternate Site Products)) (a " _Competing Business_ "). In addition, during the Non-Competition Period, neither Seller nor any Restricted Party shall have, without Buyers prior written consent, any direct or indirect equity ownership in any such Person, other than as an owner of 2% or less of the outstanding stock of a publicly traded corporation. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller and the Restricted Parties shall not be restricted by the provisions of this Section 6.8 from acquiring (whether through a purchase of stock or assets, through a merger or consolidation, or otherwise) any Person that derives less than ten percent (10%) and less than $25,000,000 of its gross revenues (as measured from the conclusion of each of such Persons last three completed fiscal years) from any Competing Businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that following an acquisition permitted by this sentence, if such acquired Person derives more than twelve percent (12%) or more than $30,000,000 of its gross revenues from any Competing Businesses during any fiscal year that ends during the Non-Competition Period, Seller or such Restricted Party (as applicable) shall promptly provide written notice to Buyer of such fact and shall divest, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within twelve months of providing such notice), a portion of the business of such Person that engages in Competing Businesses such that less than twelve percent (12%) and less than $30,000,000 of such Persons gross revenues would be derived from Competing Businesses during the remainder of the Non-Competition Period. Seller shall keep Buyer informed, on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail, of the status of Sellers efforts to divest such business (or portion thereof) in accordance with the preceding proviso and Buyer shall have the right to participate as a potential purchaser in the sale process for such business (or portion thereof) on terms at least as favorable to those being offered to other participants in the sale process. 

  

 (b) Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of the Restricted Parties not to, directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of any Person, (i) solicit for employment or hire any Company employee; provided, however that any such employee may seek employment with the applicable Person in response to a general advertisement not directed at such employee and the applicable Person may hire any employee who responds to such general advertisement; (ii) approach any supplier or licensee of the Company with respect to products or services it provided to the Company at any time during the 

   ##### 

  

    

twelve-month period prior to the Closing with the intention of harming the
business or operations of the Company by causing such Person to decrease or
cease doing business with the Company; or (iii) approach any Person who is a
customer of the Company at any time during the twelve-month period prior to
the Closing with the intention of harming the business or operations of the
Company by causing such Person to purchase the products of any business
competitive with the Company. 

  

 (c) Seller acknowledges that the provisions set forth in this Section 6.8 are an integral part of the success of the Company throughout the Territory. If, on or after the Closing Date, Seller or any Restricted Party utilizes its reputation and goodwill in competition with Buyer, Buyer will be deprived of the benefits it has bargained for pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that the agreements in this Section 6.8 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of extending for too great a time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of it being too extensive in any other respect, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action. 

  

 (d) If Seller or any Restricted Party breaches or threatens to commit a breach of any of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 6.8, then the Company and Buyer shall each have the following rights and remedies against Seller or such Restricted Party, each of which shall be independent of the others and severally enforceable, and each of the following rights and remedies is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies otherwise available to any of them at Law or in equity: the right and remedy to have the restrictive covenants in this Section 6.8 specifically enforced against the Seller or such Restricted Party, including temporary restraining orders and injunctions by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed by Seller that any breach or threatened breach by Seller or any Restricted Party of this Section 6.8 would cause irreparable injury to the Company and Buyer and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to the Company or Buyer. 

  

 (e) Each of Seller and Buyer intends that the covenants set forth in Sections 6.8(a) and 6.8(b) shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each county or province of each and every state, territory or jurisdiction within the Territory, and one for each month of the time periods covered by such covenants. 

  

 (f) Seller hereby agrees that in the event a court of competent jurisdiction declares there has been a breach by Seller or any Restricted Party of Section 6.8(a) or Section 6.8(b), the term of any such covenant so breached shall be automatically extended beyond its intended expiration for a period of time equal to the duration of such breach. 

  

 (g) Seller shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6.8 by any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person in which Seller holds, directly or indirectly, controlling Equity Interests. 

  

 6.9 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, all Contracts of any kind (except for Contracts for the payment of wages, salaries, bonuses or other compensation to 

   ##### 

  

    

officers or directors of the Company for services performed in the ordinary
course of business (all of which are set forth on Section 4.23 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule)) between Seller, any of Sellers Subsidiaries, any other
Person in which Seller holds, directly or indirectly, controlling
Equity Interests (other than the Company) or any of their respective
directors or officers, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
will be terminated without any payment by, Liability of or cost to Buyer or
any Affiliate thereof, including the Company, following the Closing. A copy
of any fully executed termination agreement entered into in accordance with
the preceding sentence will be provided by Seller to Buyer prior to or at the
Closing. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall settle in Cash all receivables or
payables, loans or other amounts due or owed which are existing and
outstanding at any time prior to the Closing between Seller, any of Sellers
Subsidiaries, any other Person in which Seller holds, directly or indirectly,
controlling Equity Interests (other than the Company) or any of their
respective directors or officers, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand. 

  

 6.10 _Insurance_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing insurance to the Company for any event or occurrence after the Closing. Without limiting the rights of Buyer set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, if any Claims may reasonably be made, or if Losses have occurred prior to the Closing Date that relate to the Company, and such Claims may be made against insurance policies retained by Seller or its Affiliates, then Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) shall, at Buyers request and at Buyers sole cost and expense, use its reasonable best efforts in an effort to permit Buyer (after the Closing Date and in cooperation with Seller) to file, notice and otherwise continue to pursue such Claims and recover proceeds under the terms of such policies, and, subject to all of the foregoing, Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) agrees (at Buyers sole cost and expense) to otherwise reasonably cooperate with Buyer or its Affiliates to make the benefits of any such insurance policies available to Buyer or its Affiliates.

From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Seller will deliver to Buyer the form of unaudited financial statements of the Company set forth in Section 6.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for each fiscal month ended after January 2, 2010 (collectively, the " _Interim Financial Information_ ") within twenty (20) days after the conclusion of such month.

 6.12 _Cooperation; Financial Reporting; Transition Services_. 

  

 (a) Buyer agrees to furnish or cause to be furnished, upon written request, information and assistance of employees relating to the pre-Closing operation of the business of the Company as is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Seller in order for Seller (i) to satisfy on a timely basis its financial reporting obligations related to the Company pursuant to the Exchange Act until the date of filing of Sellers 10-K for the 2010 fiscal year of Seller and (ii) from the date of filing of Sellers 10-K for the 2010 fiscal year of Seller until two (2) years from such date, to satisfy any other legitimate legal obligation (as determined by Seller in good faith) or financial reporting obligation of Seller relating to the pre-Closing operation of the business of the Company and identified to Buyer in writing. The obligations of Buyer pursuant to clause (i) above shall include access at reasonable times within normal business hours to all books and records of the Company relating to the pre-Closing operation of the business of the 

    ##### 

 

  

Company as may be reasonably requested by Seller and the assistance of all
personnel of the Company, who, in the ordinary course of business of the
Company as of the date hereof, perform services or otherwise aid Seller with
respect to such reporting obligations; provided, that in no event shall such
access or assistance unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
Companys business or the duties of such personnel to the Company. The
obligations of Buyer pursuant to clause (ii) above shall include access at
reasonable times within normal business hours to the specific books and
records of the Company required for the purpose specified by Seller in
its request for such services and the assistance of certain personnel of the
Company to be mutually agreed between Buyer and Seller; provided, that in no
event shall such access or assistance unreasonably interfere with the
operation of the Companys business or the duties of such personnel to the
Company. Buyer shall be obligated to provide the services set forth in clauses
(i) and (ii) at a cost to Seller consistent with the hourly rates of the
employees performing such services (or, if such employees are salaried
employees, at a reasonable approximation of such employees per hour salary)
and Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Buyer in providing such services. For the avoidance of doubt, cooperation
obligations related to Taxes are addressed solely in Section 10.4. In no
event shall Buyer or the Company have any Liability in respect of any
reasonable act or omission of any employee of the Company with respect to
the performance of the services contemplated by this Section 6.12. All
Confidential Information of either Party of which the other Party becomes
aware during the provision of the services contemplated by this Section 6.12
shall be treated in accordance with Section 6.5. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (A) Buyer shall not be required to take any
action pursuant to this Section 6.12 if there is a legitimate business reason
for not taking such action, as determined in good faith by Buyer, and (B)
Buyer need not supply Seller with any access or information which Buyer or
any of its Affiliates is under a legal obligation not to supply. 

   

 (b) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, the Parties will work in good faith and reasonably cooperate with each other to negotiate and finalize a Transition Services Agreement (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ ").

The Parties agree to consider in good faith any changes to the terms described in the foregoing sentence due to any change in facts or circumstances discovered after the date hereof. 

   

 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall give reasonably prompt notice to the other Party of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the 

   ##### 

  

    

occurrence or non-occurrence of which would or would be reasonably likely to
cause any representation or warranty of the applicable Party contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time at or prior to
the Closing, or which, individually or in the aggregate, could result in a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any event which would reasonably be expected to
cause any of the conditions in Article VII or Article VIII, as applicable,
not to be satisfied, and (iii) any material failure of the applicable Party
to comply with or satisfy in a timely manner any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party hereunder. The
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall not be deemed to
(A) modify the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder
of the Party delivering such notice, or any of the Disclosures Schedules, or
(B) cure or prevent any misrepresentation, inaccuracy, untruth or breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement or failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Article VII or
Article VIII, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure
to comply with this Section 6.13 prior to the Closing Date in and of itself
will not constitute the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.2 or
Section 8.2, as the case may be, to be satisfied unless (i) such failure
materially prejudices another Partys ability to exercise its rights or
remedies hereunder prior to the Closing or (ii) the underlying event would
independently result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.1
or Section 8.1, as the case may be, to be satisfied. 

  

 6.14 _Title Insurance and Surveys_. With respect to the Owned Real Property, Seller and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer (at Buyers sole cost and expense) in obtaining title insurance policies and surveys in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, including removing from title any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

 6.15 _FDA Matters_. 

  

 (a) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all activities reasonably necessary to (i) initiate and continue the remediation of all outstanding FDA observations and findings with respect to the Companys regulatory compliance, consistent with the Companys operating plan for fiscal year 2010 (based on the April 2010 version of such plan) as it relates to remediation actions, (ii) promptly address all new FDA observations or findings in the event of an FDA communication with, audit of or inspection of the Company, (iii) cooperate with the FDA in the event of any threatened enforcement Action against the Company and address promptly any matters identified by the FDA to cause such enforcement Action not to be initiated, (iv) if an FDA enforcement Action is initiated against the Company, take prompt action to remediate any new or outstanding FDA observations and findings and seek withdrawal or mitigation of any such Action, (v) provide prompt notice to Buyer as to any threatened or initiated enforcement Action against the Company, including information as to the scope and nature of such Action and any planned response, and (vi) reasonably consider any proposals made by Buyer in connection with any such matters. On a weekly basis, Seller shall provide updates to Buyer on the status of all such remediation efforts, including with respect to any meetings or other communications with the FDA. Any costs or 

   ##### 

  

    

expenses incurred by the Company in connection with complying with this
Section 6.15 shall be borne by Seller. 

  

       | (b)  |   | From and after the Closing until the date that is
three (3) years from the Closing Date, in connection with any Losses arising
out of or resulting from (directly or indirectly) the Known FDA Matters,
Seller shall be responsible for (and shall pay) eighty percent (80%) of all
such Losses and Buyer shall be responsible for (and shall pay) twenty percent
(20%) of all such Losses;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the foregoing
covenant (the " _FDA Cost-Sharing Covenant_ ") shall only apply once the
aggregate amount of Losses arising out of or resulting from (directly or
indirectly) the Known FDA Matters exceeds $2,000,000 (and Buyer shall be
solely responsible for such first $2,000,000), and (ii) the aggregate amount
required to be paid by Seller pursuant to the FDA Cost-Sharing Covenant shall
not exceed an amount equal to $25,000,000 (which, for purposes of calculating
this amount, (x) includes all amounts paid by Seller pursuant to
its indemnification obligations under Section 9.2(a)(i) hereof which are
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3(a)(ii), (y) excludes the
$2,000,000 threshold amount described in the foregoing clause (i), and (z)
excludes the twenty percent (20%) of the amount of Losses that are not
required to be paid by Seller pursuant to the FDA Cost-Sharing Covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any indemnified Party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except and only to the extent that the indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The Parties understand and agree that the failure of the indemnified Party to so notify the indemnifying Party prior to settling any such Third Party Claim (whether by paying the Third Party Claim or executing a binding settlement agreement with respect thereto) shall constitute actual and material prejudice to the indemnifying Partys ability to defend against such Third Party Claim; provided, that the indemnified Party is hereby 

   ##### 

  

    

authorized (but not obligated) prior to and during the Notice Period to file
any motion, answer or other pleading and to take any other action which the
indemnified Party shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect the
indemnified Partys interests. After receiving a Claim Notice, the
indemnifying Party shall be entitled, upon written notice to the indemnified
Party, at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take control of the defense
and investigation of such Action, (ii) to employ and engage attorneys of its
own choice (reasonably acceptable to the indemnified Party) to handle and
defend the same (unless the named Parties to such Action include both the
indemnifying Party and the indemnified Party and the indemnified Party has
been advised by counsel that (A) there may be one or more legal
defenses available to such indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying Party or (B) there
are issues that raise actual or likely conflicts of interest between the
indemnifying Party and the indemnified Party, in which event the indemnified
Party shall be entitled, at the indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense,
to separate counsel of its own choosing) and (iii) to compromise or settle
such Third Party Claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with
the written consent of the indemnified Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay
the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified Party if (1)
the indemnifying Party does not agree in writing to be fully responsible for
all Losses relating to such Third Party Claim; (2) the Third Party Claim
involves a Governmental Authority; (3) the Third Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal Action; or (4) the Third Party Claim
seeks equitable relief or any other non-monetary remedy against the
indemnified Party. In the event the indemnifying Party takes control of the
defense and investigation of such a Claim, the indemnified Party may, at its
own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of
such Action and any appeal arising therefrom (it being understood that the
indemnifying Party shall control such defense). If the indemnifying Party
fails to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15)
Business Days after receipt of the Claim Notice, the indemnified Party
against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted will (upon
delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying Party) have the right to
undertake, at the indemnifying Partys cost and expense, the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the
account and risk of the indemnifying Party. Any Third Party Claim the defense
of which is assumed by an indemnified Party shall not be compromised or
settled without the written consent of the indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event the indemnified
Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified Party will
keep the indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such
defense, compromise or settlement. The Parties shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects with each other in the investigation, trial and defense
of any Third Party Claim for Losses or Action and any appeal arising
therefrom. 

  

 (d) If an indemnified Party asserts a Claim which does not involve a Third Party Claim, the indemnified Party shall provide a Claim Notice to the indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the relevant survival period specified in Section 9.1. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days of its receipt of the Claim Notice that the indemnifying Party disputes such Claim, the amount of such Claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying Party hereunder. If the indemnifying Party makes an objection in writing (which such writing must include a reasonable description of the indemnifying Partys basis for such objection(s)), the indemnified 

   ##### 

  

    

Party shall have fifteen (15) Business Days to respond in a written statement
to the objection(s). If after such fifteen (15) Business Day period
there remains a dispute as to any such Claim, the Parties shall attempt in
good faith for twenty (20) Business Days to agree upon the rights of the
respective Parties with respect to such Claim. If the Parties should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both Parties. If such Parties shall not agree, an indemnified Party
shall be entitled to initiate an Action and seek remedies as may be permitted
under the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (e) In the event of payment in full by the indemnifying Party to the indemnified Party in connection with any Claim (an " _Indemnified Claim_ "), the indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of the indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which the indemnified Party may have any right or Claim relating to such Indemnified Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Indemnified Claim or against any other Person. The indemnified Party shall cooperate with the indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of the indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right or Claim. 

  

 (f) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any Claim or Liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify another Party hereunder, including, at the written request of, and at the sole cost and expense of, the indemnifying Party, using commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such Claim or Liability. 

  

 (g) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, or the amount of any Loss related to a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be considered without regard to any "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications contained therein. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation, inquiry or examination made for or on behalf of any Party, or the knowledge of any Party of a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the other Party. 

  

 9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 9.3(a), notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) no indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) hereof shall be made by Seller and no indemnification under Section 9.2(b)(i) hereof shall be made by Buyer, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any Liability, respectively, to the other therefor, unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses subject to indemnification pursuant thereto and due the Party being indemnified shall exceed $1,250,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), and once the Threshold Amount is exceeded the indemnifying Party shall indemnify the indemnified Party, and shall be liable, only for the amount of any such Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; (ii) the aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to its indemnification obligations under Section 9.2(a)(i) hereof or by Buyer pursuant to its indemnification obligations under Section 9.2(b)(i) hereof shall not exceed an amount equal to $25,000,000 ((A) which amount, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes the Threshold Amount and (B) in the case of Seller, for purposes of calculating such amount, 

   ##### 

  

    

includes any amounts paid by Seller pursuant to the FDA Cost-
Sharing Covenant), and neither Party shall have any Liability to any
indemnified Party for, and such indemnified Parties shall have no right to
recover from Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, any amount of Losses which
exceeds (and from and after the time such Losses exceed) such amount;
and (iii) no indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) hereof shall be made by
Seller and no indemnification under Section 9.2(b)(i) hereof shall be made by
Buyer, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any Liability, respectively,
to the other for any individual Claim or any Liability arising out of or
resulting from a single action, event, occurrence or a set of
circumstances, unless such individual Claim or such Liability arising out of
or resulting from a single action, event, occurrence or a set of
circumstances is greater than $37,500; _provided_ , that in the case
of clause (iii) above, any Claims or Liabilities resulting from similar facts
or circumstances shall be aggregated for the purposes of determining whether
such Claims or Liabilities are indemnifiable pursuant to such clause. The
applicable indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification without
regard to any of the provisions of this Section 9.3(a) with respect to
indemnification obligations for Losses relating to Fundamental
Representations and Warranties or Claims of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach of this Agreement (provided, however, that
the aggregate Liability of Seller or Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.3(a)
shall in no event exceed the Initial Cash Price, plus any Earnout Amounts
paid to Seller pursuant to Section 2.3). 

  

 (b) 

   

 (i) To the extent that any Losses or Claim therefor which is subject to indemnification hereunder are covered by insurance held by any indemnified Party (an " _Insured Loss_ "), such indemnified Party shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof with respect to the amount of Losses in excess of the net cash proceeds actually received by such indemnified Party pursuant to such insurance (after deducting the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such proceeds, excluding incremental insurance premium costs). With respect to any Insured Loss, the applicable indemnified Party shall first use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery from the provider of such insurance and then, to the extent that the net cash proceeds received by such indemnified Party (after deducting the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such proceeds, excluding incremental insurance premium costs) are less than the amount of the Losses indemnified hereunder, or if the indemnified Party is unable to promptly obtain full recovery from such provider, the indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof with respect to the amount of the Losses that exceed such recovery, if any; provided, however, that if, following the receipt of any indemnity payments pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof, the indemnified Party obtains any insurance recovery from a third party insurance provider, with respect to such Losses, then such indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the indemnifying Party (in proportion to their relative payments in respect of the underlying Loss) the amount of the net cash proceeds received by such indemnified Party pursuant to such insurance (after deducting the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such proceeds, excluding incremental insurance premium costs) up to, but not in excess of, the amount of the indemnity payments made by the indemnifying Party pursuant to such Losses. The Parties agree that (i) no insurance company shall have any right of subrogation under this Section 9.3(b), (ii) this Section 9.3(b) is not for the benefit 

   ##### 

  

    

of any third party insurance provider and (iii) this Section 9.3(b) shall
not require any indemnified Party to initiate, engage in or threaten
litigation with any of its insurance carriers. 

   

 (ii) No Party shall, after the Final Settlement Date, make any Claim for indemnification if and to the extent the Losses with respect to such Claim were fully accounted for in the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount or the Final Closing Indebtedness. 

  

 (c) Except for (i) equitable relief, including, without limitation, injunctive relief or specific performance, to which either Party hereto may be entitled pursuant to other Sections of this Agreement, (ii) any Claims pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.3 and (iii) Claims of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach of this Agreement, the indemnification provided in this Article IX and Section 10.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties for monetary damages for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing or in the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article XI, each Party shall have the right to bring an action to enforce, or recover Losses from, the other Party for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Losses indemnifiable under this Article IX hereof shall expressly exclude punitive damages, except for any such Losses arising out of Third Party Claims (which shall be indemnifiable by the indemnifying Party for all such damages). 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses incurred, suffered or sustained by any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with, arising out of or resulting from any breach of the representations or warranties made by Seller in Section 4.15 where the matter giving rise to such Losses is discovered as a result of any Buyer Indemnified Parties conducting sampling and analysis of soil or groundwater at any Company Real Property after the Closing Date, except to the extent such sampling is: (i) required by Environmental Laws, including a permit issued pursuant to Environmental Laws; (ii) required by a Governmental Order; (iii) reasonably necessary to investigate identified conditions that indicate an imminent or substantial endangerment to health or the environment; (iv) reasonable to defend against or otherwise respond to a Third Party Claim; (v) with respect to Leased Real Property, necessary to comply with the requirements of the lease agreement pertaining to such Leased Real Property; (vi) requested in writing by a lender or prospective purchaser in connection with a sale, lease, financing or mortgage involving any Company Real Property; or (vii) conducted in connection with proposed construction or expansion at any the Company Real Property, to the extent such sampling is consistent with industry practice, provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification of any Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be limited by any Buyer Indemnified Party conducting sampling or analysis of any drinking water or production water wells that may exist on the Closing Date at any Company Real Property, or of any wastewater discharges at any Company Real Property, or of any indoor or outdoor air at any Company Real Property.

A copy of each such Separate Company Return shall be delivered to Seller at least 15 days prior to the due date of such Separate Company Return for Sellers review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and all reasonable comments of Seller shall be reflected on such Separate Company Returns prior to filing.

To the extent such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Tax Authority, Seller agrees to repay the amount of such refund or credit, together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by the applicable Governmental Authority, to Buyer.

Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and take all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional forms, Tax Returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve the Section 338 Election in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1. 

  

 (b) Within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare a determination of the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price (" _ADSP_ ") (as defined in the applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338) and a proposed allocation of the ADSP among the assets of the Company (the " _Proposed Allocation_ ") and shall deliver the Proposed Allocation to Seller, together with a copy of any appraisals on which the Proposed Allocation is based. Buyer and Seller shall consult in good faith with regard to the determination of the ADSP and the Proposed Allocation and shall agree on a final allocation (as finally agreed, the " _Final Allocation_ "). As soon as practicable after determination of the Final Allocation, Buyer shall prepare consistently therewith Internal Revenue Service Form 8883 and any similar forms required by applicable state and local Tax Laws (collectively, the " _Section 338 Allocation Forms_"), and promptly deliver copies of the Section 338 Allocation Forms to Seller for Sellers review and approval. 

  

 (c) Buyer, the Company and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, the Section 338 Election Forms and the Section 338 Allocation Forms) consistent with the Final Allocation.

 10.5 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to Article 9 or Section 10.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

  

 10.6 _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall have sole control of the conduct and defense of any audits, disputes, proceedings and Claims involving a Governmental Authority with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes (a " _Tax Claim_ "), provided, however, that Seller shall (i) keep Buyer reasonably informed of material 

   ##### 

  

    

developments of the progress of such Tax Claim and (ii) shall not settle or
compromise such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer, not to
be unreasonably withheld, in each of (i) and (ii) to the extent such Tax
Claim relates to a Straddle Period or the resolution of such Tax Claim could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the liability of
Buyer or its Affiliates for Taxes (taking into account Sellers
indemnification obligations hereunder). In the event of any conflict between
this Article X and the provisions of Article IX, the provisions of this
Article X shall control. 

  

ARTICLE XI. 
  _MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 11.1 _Termination_.

 (i) By mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; 

   

 (ii) By Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before October 31, 2010; provided, however, that this provision shall not be available to either Party if such Partys action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred by such date; 

   

 (iii) By Buyer if there is a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in Article IV hereof or any covenant or agreement to be complied with or performed by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement where such breach results or would if uncured result, individually or in the aggregate together with all such other breaches by Seller, in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied; provided, however, that with respect to the applicable breach, Buyer may not terminate this Agreement prior to the Closing Date if Seller has fully cured such breach within 10 Business Days after the receipt of written notice from Buyer of such failure; 

   

 (iv) By Seller if there is a breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in Article V hereof or of any covenant or agreement to be complied with or performed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement where such breach results or would if uncured result, individually or in the aggregate together with all such other breaches by Buyer, in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied; provided, however, that with respect to the applicable breach, Seller may not terminate this Agreement prior to the Closing Date if Buyer has fully cured such breach within 10 Business Days after the receipt of written notice from Seller of such failure; or

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement, no Party hereto shall have any Liability under this Agreement to any other Party hereto (or any of its Affiliates, directors, trustees, executors, officers, employees, agents or representatives), except for fraud or any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement. Upon any such termination, subject to Section 6.5, each Party will redeliver or destroy (at such Partys option) all documents, work papers and other material of any other Party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the same, provided that each Party (i) may retain any such information contained in an archived computer system backup in accordance with such Partys security and/or disaster recovery procedures and (ii) may retains copies of any such information prepared for archival or record retention purposes, where in each case, such information will remain subject to the provisions of Section 6.5.

 11.2 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_. 

  

 (a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party (by Contract, operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, that Buyer may, without the prior written consent of Seller, assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder, and any Party may assign any or all of their respective rights or obligations to any third party who subsequently purchases all or substantially all of the equity or Assets of such Party, subject, in the case of Buyer, to its obligations pursuant to Section 2.3 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, it is expressly agreed that the express assumption by the receiving, acquiring, leasing, surviving or successor Person(s) (on a joint and several basis with the relevant Party hereto) of all of the obligations of any Party hereto shall be a condition precedent to the transfer, sale, lease, assignment or other disposition of all or a substantial portion of the business, operations or Assets (including on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) of such party, by way of asset sale, equity sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization, operation of Law or otherwise, and that further such assumption shall be deemed to occur automatically to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided in Article IX, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their successors and permitted assigns any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under, or by reason of, this Agreement. No third party is entitled to rely on any of the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement. Buyer and Seller assume no liability to any third party because of any reliance on the representations, warranties and agreements of Buyer or Seller contained in this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Buyer hereby accepts each indemnity under Section 9.2 in favor of each of the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, as agent and trustee of such indemnified party, and Buyer may enforce such indemnities on behalf of that indemnified party. Seller agrees that it 

   ##### 

  

    

accepts each indemnity under Section 9.2 in favor of each of the other Seller
Indemnified Parties, as agent and trustee of such indemnified party, and
Seller may enforce such indemnities on behalf of that indemnified party. 

  

 11.3 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, so that, in addition to any other remedy that a Party may have under law or equity, each Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof, including the Closing. Each of the Parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defense that a remedy at law would be adequate in any action for specific performance and (ii) any requirement under any applicable law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 

  

 11.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when received if personally delivered, (b) when transmitted if transmitted by telecopy, electronic mail or other digital transmission, (c) the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery to a domestic address by recognized overnight delivery service and (d) upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

 11.9 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to herein, shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by Law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or any other such instrument. 

  

 11.10 _Titles; Gender; Certain Interpretive Matters_. The titles, captions or headings of the Articles and Sections herein, and the use of a particular gender, are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect or restrict the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any of such terms, unless the context otherwise requires, may be used in the singular or plural, depending upon the reference. All references in this Agreement to Dollars or "$" shall mean U.S. Dollars. The term "this Agreement" means this Stock Purchase Agreement together with all annexes, Disclosure Schedules and exhibits hereto, as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The use in this Agreement of the term "including" means "including, without limitation." The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the annexes, Disclosure Schedules and exhibits hereto, and not to any particular section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement. Where specific language is used to clarify by example a general statement contained herein, such specific language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the general statement to which it relates. To the extent that this Agreement requires the Company to take or omit to take any action prior to Closing, such agreement and obligations includes the obligation of Seller to cause the Company to take or omit to take such actions. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 11.11 _Disclosure Schedules; Construction of Certain Provisions_. No exceptions to any representations or warranties disclosed in one particular section of the Disclosure Schedules shall constitute an exception to any other representations or warranties made in Article IV or Article V of this Agreement unless the exception is disclosed as provided herein on each such other applicable section of the Disclosure Schedules or cross-referenced in such other applicable section of the Disclosure Schedules or unless the applicability of such exception to another section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent on its face. It is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in a Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. No parol evidence of any nature shall be used in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

Each Party hereto further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such Claim. 

  

 (c) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE.

 11.13 _Independence of Agreements, Covenants, Representations and Warranties_. All agreements and covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a certain action or condition constitutes a default under a certain agreement or covenant, the fact that such action or condition is permitted by another agreement or covenant shall not affect the occurrence of such default. In addition, all representations and warranties hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular representation or warranty proves to be incorrect or is breached, the fact that another representation or warranty concerning the same or similar subject matter is correct or is not breached will not affect the incorrectness of or a breach of a representation and warranty hereunder.

 11.14 _DHR Guaranty_. 

   

 (a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Danaher Corporation (" _DHR_ ") hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the punctual and full payment in cash, when due from Buyer, of all amounts due to Seller under this Agreement and the performance of all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement. DHR shall make any payments required of it hereunder specifically in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, as if such payments were being made by Buyer to Seller. The guaranty described in this Section 11.14(a) (i) shall terminate at the Closing and (ii) is a primary guaranty of performance and not just of collection. 

  

 (b) If the Closing occurs, from and after the Closing, DHR hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the punctual and full payment in cash, when due from Buyer, of all Earnout Amounts (if any) due to Seller under Section 2.3. To the extent payment is not made by Buyer, DHR shall make any payments required of it under Section 2.3 specifically in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.3, as if such payments were being made by Buyer to Seller. The guaranty described in this Section 11.14(b) shall terminate when all Earnout Amounts (if any) have been fully paid. The guaranty described in this Section 11.14(b), together with the guaranty described in Section 11.14(a), shall be herein referred to as the " _Guaranty_." 

  

 (c) DHR represents that, directly or through one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries, it owns 100% of the outstanding Equity Interests of Buyer. 

  

 (d) DHR hereby waives (i) notice of acceptance of the Guaranty; (ii) presentment and demand concerning the Liabilities of DHR; and (iii) any right to require that any Action be brought against Buyer or any other Person, or to require that Seller seek enforcement of any performance against Buyer or any other Person prior to any Action against DHR under the terms hereof. 

  

 (e) Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Seller in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights under the Guaranty shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights, or a release of DHR from any obligations hereunder. 

  

 (f) DHR consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or other changes in the time of payment of, or other changes in the terms of the obligations subject to, the Guaranty or any part thereof or any changes or modifications to the terms of the Guaranty, in each case, to the extent agreed in writing by Buyer, in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 (g) DHR agrees that the Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if all or any part of any payment made thereunder is at any time avoided or rescinded or must otherwise be restored or repaid as a result of the bankruptcy of Buyer or DHR, or otherwise avoided or recovered directly or indirectly from Seller as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, irrespective of any notice of revocation given by Buyer or DHR prior to such avoidance or recovery.
