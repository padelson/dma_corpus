<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.14 <U>DHR Guaranty</U>.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;From the date hereof until the Closing, Danaher Corporation (&#147;<U>DHR</U>&#148;) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the punctual and full payment in cash, when
due from Buyer, of all amounts due to Seller under this Agreement and the performance of all
obligations of Buyer under this Agreement. DHR shall make any payments required of it hereunder
specifically in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, as if such payments
were being made by Buyer to Seller. The guaranty described in this Section&nbsp;11.14(a) (i)&nbsp;shall
terminate at the Closing and (ii)&nbsp;is a primary guaranty of performance and not just of collection.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;If the Closing occurs, from and after the Closing, DHR hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to Seller the punctual and full payment in cash, when due from Buyer, of
all Earnout Amounts (if any) due to Seller under Section&nbsp;2.3. To the extent payment is not made by
Buyer, DHR shall make any payments required of it under Section&nbsp;2.3 specifically in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Section&nbsp;2.3, as if such payments were being made by Buyer to Seller.
The guaranty described in this Section&nbsp;11.14(b) shall terminate when all Earnout Amounts (if any)
have been fully paid. The guaranty described in this Section&nbsp;11.14(b), together with the guaranty
described in Section&nbsp;11.14(a), shall be herein referred to as the &#147;<U>Guaranty</U>.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;DHR represents that, directly or through one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries, it owns
100% of the outstanding Equity Interests of Buyer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;DHR hereby waives (i)&nbsp;notice of acceptance of the Guaranty; (ii)&nbsp;presentment and demand
concerning the Liabilities of DHR; and (iii)&nbsp;any right to require that any Action be brought
against Buyer or any other Person, or to require that Seller seek
enforcement of any performance against Buyer or any other Person prior to any Action against
DHR under the terms hereof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Seller in the exercise of, or
failure to exercise, any rights under the Guaranty shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a
waiver of any other rights, or a release of DHR from any obligations hereunder.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;DHR consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or other changes in the
time of payment of, or other changes in the terms of the obligations subject to, the Guaranty or
any part thereof or any changes or modifications to the terms of the Guaranty, in each case, to the
extent agreed in writing by Buyer, in accordance with this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;DHR agrees that the Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the
case may be, if all or any part of any payment made thereunder is at any time avoided or rescinded
or must otherwise be restored or repaid as a result of the bankruptcy of Buyer or DHR, or otherwise
avoided or recovered directly or indirectly from Seller as a preference, fraudulent transfer or
otherwise, irrespective of any notice of revocation given by Buyer or DHR prior to such avoidance
or recovery.
