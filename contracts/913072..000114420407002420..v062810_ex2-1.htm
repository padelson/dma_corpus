**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER** ,  dated  as of January 18, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "),  by  and between Chittenden Corporation, a Vermont
corporation (" _Buyer_ "),  and  Merrill Merchants Bancshares, Inc., a Maine
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

 

**RECITALS**

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company
have determined that  it  is in the best interests of their respective
corporations and shareholders  to  enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the strategic business combination  provided for herein, pursuant
to which, subject to the terms and conditions  set  forth herein, the
Company will merge with and into Buyer, with Buyer being  the  surviving
corporation and continuing its corporate existence under the laws  of  the
State of Vermont (the " _Merger_ ");

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  as a  condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into
this Agreement, each of  the  directors and executive officers of the
Company (the " _Voting  Agreement Shareholders_ ")  has  entered into a
Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Buyer (each  a "
_Voting  Agreement_ "),  pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Shareholder
has agreed, among other  things, to vote such Voting Agreement Shareholder's
shares of common stock, par  value $1.00 per share, of the Company ("
_Company  Common Stock_ ")  in  favor of the approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated  hereby, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Voting  Agreement;

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  parties intend the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of  Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),  and  that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of 
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in  connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe certain conditions to the  Merger.

 

 

**NOW,  THEREFORE** ,  in  consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and  agreements contained herein, and intending
to be legally bound hereby, the  parties agree as follows:

 

 

**ARTICLE  I -** **THE  MERGER**

 

 

1.1 _The  Merger_.  Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the Vermont  Business Corporation Act (" _VBCA_ ")  and 
the Maine Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "),  and  in reliance upon
the representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein,  at the
Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into Buyer, the separate 
corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Buyer shall survive and 
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Vermont
(Buyer,  as the surviving corporation in the Merger, being sometimes referred
to herein  as the " _Surviving  Corporation_ "). 

 

 

1.2 _Effective  Time_.  On the  Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
after all of the conditions set forth  in Article VII shall have been
satisfied or, if permissible, waived by the  party  entitled to the benefit
of the same, Buyer and the Company shall (a) execute  and  file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Vermont, articles of merger  in  a form
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Company, in accordance with  the 
VBCA and (b) execute and file with the Secretary of State of the State of
Maine,  articles of merger in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the
Company,  in accordance with the MBCA. The Merger shall become effective at
the time  and  on the date of such filings or at the time and on the date
specified therein  (the " _Effective  Time_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.3 _Effects  of the Merger_.  At the  Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided herein and as  provided in the applicable
provisions of the VBCA and the MBCA.

 

 

1.4 _Closing_.  The  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
consummated at a closing  (the " _Closing_ ")  that  will take place at the
offices of Goodwin Procter LLP,  Exchange Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02109
on a date to be specified by the  parties, which shall be no later than five
(5) Business Days (as defined in  Section 9.2(a)) after all of the conditions
to the Closing set forth in Article  VII (other than conditions to be
satisfied at the Closing, which shall be  satisfied or waived at the Closing)
have been satisfied or waived in accordance  with the terms hereof, such day
being referred to herein as the " _Closing  Date_."  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Closing may take place at such other place,  time or date as
may be mutually agreed upon in writing by Buyer and the  Company.

 

 

1.5 _Articles  of Incorporation and Bylaws_.  The  Articles of
Incorporation of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to the  Effective
Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving  Corporation,
until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance  with 
applicable law. The Bylaws of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to the 
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until 
thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable 
law.

 

 

1.6 _Directors  of the Surviving Corporation_.  The  directors of Buyer
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the  directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each of whom shall serve in accordance  with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

1.7 _Officers  of the Surviving Corporation_.  The  officers of Buyer

together with one additional director designated by Buyer and  reasonably
acceptable to the Company, each of whom shall serve in accordance  with the
organizational documents of the Company Bank.

 

 

1.9 _Tax  Consequences_.  It is  intended that the Merger shall qualify as
a "reorganization" under Section  368(a) of the Code, and that the Agreement
shall constitute a "plan of  reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and

**ARTICLE  II -** **MERGER  CONSIDERATION;**

 

**ELECTION  AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 

 

2.1 _Merger  Consideration_.  Subject  to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, automatically by  virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Buyer, the Company  or  any shareholder of the
Company:

 

 

(a) Each  share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Buyer ("
_Buyer  Common Stock_ ")  that  is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain  outstanding following the Effective Time
and shall be unchanged by the  Merger.

 

 

(b) Each  share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Stock (as defined in
Section  9.2(a)) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and retired  at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no
payment shall  be  made with respect thereto.

 

 

(c) Each  share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the  Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock) shall become and be
converted into,  as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement,  the  right to receive at the election of the holder thereof
as provided in Section  2.4 either: (i) $31.00 in cash (the " _Cash 
Consideration_ ");  or  (ii) 1.02 shares (the " _Exchange  Ratio_ ")  of 
Buyer Common Stock (the " _Stock  Consideration_ ").  The  Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein 
collectively as the " _Merger  Consideration_."

 

 

2.2 _Rights  as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_.  All  shares of Company
Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.1(c),  shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired  and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")  previously
evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right  to 
receive for each such share of Company Common Stock, the Merger
Consideration  and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common
Stock in accordance  with Sections 2.1(c) and 2.3. At the Effective Time,
holders of Company Common  Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, shareholders of the  Company, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and cash  in  lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
as provided under this Article  II and the right to receive any unpaid
dividend with respect to the Company  Common Stock with a record date
occurring prior to the Effective Time. After  the  Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of  the  Company of shares
of Company Common Stock, other than transfers of Company  Common Stock that
have occurred prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

2.3 _Fractional  Shares_.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Buyer Common  Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership  thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay to  each  holder of a fractional
share of Buyer Common Stock an amount of cash (without  interest) determined
by multiplying the fractional share interest to which  such  holder would
otherwise be entitled by the average of the last sale prices of  Buyer Common
Stock, as reported on The New York Stock Exchange, Inc.  (" _NYSE_ ")  (as 
reported in _The  Wall Street Journal_   or, if  not reported therein, in
another authoritative source), for the five (5) NYSE  trading days
immediately preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest  whole cent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.4 _Election  Procedures_.

 

 

(a) An  election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to  Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to  a  bank or trust company designated by Buyer and reasonably
satisfactory to the  Company (the " _Exchange  Agent_ "))  in  such form
as the Company and Buyer shall mutually agree (the " _Election  Form_ "), 
shall  be mailed no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
anticipated  Election Deadline (the " _Mailing  Date_ ")  to  each holder
of record of Company Common Stock. Each Election Form shall permit  the
holder of record of Company Common Stock (or in the case of nominee record 
holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) 
to  (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all or a portion of
such  holder's shares (a " _Cash  Election_ "),  (ii)  elect to receive
the Stock Consideration for all or a portion of such holder's  shares (a "
_Stock  Election_ "),  or (iii)  make no election with respect to the
receipt of the Cash Consideration or the  Stock Consideration (a " _Non-
Election_ ");  _provided_   that,  notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, sixty percent (60%)  of  the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time, excluding any Treasury Stock (the  " _Stock  Conversion
Number_ "),  shall  be converted into the Stock Consideration and forty
percent (40%) of such shares  of Company Common Stock shall be converted into
the Cash Consideration. A record  holder acting in different capacities or
acting on behalf of other Persons  (as  defined in Section 9.2(a)) in any
way will be entitled to submit an Election  Form for each capacity in which
such record holder so acts with respect to  each  Person for which it so
acts. Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Cash  Election has been
made are referred to herein as " _Cash  Election Shares_." Shares  of
Company Common Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made are referred 
to herein as " _Stock  Election Shares_." Shares  of Company Common Stock
as to which no election has been made (or as to which  an  Election Form is
not properly completed and returned in a timely fashion) are  referred to
herein as " _Non-Election  Shares_." The  aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to which a  Stock  Election has been made
is referred to herein as the " _Stock  Election Number_." 

 

 

(b) To  be  effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted
to the Exchange  Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a date
no later than the  5th Business Day prior to the Closing Date to be mutually
agreed upon by the  parties (which date shall be publicly announced by Buyer
as soon as practicable  prior to such date) (the " _Election  Deadline_
"),  accompanied by the Certificates as to which such Election Form is being
made  or  by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as
set forth  in  the Election Form, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange  or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States ( _provided_   that  such Certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time  required in such guarantee of delivery; failure
to deliver shares of Company  Common Stock covered by such guarantee of
delivery within the time set forth  on  such guarantee shall be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made  election, unless otherwise determined
by Buyer, in its sole discretion). For  shares of Company Common Stock held
in book entry form, Buyer shall establish  procedures for delivery of such
shares, which procedures shall be reasonably  acceptable to the Company. If a
holder of Company Common Stock either (i) does  not submit a properly
completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii)  revokes the holder's
Election Form prior to the Election Deadline (without later  submitting a
properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline),  the shares
of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be designated  Non-Election
Shares. In addition, all Election Forms shall automatically be  revoked, and
all Certificates returned, if the Exchange Agent is notified in  writing by
Buyer and the Company that this Agreement has been terminated.  Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange  Agent
shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, 
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard 
immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the 
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive.
Neither  Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify
any Person  of any defect in an Election Form.

(c) The  allocation among the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of
rights to  receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration will be
made as  follows:

 

 

(i) If  the  Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then
all Cash  Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right  to  receive the Cash Consideration, and, subject to Section 2.3
hereof, each holder  of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the
Stock Consideration  in  respect of that number of Stock Election Shares
held by such holder equal to  the  product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of Stock Election Shares held  by  such holder by (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Stock Conversion  Number and the denominator of
which is the Stock Election Number, with the  remaining number of such
holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the  right to receive the
Cash Consideration;

 

 

(ii) If  the  Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount  by  which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
Election Number being  referred to herein as the " _Shortfall  Number_ "), 
then  all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the  Stock  Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and the Cash Election
Shares shall  be  treated in the following manner:

 

 

(A)if  the  Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares,  then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive  the  Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 2.3
hereof, each holder of  Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that  number of Non-Election Shares held by such
holder equal to the product obtained  by multiplying (x) the number of Non-
Election Shares held by such holder by  (y)  a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator  of which is the total
number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number  of such holder's
Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive  the Cash
Consideration; or

 

 

(B)if  the  Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all  Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock  Consideration, and, subject to Section 2.3 hereof, each holder of Cash
Election  Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash  Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number  of  Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of  which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall
Number exceeds (2) the total  number of Non-Election Shares and the
denominator of which is the total number  of Cash Election Shares, with the
remaining number of such holder's Cash  Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash  Consideration.

2.5 _Exchange  Procedures_. 

 

 

(a) On  or  before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, (i)  Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in  accordance with this Article II, certificates representing
the shares of Buyer  Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article II ("
_New  Certificates_ ")  and  (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be
delivered, to the Exchange Agent  an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate amount of cash  payable pursuant to this Article II
(including the estimated amount of cash  to  be paid in lieu of fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock) (such cash and  New  Certificates, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange  Fund_ ").

 

 

(b) No  later  than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent  shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates who has  not  previously surrendered such Certificate or
Certificates with an Election Form,  a  form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon  delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use  in  effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger  Consideration into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by  such  Certificate or Certificates
shall have been converted pursuant to Sections  2.1,  2.3 and 2.4 of this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for  exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly  completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate  shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New 
Certificate representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (if
any)  to  which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become
entitled  pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a check representing that amount
of cash (if  any) to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall
have become  entitled pursuant to this Agreement and/or (iii) a check
representing the amount  of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Buyer Common Stock  which such former holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Certificate  surrendered pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered  shall  forthwith be
cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section  2.5(b), each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Treasury Stock)  shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the  right  to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in Sections 
2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as
provided  in paragraph (c) of this Section 2.5. No interest shall be paid or
accrued  on  any cash constituting Merger Consideration (including any cash
in lieu of  fractional shares) and any unpaid dividends and distributions
payable to holders  of Certificates.

 

 

(c) No  dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time  with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any  unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such  Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.5. After the
surrender of a  Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.5, the record
holder thereof  shall  be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any  interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares  of  Buyer Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) The  Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated
to deliver  cash and/or a New Certificate or New Certificates representing
shares of Buyer  Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be  entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders
the Certificate  or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common
Stock for exchange  as  provided in this Section 2.5, or, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity  agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may
be required in each case by Buyer.  If any New Certificates evidencing shares
of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued  in a name other than that in which
the Certificate evidencing Company Common  Stock surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition  of  the issuance thereof
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly  endorsed or
accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the  Certificate
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person  requesting
such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax  required
by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate for shares of Buyer  Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the 
Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the 
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(e) Any  portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of  the  Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time
(as well as any interest  or  proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be
delivered by the Exchange Agent  to Buyer. Any shareholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied  with  Section 2.5(b) shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for  the  Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common  Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each  case
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of 
Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not
claimed  prior to the date on which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash
would  otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit
or agency,  the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and  any  other applicable law, become the property of Buyer (and
to the extent not in  its  possession shall be delivered to it), free and
clear of all claims or interest  of any Person previously entitled to such
property. Neither the Exchange Agent  nor any party to this Agreement shall
be liable to any holder of shares of  Company Common Stock represented by any
Certificate for any consideration paid  to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or  similar laws. Buyer and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the  stock transfer books of
the Company to establish the identity of those Persons  entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which  books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with  respect to
ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any 
Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any 
Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third 
party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims  thereto.

 

 

(f) Buyer  (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and  withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any  holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Buyer is required  to  deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts
so deducted and withheld  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to  the  holder of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and  withholding was made by Buyer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.6 _Anti-Dilution  Provisions_.  In the  event Buyer or the Company
changes (or establishes a record date for changing)  the number of, or
provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock  or  Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as  a 
result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, 
or  similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock
or  Company Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the 
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Consideration shall be 
proportionately and appropriately adjusted; _provided_   that,  for the
avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to  the 
Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common
Stock  and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide third
party  transaction or (ii) Buyer issues employee or director stock grants or
similar  equity awards.

 

 

2.7 _Options_.  Each  option to purchase Company Common Stock (collectively,
the " _Options_ ")  granted under the Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan (the "
_Company  Option Plan_ "),  whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time and which has not been exercised or
canceled prior thereto shall,  at the Effective Time, be canceled and, on the
Closing Date, the Company or  the  Company Bank shall pay to the holder
thereof cash in an amount equal to the  product of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock provided for in  such  Option and (ii) the excess,
if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise  price per share of
Company Common Stock provided for in such Option, which  cash  payment shall
be made without interest and shall be net of all applicable  withholding
taxes. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its  reasonable best
efforts to obtain the written acknowledgment of each holder  of a  then-
outstanding Option with respect to the termination of the Option and the 
payment for such Option in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.7. At 
the  Effective Time, the Company Option Plan shall terminate and the
provisions  in  any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant  of  any other interest in respect of the capital stock of
the Company shall be  of no  further force and effect and shall be deemed to
be deleted.

3.13 _Taxes  and Tax Returns_.  Except  as set forth on _Schedule  3.13_
  of the  Company Disclosure Schedule:

 

 

(a) The  Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed in correct
form all  Tax  Returns (as defined in Section 9.2(a)) that were required to
be filed by any  of  them, and have paid all Taxes (as defined in Section
9.2(a)) owed by them  (whether or not shown as due on any Tax Returns).

 

 

(b) No  assessment that has not been settled or otherwise resolved has been
made with  respect to Taxes, other than such additional Taxes as are being
contested in  good faith and which are described on _Schedule  3.13_   of
the  Company Disclosure Schedule. The Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_
")  or  other taxing authority, as applicable, for all years through
December 31, 2002  (or the statute of limitations has closed without
examination) and any liability  with respect thereto has been satisfied.
There are no disputes pending or  written claims asserted for Taxes or
assessments upon either the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries, nor has
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been  requested to give, or has given,
any currently effective waivers extending  the  statutory period of
limitation applicable to any Tax assessment or deficiency.  Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary  of  any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No deficiency in 
Taxes or other proposed adjustment that has not been settled or otherwise 
resolved has been asserted in writing by any taxing authority against the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no Tax 
Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is now under examination by 
any  applicable taxing authority. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than
current  Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of the Company
or any of  its  Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Adequate  provision has been made on the Company Balance Sheet for all
Taxes of the  Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of all periods through
the date hereof.  In addition, (A) proper and accurate amounts have been
withheld by each of  the  Company and its Subsidiaries from its respective
employees for all prior periods  in compliance in all respects with the tax
withholding provisions of applicable  federal, state, county and local laws;
(B) federal, state, county and local  returns which are complete and accurate
in all respects have been filed by  the  Company and its Subsidiaries for
all periods for which returns were due with  respect to income tax
withholding, Social Security and unemployment taxes;  and  (C) the amounts
shown on such returns to be due and payable have been paid  in  full or
adequate provision therefor has been included by the Company in its 
consolidated financial statements included in the Company 2005 Form 10-K,
or,  with respect to returns filed after the date hereof, will be so paid or
provided  for in the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the
period  covered by such returns. Since the date of the Company Balance Sheet,
neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability
for Taxes  arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used
in GAAP,  outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. The  Company has made available to Buyer correct and complete
copies of all federal  income Tax Returns, examination reports, and
statements of deficiencies assessed  against or agreed to by the Company, or
any of its Subsidiaries filed or  received since December 31, 2002.

 

 

(d) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any Tax  indemnification, Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement with any
Person or  has  any current or potential contractual obligation to indemnify
any other Person  with respect to Taxes.

 

 

(e) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed or been
included in a  combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return (including
any consolidated  federal income Tax Return) other than one of which the
Company was the  parent.

 

 

(f) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any payment, is
obligated  to  make any payment, or is a party to any agreement that could
obligate it to  make  any payment that will not be deductible under Code
Section 162(m) or Code  Section 280G.

 

 

(g) No  property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is property that
is or will  be required to be treated as being owned by another Person
pursuant to the  provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the Code (as in effect
prior to its amendment  by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) or is "tax exempt use
property" within the  meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has been required to include in income
any adjustment pursuant  to  Section 481 of the Code by reason of a
voluntary change in accounting method  initiated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and the IRS has not  initiated or proposed any such adjustment
or change in accounting  method.

 

 

(h) None  of  the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required to include
any item of income  in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any taxable period  (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as
a result of any: (A)  closing agreement as described in Code Section 7121 (or
any corresponding or  similar provision of state, local, or foreign income
Tax law) executed on or  prior to the Closing Date; (B) intercompany
transactions or any excess loss  account described in Treasury Regulations
under Code Section 1502 (or any  corresponding or similar provision of state,
local, or foreign income Tax law);  (C) installment sale or open transaction
disposition made on or prior to the  Closing Date; or (D) prepaid amount
received on or prior to the Closing  Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock of
another Person,  or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a
transaction that was  purported or intended to be governed in whole or in
part by Code Section 355  or  Section 361.

 

 

(j) As  of the  date hereof, the Company is aware of no reason why the
Merger will fail to  qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

 

3.14 _Employee  Benefit Plans_. 

 

 

(a) _Schedule  3.14(a)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of every Employee Program (as  defined below) that has been maintained
by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate  (as  defined below) at any time during
the six-year period ending on the Closing  Date.

 

 

(b) Each  Employee Program which has ever been maintained by the Company or
an ERISA  Affiliate and which has been intended to qualify under Section
401(a) or  501(c)(9) of the Code has received a favorable determination or
approval letter  from the IRS regarding its qualification under such section
and has, in fact,  been qualified under the applicable section of the Code
from the effective  date  of such Employee Program through and including the
Closing Date (or, if earlier,  the date that all of such Employee Program's
assets were distributed). No event  or omission has occurred which would
cause any Employee Program to lose its  qualification or otherwise fail to
satisfy the relevant requirements to provide  tax-favored benefits under the
applicable Code Section (including, without  limitation, Code Sections 105,
125, 401(a) and 501(c)(9)). Each asset held  under  any such Employee
Program may be liquidated or terminated without the imposition  of any
redemption fee, surrender charge or comparable liability. No partial 
termination (within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) has
occurred  with respect to any Employee Program.

 

 

(c) Neither  the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate knows, nor should any of
them reasonably  know, of any failure of any party to comply with any laws
applicable with  respect to the Employee Programs that have ever been
maintained by the Company  or any ERISA Affiliate. With respect to any
Employee Program ever maintained  by  the Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
there has been no (i) "prohibited  transaction," as defined in Section 406 of
the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
"),  or  Code Section 4975, (ii) failure to comply with any provision of
ERISA, other  applicable law, or any agreement, or (iii) non-deductible
contribution, which,  in the case of any of (i), (ii), or (iii), could
subject the Company or any  ERISA Affiliate to liability either directly or
indirectly (including, without  limitation, through any obligation of
indemnification or contribution) for  any  damages, penalties, or Taxes, or
any other loss or expense. No litigation or  governmental administrative
proceeding (or investigation) or other proceeding  (other than those relating
to routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to  the  Company's knowledge,
threatened with respect to any such Employee Program. All  payments and/or
contributions required to have been made (under the provisions  of any
agreements or other governing documents or applicable law) with respect  to
all Employee Programs ever maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, 
for all periods prior to the Closing Date, either have been made or have
been  properly accrued.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Neither  the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained any
Employee Program  which has been subject to Title IV of ERISA or Code Section
412 or ERISA Section  302, including, but not limited to, any Multiemployer
Plan (as defined below).  Except as described in _Schedule  3.14(d)_   of
the  Company Disclosure Schedule, no Employee Program maintained by the
Company  or  any ERISA Affiliate and subject to Title IV of ERISA (other
than a  Multiemployer Plan) has any "unfunded benefit liabilities" within the
meaning of  ERISA Section 4001(a)(18), as of the Closing Date. Except as
described in  _Schedule  3.14(d)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has  ever maintained a
Multiemployer Plan. Except as described in _Schedule  3.14(d)_   of the 
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Employee Programs ever maintained 
by  the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has ever provided health care or any
other  non-pension benefits to any employees after their employment is
terminated  (other than as required by part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of 
ERISA) or has ever promised to provide such post-termination  benefits.

 

 

(e) With  respect to each Employee Program maintained by the Company within
the six (6)  years preceding the Closing Date, complete and correct copies of
the following  documents (if applicable to such Employee Program) have
previously been made  available to Buyer: (i) all documents embodying or
governing such Employee  Program, and any funding medium for the Employee
Program (including, without  limitation, trust agreements) as they may have
been amended to the date hereof;  (ii) the most recent IRS determination or
approval letter with respect to such  Employee Program under Code Section
401(a) or 501(c)(9), and any applications  for determination or approval
subsequently filed with the IRS; (iii) the six  (6)  most recently filed IRS
Forms 5500, with all applicable schedules and  accountants' opinions attached
thereto; (iv) the six (6) most recent actuarial  valuation reports completed
with respect to such Employee Program; (v) the  summary plan description for
such Employee Program (or other descriptions of  such Employee Program
provided to employees) and all modifications thereto;  (vi)  any insurance
policy (including any fiduciary liability insurance policy or  fidelity bond)
related to such Employee Program; (vii) any registration  statement or other
filing made pursuant to any federal or state securities  law;  and (viii)
all correspondence to and from any state or federal agency within  the  last
six (6) years with respect to such Employee Program.

 

 

(f) Except  as  described in _Schedule  3.14(f)_   of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, each Employee Program required to be listed on 
_Schedule  3.14(a)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule may be amended,
terminated, or otherwise modified  by  the Company to the greatest extent
permitted by applicable law, including the  elimination of any and all future
benefit accruals under any Employee Program  and no employee communications
or provision of any Employee Program document  has  failed to effectively
reserve the right of the Company or the ERISA Affiliate  to  so amend,
terminate or otherwise modify such Employee Program. Except as  described in
_Schedule  3.14(f)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
execution and delivery of this  Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will  (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) result in, cause the  accelerated vesting, funding or
delivery of, or increase the amount or value  of,  any payment or benefit to
any current or former employee, officer or director  of  the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Each  Employee Program ever maintained by the Company (including each
non-qualified  deferred compensation arrangement) has been maintained in
compliance with all  applicable requirements of federal and state securities
laws including (without  limitation, if applicable) the requirements that the
offering of interests  in  such Employee Program be registered under the
Securities Act and/or state "blue  sky" laws.

 

 

(h) Each  Employee Program ever maintained by the Company or an ERISA
Affiliate has  complied with the applicable notification and other applicable
requirements  of  the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the
Newborns' and Mothers' Health  Protection Act of 1996, the Mental Health
Parity Act of 1996, and the Women's  Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998.

 

 

(i) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  3.14(i)_   of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Employee Program is a nonqualified deferred 
compensation plan, as such term is defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the 
Code  and the guidance thereunder (a " _409A  Plan_ ").  Each  409A Plan
has been operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code since  January
1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section  409A
of the Code, the proposed regulations issued thereunder and IRS Notices 
2005-1 and 2006-79. Each 409A Plan complies in all respects, in both form
and  operation, with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
guidance  thereunder. No payment to be made under any 409A Plan is, or to the
knowledge  of  the Company will be, subject to the penalties of Section
409A(a)(1) of the  Code.  No Options provide for a deferral of compensation
subject to Section 409A of  the  Code and all Options were granted with an
exercise price equal to at least  100%  of the fair market value of the
underlying Company Common Stock on the date  the  Option was granted based
upon a reasonable valuation method.

 

 

(j) For  purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

(i) " _Employee  Program_ " means  (A) all employee benefit plans within
the meaning of ERISA Section 3(3),  including, but not limited to, multiple
employer welfare arrangements (within  the meaning of ERISA Section 3(40)),
plans to which more than one unaffiliated  employer contributes and employee
benefit plans (such as foreign or excess  benefit plans) which are not
subject to ERISA; (B) all stock option plans,  stock  purchase plans, bonus
or incentive award plans, severance pay policies or  agreements, deferred
compensation agreements, supplemental income arrangements,  vacation plans,
and all other employee benefit plans, agreements, and  arrangements
(including any informal arrangements) not described in (A) above,  including,
without limitation, any arrangement intended to comply with Code  Section
120, 125, 127, 129 or 137; and (C) all plans or arrangements providing 
compensation to employee and non-employee directors, including, without 
limitation, any employment agreements, severance agreements, change in
control  agreements or similar agreements. In the case of an Employee Program
funded  through a trust described in Code Section 401(a) or an organization
described  in  Code Section 501(c)(9), or any other funding vehicle, each
reference to such  Employee Program shall include a reference to such trust,
organization or other  vehicle.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) An  entity " _maintains_ " an  Employee Program if such entity
sponsors, contributes to, or provides benefits  under or through such
Employee Program, or has any obligation (by agreement  or  under applicable
law) to contribute to or provide benefits under or through  such  Employee
Program, or if such Employee Program provides benefits to or otherwise 
covers employees of such entity (or their spouses, dependents, or 
beneficiaries).

 

 

(iii) An  entity  is an " _ERISA  Affiliate_ " of  the  Company if it
would have ever been considered a single employer with the Company  under
ERISA Section 4001(b) or part of the same "controlled group" as the  Company
for purposes of ERISA Section 302(d)(8)(C).

 

 

(iv) " _Multiemployer  Plan_ " means  an employee pension or welfare
benefit plan to which more than one unaffiliated  employer contributes and
which is maintained pursuant to one or more collective  bargaining
agreements.

 

 

3.15 _Labor  Matters_.  The  Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with all federal, state and  local  laws respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of  employment, and wages and
hours, and other than normal accruals of wages during  regular payroll
cycles, there are no arrearages in the payment of wages. Neither  the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by any  collective
bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding  with a
labor union or labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that the Company or any 
of  its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice (within the
meaning  of  the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel the
Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization
as to wages and conditions  of employment. No work stoppage involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  is pending, or to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened. Neither the Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries is
involved in, or, to the knowledge of the Company,  threatened with or
affected by, any dispute, arbitration, lawsuit or  administrative proceeding
relating to labor or employment matters that would  reasonably be expected to
interfere in any respect with the respective business  activities represented
by any labor union, and to the knowledge of the Company,  no labor union is
attempting to organize employees of the Company or any of  its 
Subsidiaries.

 

 

3.16 _Insurance_.  The  Company and each of its Subsidiaries is insured, and
during each of the past  three (3) calendar years has been insured, for
reasonable amounts with  financially sound and reputable insurance companies
against such risks as  companies engaged in a similar business would, in
accordance with good business  practice customarily be insured, and has
maintained all insurance required  by  applicable laws and regulations.
_Schedule  3.16_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule lists all insurance
policies maintained by the  Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof. All of the policies  and bonds maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries are in full  force  and effect and all claims thereunder
have been filed in a due and timely manner  and, to the knowledge of the

Company Bank's Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act data for the year ended December

(b) Buyer  and  each of its Subsidiaries, officers and directors are in
compliance with, and  have complied, with (1) the applicable provisions of
Sarbanes-Oxley and the  related rules and regulations promulgated under such
act and the Exchange Act  and (2) the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations  of  the NYSE. Buyer (i) has established
and maintained disclosure controls and  procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are  defined in paragraphs (3) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the  Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) has  disclosed based on its most
recent evaluations, to its outside auditors and  the  audit committee of the
Buyer Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material  weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting (as defined

4.12 _Absence  of Certain Changes or Events_.  Except  as disclosed in the
Buyer SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, or  as  otherwise
expressly permitted or expressly contemplated by this Agreement,  since 
December 31, 2005, there has been no change or development in the business, 
operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), results 
of  operations, cash flows or properties of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
which  has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the  aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and to the knowledge of
Buyer,  no  fact or condition exists which is reasonably likely to cause a
Buyer Material  Adverse Effect in the future.

 

 

4.13 _Tax  Treatment_.  As of  the date hereof, Buyer is aware of no reason
why the Merger will fail to qualify  as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a) of the Code.

 

 

4.14 _Employee  Benefit Plans_. Schedule 4.14 of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a  list of every Employee Program currently maintained by
Buyer or an ERISA  Affiliate. Each such Employee Program has been
administered in accordance with  the terms thereof and applicable law. Such
Employee Programs which are "employee  benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA are in compliance  with ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable laws. No outstanding stock options  of Buyer provide for a
deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of  the  Code and all
outstanding stock options of Buyer were granted with an exercise  price equal
to at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying Buyer  Common
Stock on the date such option was granted based upon a reasonable  valuation

term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by  the FRB.

 

 

4.16 _CRA,  Anti-money Laundering and Customer Information Security_. 
Neither  Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement with
any  individual or group regarding Community Reinvestment Act matters and
Buyer  is  not aware of, and none of Buyer and its Subsidiaries has been
advised of, or  has  any reason to believe (because the Buyer Banks' Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act  data for the year ended December 31, 2005, filed
with the FDIC, or otherwise)  that any facts or circumstances exist, which
would cause a Buyer Bank: (i)  to be  deemed not to be in satisfactory
compliance with the Community Reinvestment  Act,  and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for  Community
Reinvestment Act purposes by federal or state bank regulators of  lower 
than "satisfactory"; (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation of the
USA  Patriot Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by
the  U.S.  Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or
any other  applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or
(iii) to be  deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the applicable
privacy of  customer information requirements contained in any federal and
state privacy  laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title
V of the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and regulations promulgated
thereunder, as well  as the provisions of the information security program
adopted by the Buyer  Banks  pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364. Furthermore,
the Board of Directors of each  of  the Buyer Banks has adopted and each
such bank has implemented an anti-money  laundering program that contains
adequate and appropriate customer  identification verification procedures
that has not been deemed ineffective  by  any Governmental Authority and
that meets the requirements of Sections 352  and  326 of the USA Patriot
Act.

 

 

4.17 _Brokers_.  No  action has been taken by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries that would give rise  to any valid claim against Buyer for a
brokerage commission, finder's fee or  other like payment with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

4.18 _Deposit  Insurance_.  The  deposits of the Buyer Banks are insured by
the FDIC in accordance with the  FDIA  to the fullest extent permitted by
law, and each Buyer Bank has paid all  premiums and assessments and filed all
reports required by the FDIA. No  proceedings for the revocation or
termination of such deposit insurance are  pending or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, threatened.

 

 

4.19 _Sufficient  Funds_.  Buyer  has, and will have at the Effective Time,
sufficient funds to consummate the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment of the  aggregate Cash Consideration and the
consideration to be paid to the holders  of  Options in accordance with
Section 2.7, subject to the terms and conditions  of  this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.20 _Disclosure_.  No  representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, and no statement  contained in any certificate, list or other
writing, including but not  necessarily limited to the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule and, including, without  limitation, the Buyer SEC Documents as the
same may be updated as of the date  hereof, furnished to the Company pursuant

any material fact necessary to make the statements  therein not false or
misleading, it shall promptly inform the other party  thereof and shall take

6.5 _Access;  Information_. 

 

 

(a) Upon  reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of  information, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, afford  Buyer and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants, advisors
and other  authorized representatives (collectively, " _Buyer 
Representatives_ "),  access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the  Effective Time, to all of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and  records (including, without limitation, work
papers of independent auditors),  and to its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel or other representatives,  and, during such period, it
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish  promptly to such Buyer
and the Buyer Representatives (i) a copy of each material  report, schedule
and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements  of  federal or
state securities laws (other than reports or documents that the  Company, or
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, are not permitted to disclose  under
applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning the business, 
properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Buyer or any 
Buyer Representative may reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of 
its  Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information  where such access jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege of

binding agreement entered  into prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39

provisions of, the  Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.2(a)),

Buyer's obligation to  consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

6.6 _No  Solicitation_. 

 

 

(a) The  Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
respective officers,  directors, employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys,  accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
of the Company and its  Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 
Representatives_ ")  not  to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
induce or knowingly  encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making
of, any inquiry, offer  or  proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an  Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any

from, waive any provisions of, or fail to  enforce any confidentiality
agreement or standstill agreement to which the  Company is a party; or (iv)
enter into any agreement, agreement in principle  or  letter of intent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve  to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle  or  letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the  foregoing
restrictions by any of the Company Representatives, whether or not  such
Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Company 
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, 
shall  be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. The Company
and  its  Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Representatives to,  immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions,  negotiations, and communications with any Persons with
respect to any existing  or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition  Proposal_ " **** shall 
mean any inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or
proposal  from Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to,
or that  could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.
For  purposes of this Agreement, **** " _Acquisition  Transaction_
" shall  mean (A) any transaction or series of transactions involving any
merger,  consolidation, recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation,
dissolution or  similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (B) any  transaction pursuant to which any third party or group
acquires or would acquire  (whether through sale, lease or other
disposition), directly or indirectly,  any  assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate,  fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries  on a consolidated
basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of  (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar  transaction) securities
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase or  securities convertible into,
such securities) representing fifteen percent  (15%)  or more of the votes
attached to the outstanding securities of the Company  or  any of its
Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if  consummated,
would result in any third party or group beneficially owning  fifteen percent
(15%) or more of any class of equity securities of the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form,  substance or
purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination  of  the
foregoing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  Section 6.6(a), the Company may take any of the actions
described in clause  (ii)  of Section 6.6(a) if, but only if, (i) the
Company has received a bona fide  unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach  of  this Section 6.6; (ii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after  consultation with and having
considered the advice of its outside legal counsel  and a nationally
recognized, independent financial advisor, that (A) such  Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior  Proposal
and (B) it is required to take such actions to comply with its  fiduciary
duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law; (iii) the  Company
has provided Buyer with at least three (3) Business Days' prior notice  of
such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to 
any  information or data with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  or  otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
receives from such  Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to the Company  than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.  The  Company shall promptly provide to Buyer any non-public
information regarding  the  Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any
other Person which was not  previously provided to Buyer, such additional
information to be provided no  later than the date of provision of such
information to such other  party.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior  Proposal_ " shall  mean any
bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified  terms,
if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an  Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the Company Board determines in its good  faith
judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of 
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized 
reputation (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but 
not  less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock  or  all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  on  a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction
that (A) involves  consideration to the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock that is  more  favorable, from a financial point of view, than
the consideration to be paid  to  the Company's shareholders pursuant to
this Agreement, considering, among other  things, the nature of the
consideration being offered and any material  regulatory approvals or other
risks associated with the timing of the proposed  transaction beyond or in
addition to those specifically contemplated hereby,  and  which proposal is
not conditioned upon obtaining additional financing and (B)  is, in light of
the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the  Company's
shareholders than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed,  in each case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other  aspects of the proposal.

 

 

(c) The  Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify  Buyer in writing if any proposals or offers are received by,
any information  is  requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are
sought to be initiated  or  continued with, the Company or the Company
Representatives, in each case in  connection with any Acquisition Proposal,
and such notice shall indicate the  name of the Person initiating such
discussions or negotiations or making such  proposal, offer or information
request and the material terms and conditions  of  any proposals or offers
(and, in the case of written materials relating to  such  proposal, offer,
information request, negotiations or discussion, providing  copies of such
materials (including e-mails or other electronic communications)  unless (i)
such materials constitute confidential information of the party  making such
offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement,  (ii) 
disclosure of such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or
(iii)  disclosure of such materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation,
order,  judgment or decree. The Company agrees that it shall keep Buyer
informed, on  a  current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposal, offer, information  request, negotiations or discussions (including
any amendments or modifications  to such proposal, offer or request).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Neither  the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify or  modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Buyer  in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including  the Merger), the Company Recommendation, or make any
statement, filing or  release, in connection with the Company Meeting or
otherwise, inconsistent  with  the Company Recommendation (it being
understood that taking a neutral position  or no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered  an  adverse modification of the
Company Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend,  or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or  (iii) enter into (or cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter  into) any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or  other agreement (A) related
to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a  confidentiality agreement
entered into in accordance with the provisions of  Section 6.6(b)) or (B)
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail  to  consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  Section 6.6(d), prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company Board  may  approve or recommend to the shareholders of
the Company a Superior Proposal  and  withdraw, qualify or modify the
Company Recommendation in connection therewith  (a " _Company  Subsequent
Determination_ ")  after  the fifth (5th)  Business Day following Buyer's
receipt of a notice (the " _Notice  of Superior Proposal_ ")  from  the
Company advising Buyer that the Company Board has decided that a bona fide 
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not
result  from a breach of this Section 6.6) constitutes a Superior Proposal
(it being  understood that the Company shall be required to deliver a new
Notice of  Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from
such third  party or its affiliates that the Company proposes to accept) if,
but only if,  (i) the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith,
after  consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal
counsel  and  a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that
it is required  to  take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to
the Company's  shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the five (5)
Business Day Period  after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by
Buyer, the Company and  the  Company Board shall have cooperated and
negotiated in good faith with Buyer  to  make such adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions  of this Agreement as
would enable the Company to proceed with the Company  Recommendation without
a Company Subsequent Determination; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Buyer
shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications  or 
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the
end  of  such five (5) Business Day period, after taking into account any
such adjusted,  modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by Buyer
since its receipt  of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company Board has
again in good faith  made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section
6.6(e) and (B) that  such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or
modifying of the  Company Recommendation or the making of a Company
Subsequent Determination  by  the Company Board shall not change the
approval of the Company Board for  purposes of causing any Takeover Laws to
be inapplicable to this Agreement  and  the Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,  including the Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Nothing  contained in this Section 6.6 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board  from complying with the Company's obligations required under
Rules 14d-9 and  14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed a change  in the Company Recommendation unless the Company
Board reaffirms the Company  Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

 

6.7 _Affiliate  Agreements_.  Not  later than the 15th calendar day prior
to the mailing of the Proxy Statement,  the Company shall deliver to Buyer, a
schedule of each Person that, to the  best  of its knowledge, is or is
reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the  Company Meeting, deemed to be
an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning  of Rule 145 promulgated
under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its  reasonable best efforts
to cause each such person who may be deemed to be an  "affiliate" of the
Company within the meaning of Rule 145 to execute and deliver  to Buyer on or
before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement a written  agreement to
comply with the requirements of Rule 145 in connection with the  sale or
other transfer of Buyer Common Stock received in the Merger, in the  form 
attached hereto as _Exhibit  A_.

 

 

6.8 _Takeover  Laws_.  No  party shall take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Laws,  as  applicable, and each party shall take all
necessary steps within its control  to  exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability  of,  any applicable
Takeover Laws, as now or hereafter in effect, that purports  to  apply to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

6.9 _Shares  Listed_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain  approval for listing on the NYSE the
shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued  to the holders of the Company
Common Stock in the Merger.

 

 

6.10 _Regulatory  Applications; Filings; Consents_.  Buyer  and the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their  respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to prepare all documentation, to effect  all
filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations  of 
all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, 
the  Regulatory Approvals, (b) to comply with the terms and conditions of
such  permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and (c) to cause the
Merger  to  be consummated as expeditiously as practicable (including by
avoiding or setting  aside any preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order of any United  States federal or state court of competent jurisdiction
or any other  Governmental Authority); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in 
no event shall Buyer be required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or 
other requirement which would prohibit or materially limit the ownership or 
operation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or by Buyer or any of 
its  Subsidiaries, of all or any material portion of the business or assets
of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or
compel  Buyer  or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all
or any material  portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries  or  Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the "
_Burdensome  Conditions_ ").  Provided the Company has cooperated as
required above, Buyer agrees to file  the  requisite applications to be
filed by it with the FRB, FDIC, the Maine  Superintendent of Banks and the
Governmental Authorities of the states in which  Buyer, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries operate. Each of Buyer  and  the Company shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent  practicable each will
consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable  laws relating to
the exchange of information, with respect to, all material  written
information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority  in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In 
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act 
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it 
will  consult with the other parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of
all  material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties  and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other  parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of  the  transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.11 _Indemnification;  Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_. 

 

 

(a) Buyer  agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of
liability  existing in favor of any director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries  (the " _Indemnified  Parties_ ")  as  provided in the
Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the similar  governing
documents of the Company's Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date  hereof
(including, without limitation, the right to the advancement of expenses) 
with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall 
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any 
amendment thereto, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; 
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  all rights to indemnification in respect
of any Claim asserted or made within  such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such  Claim.

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period  endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability  insurance coverage for the Company's directors and
officers in a form acceptable  to the Company which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage  for  six (6) years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing  coverage under, and have other
terms not materially less favorable to, the  insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage  presently maintained
by the Company, so long as the aggregate cost is less  than  $150,000 (the "
_Premium  Limit_ ").  In  the event that the Premium Limit is insufficient
for such coverage, the Company  may enter into an agreement to spend up to
that amount to purchase such lesser  coverage as may be obtained with such
amount.

 

 

(c) In  the  event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges  into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation  or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all  or  substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in  each  such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that  the  successors
and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this  Section
6.11.

 

 

(d) The  provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and  to  grant third party rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified  Party  and his or her heirs and representatives.

6.12 _Employees  and Benefit Plans_. 

 

 

(a) From  and  after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to provide the
employees of the Company  and any of its Subsidiaries who remain employed
after the Effective Time  (collectively, the " _Company  Employees_ ") 
with  at least the types and levels of employee benefits (including
employee  contribution levels) comparable to those maintained by Buyer for 
similarly-situated employees of Buyer. Buyer will treat, and cause its 
applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Company Employees with 
the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries as service rendered to Buyer or any
of its  Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
for other  appropriate benefits including, but not limited to, applicability
of minimum  waiting periods for participation, but not for benefit accrual
under any defined  benefit plan (including minimum pension amount)
attributable to any period  before the Effective Time. Without limiting the
foregoing, but subject to the  terms and conditions of Buyer's health and
similar plans, Buyer shall not treat  any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a "new" employee for  purposes of any exclusions under
any health or similar plan of Buyer for a  pre-existing medical condition to
the extent that any such exclusion did not  apply under a health or similar
plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and  any  deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket expenses paid under any of the  Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' health plans shall be credited towards  deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket expenses under Buyer's health plans  upon delivery
to Buyer of appropriate documentation. Buyer will make appropriate 
arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall
have sole discretion  with  respect to the determination as to whether or
when to terminate, merge or  continue any employee benefit plans and programs
of the Company.

 

 

(c) Prior  to  the Effective Time, Buyer will allocate an aggregate of up to
$200,000 (the  " _Employee  Retention Amount_ ")  among  certain Company
Employees, and subject to such additional terms and conditions,  as Buyer and
the Company shall mutually agree. Each portion of the Employee  Retention
Amount that is allocated to a Company Employee will be paid in such  amounts,
at such times and upon such conditions as shall be set forth in letter 
agreements with each such Company Employee.

 

 

(d) At  and  following the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to honor the
severance guidelines  attached as _Schedule  6.12(d)_   in  connection
with the termination of employment of any Company Employee, in such  amounts,
at such times and upon such conditions as set forth on said Schedule. 

 

 

(e) The  Company shall use its best efforts to obtain from each of the
individuals named  in _Schedule  6.12(e)_ ,  an  agreement (a "
_Settlement  Agreement_ ")  to  accept in full settlement of his or her
rights under the specified programs  the  amounts and benefits determined
under his or her Settlement Agreement (the  aggregate amount of such payment
to be specified in _Schedule  6.12(e)_ )  and pay  such amounts to such
individuals who are employed at the Effective Time. Each  officer or employee
of the Company who is a party to a Settlement Agreement  shall be entitled to
receive the benefits payable or to be otherwise provided  under such
Settlement Agreement on the Closing Date, and Buyer agrees to provide  the
non-cash benefits provided in the Settlement Agreement, if any. In the 
case  of any employee who has executed and delivered a Settlement Agreement,
payment  of the monetary amounts specified for such person in _Schedule 
6.12(e)_   shall be  made by the Company or the Company Bank on the Closing
Date.

January  __, 2007

 

 



 

Chittenden  Corporation

 

Two  Burlington Square

 

Burlington,  Vermont 05401

 



 

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 



 

I  have  been advised that as of the date of this letter, I may be deemed to
be an  "affiliate" of Merrill Merchants Bancshares, Inc., a Maine corporation
(the " _Company_ "),  as  the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule  145 of the rules and regulations (the "
_Rules  and Regulations_ ")  of the  Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _Commission_ ")  under  the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Act_ ").  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as
of January  18, 2007 (the " _Merger  Agreement_ "),  by  and between the
Company and Chittenden Corporation, a Vermont corporation  (" _Buyer_ "), 
the  Company will be merged with and into Buyer (the " _Merger_ ").  As a 
result of the Merger, I may receive shares of common stock, par value $1.00 
per  share, of Buyer (" _Buyer  Common Stock_ ")  in  exchange for shares
of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company  (" _Company 
Common Stock_ ")  owned  by me.

 

 

Accordingly,  I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to Buyer that in the
event I receive  any shares of Buyer Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

 

 

           | A.  |  

I  shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any shares 
of  Buyer Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and 
Regulations.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

           | B.  |  

I  have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed 
the  requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations  upon
my  ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Buyer 
Common  Stock to the extent I believe necessary with my counsel or counsel 
for the  Company.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

           | C.  |  

I  have been advised that the issuance of the shares of Buyer Common  Stock
to  me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission  under
the  Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4. However,  I have
also  been advised that, because at the time the Merger will be submitted 
for a  vote of the shareholders of the Company, I may be deemed to be  an 
affiliate of the Company and the resale by me of the shares of  Buyer 
Common Stock will not be registered under the Act, I may not sell,  transfer
or otherwise dispose of any shares of Buyer Common Stock  issued  to me in
the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition  is  subject
to an effective registration statement and to the availability  of  a
prospectus under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition  is
made in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated under the Act,  (iii) a "no 
action" letter has been obtained on my behalf from the staff of the 
Commission indicating that it will not recommend enforcement action  to the 
Commission if such sale, transfer or other disposition is not subject  to 
an effective registration statement and to the availability of  a 
prospectus under the Act, or (iv) Buyer has received the written  opinion 
of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable  to 
Buyer, that such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise  exempt 
from registration under the Act.

           | D.  |  

I  understand that Buyer is under no obligation to register any sale, 
transfer or other disposition of shares of Buyer Common Stock received  in 
the Merger by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other  action 
necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such 
registration available.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

           | E.  |  

I  also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to 
Buyer's  transfer agent with respect to all shares of Buyer Common Stock 
issued to  me in the Merger and that there will be placed on the
certificates  for  such shares of Buyer Common Stock issued to me, or any
substitutions  therefor, a legend in substantially the following  form:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

"THE  SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH  RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
APPLIES,  AND  MAY ONLY BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN
COMPLIANCE WITH  THE  REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 145 OR PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER SAID  ACT  OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION."

 

 

           | F.  |  

I  further understand that unless the transfer by me of my shares  of
Buyer  Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made 
in  conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated under the  Act, 
Buyer reserves the right to place a legend on the certificates  issued to 
my transferee in substantially the following  form:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

"THE  SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO
RECEIVED  SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER
SAID ACT  APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A
VIEW TO,  OR FOR  RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN
THE MEANING OF  THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE
SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR  OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN
EXEMPTION FROM THE  REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT."

 

 

           | G.  |  

I  have set forth below the exact numbers of shares of Company Common 
Stock  which I own of record only, beneficially only and of record and 
beneficially. I represent and warrant to Buyer that I am the record  holder 
of all shares of Company Common Stock that I beneficially own,  except for 
shares of Company Common Stock that are held in "street name" for my 
benefit.

           | H.  |  

My  ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock indicated below  is
free  and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance, charge, 
equity,  claim or restriction whatsoever, except as set forth below and  as
may be  imposed by reason of the Act or the Rules and  Regulations.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

It  is  understood and agreed that the legends and stop orders referred to
above  will be  removed upon my request and compliance with such procedures
as Buyer or its  transfer agent may require, if Buyer has received (i)
reasonably satisfactory  written evidence that the shares of Buyer Common
Stock represented by any  such  certificate have been sold in compliance
with Rule 145(d) promulgated under  the Act, or (ii) a written opinion of
counsel, which opinion and counsel  shall  be reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, or a "no action" letter obtained by the  undersigned from the staff of
the Commission, to the effect that the  restrictions imposed by Rule 145
promulgated under the Act no longer apply  to  me.

 

 

Execution  of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part
that I am  an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph
of this letter or  as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any
claim that I am such  an  affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

 



 

This  letter shall terminate upon such date and time, if any, as the Merger
Agreement  shall be terminated pursuant to Article VIII thereof.

Very  truly yours,
