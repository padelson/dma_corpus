Agreement, the Major Shareholders and Company, on the one hand, and Merger Sub and Parent, on the other hand, shall each bear their own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, it being understood that in no event shall Company bear any of such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for half of all filing fees lawfully payable to or at the request of any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Major Shareholder
Documents, the Merger Sub Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including any filing under the HSR Act. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

would cause irreparable damage to Parent and that Parent will not have an adequate remedy at law and (ii)&nbsp;a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub would cause irreparable damage to Company and the Major Shareholders will not have an
adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, Company and the Major Shareholders under this Agreement, including the obligation of Company to Merge with Merger Sub, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;14.3 <U>Entire Agreement; Waivers; Amendments</U>. This Agreement
(including the schedules and exhibits hereto), the Major Shareholder Documents and the Merger Sub Documents represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought.
No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the
part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;
