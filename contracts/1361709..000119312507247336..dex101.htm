Shareholder shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate
or Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificate or
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates in order to obtain
payment in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby.
Each Certificate so surrendered shall be duly endorsed or otherwise
accompanied by a stock power or other instrument of transfer, in either case
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Parent. Each Company
Shareholder that is the registered holder of a Certificate shall be entitled
to receive from the Exchange Agent, upon surrender of such Certificate
(together with any other required documents) to the Exchange Agent, payment
without interest, of the portion of the Closing Purchase Price to which such
Company Shareholder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(k)_ hereof in
respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate. Each Certificate that is surrendered pursuant to this _Section
2.4(d)_ shall forthwith be canceled.

(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to such loss, theft or destruction
and to the ownership of such Certificate by the Company Shareholder claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the receipt by the Exchange
Agent of appropriate and customary indemnification, and the receipt by the
Exchange Agent of any other required documents (in each case, as reasonably
satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Parent), the Exchange Agent will pay
and distribute to such Company Shareholder, without interest, the portion of
the Closing Purchase Price to which such Company Shareholder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.2(k)_ hereof in respect of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that, prior to the Effective Time, any Company Shareholder transfers all
of his, her or its beneficial ownership and interest of and in any shares of
Company Common Stock to another Person, then any payment to which such Company
Shareholder would otherwise be entitled pursuant to the Merger in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock shall be paid to such other person  



 

15  and not to such Company Shareholder; _provided_ that (i) such Person
surrenders the appropriate Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock, duly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and (ii) such Company Shareholder shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of making any such payment to any such Person and such
Person not being the registered holder of such Certificate, or such Company
Shareholder shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and
Parent that any such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

(g) If any shareholders of Company exercise, perfect and/or reserve their
appraisal or dissenters rights pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
TBCA and if such shareholders of Company do not withdraw such shareholders
demand for appraisal prior to the expiration of the period of time during
which such shareholders of Company are permitted to effect such withdrawal
under the TBCA, then, upon the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Exchange Agent shall release to Parent the amount by which the Closing
Purchase Price exceeds the portion of the Closing Purchase Price to which all
Company Shareholders are entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.2(k)_ hereof.

Section 2.5 _Escrow_.

(a) At the Closing Parent shall deposit two letters of credit (each a "
_Letter of Credit_ ") issued by a bank or other reputable
financial institution, each of which Letters of Credit may be drawn upon in
the amount of $10,000,000 as described below (the $20,000,000 total amount to
be drawn upon under the Letters of Credit being referred to herein as the "
_Escrow Amount_ ") in escrow pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement in
the form of _Exhibit E_ hereto, with such changes thereto as may reasonably be
required by the escrow agent thereunder (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ")
among Parent, Company, the Shareholder Representative and a bank or other
financial institution reasonably satisfactory to Parent, Company and the
Shareholder Representative, as escrow agent thereunder (in such capacity, the
" _Escrow Agent_ ").

(b) If any shareholders of Company exercise, perfect and/or reserve their
appraisal or dissenters rights pursuant to, and in accordance with, the TBCA
and if such shareholders of Company do not withdraw such shareholders demand
for appraisal prior to the expiration of the period of time during which such
shareholders of Company are permitted to effect such withdrawal under the
TBCA, then, immediately after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent the amount by which the Escrow Amount
exceeds the Escrow Funds.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Escrow Funds_ " shall mean an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Escrow Amount,
without interest, by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the
Total Company Shares less the Dissenting Shares, and the denominator of which
shall be equal to the Total Company Shares.

(d) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent will draw
upon the first Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000,000 and will release
to the Shareholder Representative (for redistribution to the Company
Shareholders, as provided herein), in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement, an amount in cash equal to .5 multiplied by the Escrow Funds
(the " _Initial Escrow Release Amount_ "), less the total amount of  



 

16  settled and/or pending claims that have been made against the Escrow Funds
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of _Article 11_
hereof and the Escrow Agreement. In the event that any of the Initial Escrow
Release Amount is released to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 2.5(d)_, then each Company Shareholder shall be
entitled to receive from the Shareholder Representative that portion of any
such Initial Escrow Release Amount as shall be equal to (i) the quotient
obtained by dividing the amount of any such Initial Escrow Release Amount so
distributed by the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by all of
the Company Shareholders at the Effective Time (the " _Per Share Initial
Escrow Release Amount_ ") multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Company Shareholder at the Effective Time.
The Shareholder Representative shall be responsible to properly distribute any
such amounts to the Company Shareholders, and none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Escrow Agent shall have any responsibility for such
distribution, and the Company Shareholders shall look only to the Shareholder
Representative with respect to such distribution.

(e) On the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent will draw
upon the second Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000,000 and will release
to the Shareholder Representative (for redistribution to the Company
Shareholders, as provided herein), in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the Escrow Funds less the total
amount of the Initial Escrow Release Amount and less the total amount of
settled and/or pending claims that have been made against the Escrow Funds
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of _Article 12_ hereof and
the Escrow Agreement. In addition, at such time as all claims pending as of
the second anniversary of the Effective Time are resolved or paid, if any
Escrow Funds remain the Escrow Agent will release such remaining Escrow Funds
to the Shareholder Representative (for redistribution to the Company
Shareholders, as provided herein) in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement and this _Section 2.5(e)_. In the event that any of the
Escrow Funds are released to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to the
provisions of the first two sentences of this  _Section 2.5(e)_, then each
Company Shareholder shall be entitled to receive that portion of any such
Escrow Funds as shall be equal to (i) the quotient obtained by dividing the
amount of any such Escrow Funds so distributed by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by all of the Company Shareholders at the Effective
Time (the " _Per Share Escrow Amount_ ") multiplied by (ii) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Shareholder at the
Effective Time. The Shareholder Representative shall be responsible to
properly distribute any such amounts to the Company Shareholders, and none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent shall have
any responsibility for such distribution, and the Company Shareholders shall
look only to the Shareholder Representative with respect to such distribution.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock
held by shareholders of Company who have exercised and perfected and/or
reserved their appraisal or dissenters rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in
accordance with the TBCA, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement upon consummation of the Merger (or any amounts pursuant to _Section
2.5_ hereof), but, instead, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of the TBCA, unless and to the  



 

17  extent that any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have irrevocably
forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal under the TBCA or irrevocably
withdrawn his, her or its demand for appraisal. If any such holder of
Dissenting Shares has so irrevocably forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its
right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then, as of the occurrence of such
event, such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares
and shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect of such shares pursuant to this Agreement,
which payments shall be made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall set aside such amounts as needed to make such
payments.

Section 2.7 _No Further Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfer on the stock transfer books of Company of
any shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented (for transfer or otherwise) to the Surviving
Corporation or its transfer agent, such Certificate shall be canceled and,
subject to the procedures provided for in _Section 2.4_ hereof, payment shall
be made of the consideration provided for in this Agreement in respect of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

Section 2.8 _Termination of Rights_. After the Effective Time, holders of
Company Common Stock will cease to be, and will have no rights as,
shareholders of Company, and such holders rights will consist only of (a) in
the case of shares other than Dissenting Shares, the right to receive the
consideration provided for in this Agreement in respect of such shares, and
(b) in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights afforded to the holders
thereof under the applicable provisions of the TBCA. Until surrendered for
cancellation in accordance with the provisions of this Article 2, each stock
certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall, from and after
the Effective Time, represent (i) in the case of shares other than Dissenting
Shares, the right to receive the consideration provided for in this Agreement
in respect of such shares and (ii) in the case of Dissenting Shares, the
rights afforded to the holders thereof under the applicable provisions of
the TBCA.

Section 2.9 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

Section 2.10 _Appointment of Shareholder Representative_.

(a) In order to efficiently administer the transactions contemplated hereby,
Company hereby designates David Lloyd Norris as the Shareholder
Representative. The right of any Company Shareholder to receive all or
any portion of the Per Share Initial Escrow Release Amount or the Per Share
Escrow Amount is subject in all cases to the provisions of this _Section
2.10_. In addition, by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger by the Company Shareholders by written consent in lieu
of a meeting pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable provisions of
the TBCA, each Company Shareholder (regardless of whether or not such Company
Shareholder has voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger) that is not a holder of Dissenting Shares hereby
agrees that:



 

18 (i) Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be able to rely conclusively on the
instructions and decisions of the Shareholder Representative as to the
settlement of any claims against the Escrow Funds pursuant to _Articles 2_ and
_11_ hereof and the Escrow Agreement, or as to any other actions required or
permitted to be taken by the Shareholder Representative hereunder or under
the Escrow Agreement or the Cash Exchange Agreement, and no party hereunder
shall have any cause of action against Parent, the Escrow Agent or the
Exchange Agent to the extent Parent, the Escrow Agent or the Exchange Agent,
respectively, has relied upon the instructions or decisions of the Shareholder
Representative;

(ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Shareholder Representative
shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Company Shareholders and no
Company Shareholder shall have any cause of action against the
Shareholder Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction
given by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud
or willful misconduct by the Shareholder Representative;

(iii) the provisions of this _Section 2.10_ are independent and severable,
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Shareholder may have
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iv) remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this
_Section 2.10_ are inadequate; therefore, Parent, Merger Sub and/or the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive
relief without the necessity of proving damages if either Parent, Merger Sub
and/or the Surviving Corporation brings an action to enforce the provisions
of this _Section 2.10_; and

(v) the provisions of this _Section 2.10_ shall be binding upon the
executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor
trustees, and successors of each Company Shareholder, and any references in
this Agreement to a Company Shareholder or Company Shareholders shall mean and
include the successors to the Company Shareholders rights hereunder, whether
pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or
otherwise.

(b) The Company Shareholders hereby authorize the Shareholder Representative
to take any and all action as is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of
the Company Shareholders, and to assert the Company Shareholders rights
granted, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Cash Exchange Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) The Shareholder Representative may resign such position at any time,
effective with respect to each Company Shareholder immediately upon written
notice of such resignation delivered to Company by such resigning Shareholder
Representative. In the event that David Lloyd Norris, dies, becomes unable or
unwilling to perform his responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, James Randal Brooks shall fill such vacancy and shall be deemed to
be the Shareholder Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and
the documents delivered pursuant hereto. In the event that James Randal
Brooks, dies, becomes unable or  



 

19  unwilling to perform his responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, the Shareholder Representative shall by appointed by the
Major Shareholders (voting on a per-share-owned-immediately-prior-to-closing
basis).

(d) The Shareholder Representative will not be liable to the Company
Shareholders for any act taken or omitted by Shareholder Representative as
permitted under this Agreement and the post-Closing transactions contemplated
hereby, except if such act is taken or omitted in bad faith or by
willful misconduct. The Shareholder Representative will also be fully
protected against the Company Shareholders in relying upon any written notice,
demand, certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine
(including facsimiles thereof). 

(e) The Company Shareholders agree to indemnify, from and after the Closing,
the Shareholder Representative for, and to hold the Shareholder
Representative harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred
without willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Shareholder
Representative, arising out of or in connection with the Shareholder
Representative duties under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including costs and expenses of successfully defending the Shareholder
Representative against any claim of liability with respect thereto. The
Shareholder Representative may consult with counsel of its own choice and
will be fully protected for any action taken and suffered by it in good faith
and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of any state or foreign Law
with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

Parent Indemnified Party, such Parent Indemnified Party will effect any such
reimbursement payment by paying the applicable amount (i) to the Escrow Agent
if any Escrow Funds then remain in escrow (and such amount shall be added to
the Escrow Funds), or (ii) otherwise to the Shareholder Representative, in
which case such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
amounts of Escrow Funds released to the Shareholder Representative for the
benefit of the Company Shareholders in accordance with _Section 2.5(e)_
hereof.

Section 12.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. Except for claims or Legal
Proceedings relating to Taxes (which shall be governed by _Section 12.7_):

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by notice given as promptly as reasonably practicable; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give reasonably prompt notice shall
not preclude the indemnified party from any indemnification which it may claim
in accordance with this _Article 12_ , except to the extent the
indemnifying party can demonstrate material prejudice as a result of such
delay.

(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under _Section 12.3_ hereof (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the
assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered
by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The failure of the indemnified party to give
reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not preclude the
indemnified party from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance
with this _Article 12_ , except to the extent that the indemnifying party can
demonstrate material prejudice as a result of such delay. Subject to the
provisions of this _Section 12.4_, the indemnifying party shall have the
right, at its sole expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which
must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ that the
indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing to the
indemnified party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party as provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, it shall within five days
of the indemnified partys written notice of the assertion of such Third Party
Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify
the indemnified party of its intent to do so;  _provided_ , that the
indemnifying party must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard. If
the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its
election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party
may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with  



 

57  such Third Party Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Third Party
Claim, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for
the reasonable expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission
of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own
expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such
defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i)
so requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party that would make such separate representation advisable; and _provided_
, _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for
more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any
Third Party Claim. The parties hereto agree to provide reasonable access to
the other to such documents and information as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 12.4_ to the contrary,
neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the
written consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant or
claimants and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release
from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying
party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of
the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to an Third Party Claim
hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party
notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall pay all
of such remaining sums so due and owing to the indemnified party in accordance
with this  _Section 12.4_ and _Section 12.6_.

Section 12.5 _Limitations on Indemnification for Certain Losses_. 

(a) The Major Shareholders shall not have any liability under _Section
12.3(a)(i)_, _Section 12.3(a)(iii)_ or  _Section 12.3(a)(vii)_ hereof with
respect to the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Parent Indemnified
Parties (i) for any individual item, or group of items arising out of the same
event or related events, where the Loss relating thereto is less than $25,000
(the " _Sub-Basket_ ") and (ii) in respect of each individual item, or group
of items arising out of the same event or related events, where the Loss
relating thereto is equal to or greater than the Sub-Basket, unless the
aggregate amount of all Losses otherwise indemnifiable under _Section
12.3(a)(i)_, _Section 12.3(a)(iii)_ or _Section 12.3(a)(vii)_ but for this
clause (ii) exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ ") and then only to the extent
of such excess; _provided_ that the Basket and Sub-Basket limitation shall not
apply to Losses related to the failure to be true and correct of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_ (Authorization),
_3.3_ (Ownership), _3.5_ (Financial Advisors), _4.1_ (Organization), _4.2_
(Authorization), _4.4_ (Capitalization), _4.5_  



 

58  (Subsidiaries, but only insofar as such section relates to direct or
indirect ownership of all interests in the Subsidiaries by Company), _4.10_
 (Taxes), _4.23_ (Issuances and Repurchases of Securities), and _4.25_
(Financial Advisors) hereof.

(b) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or
warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants and agreements,
and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications in the representations or warranties shall be disregarded.

(c) The Major Shareholders shall have no right of contribution or other
recourse against Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, assigns
or successors for any Third Party Claims asserted by Parent Indemnified
Parties, it being acknowledged and agreed that the covenants and agreements
of Company are solely for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties.

(d) For any indemnity under  _Section 12.3(a)_ involving a Remedial Action
at a currently owned property, the indemnity shall be limited to those amounts
reasonably necessary to achieve the least stringent regulatory standard
acceptable to the relevant Governmental Authority under Environmental Law for
a property used for commercial/industrial purposes with restrictions
prohibiting the use of groundwater, but not requiring any type of engineering
controls or affirmative obligations on the part of the property owner to
maintain closure or NFA.

(e) Losses payable by an indemnifying party under this _Article 12_ , (i)
except with regard to Losses arising in connection with Third Party Claims,
shall not include punitive damages, consequential damages, damages related to
mental or emotional distress, exemplary damages, and special damages or other
indirect or incidental damages (other than lost profits or diminution in
value) and (ii) consisting of expenses of legal counsel, experts, engineers
and consultants, shall include (A) the actual amount of such expenses incurred
by third parties as sought by a Third Party Claim and (B) only the amount of
such other reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnified party.

Section 12.6 _Indemnity Escrow; Exclusivity of Escrow_. Any payment the Major
Shareholders are obligated to make to any Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this _Article 12_ shall be paid by release of funds to the Parent
Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Funds by the Escrow Agent. Except as
provided in the immediately following sentence, the right of the Parent
Indemnified Parties to indemnification under this _Article 12_ shall be
limited to the Escrow Funds and no Major Shareholder shall have any
personal liability for indemnification under this _Article 12._ The
limitation in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply in connection
with any Losses related to (i) the failure to be true and correct of any of
the representations in _Sections 3.3_ (Ownership), _4.4_ (Capitalization), or
_4.5_ (Subsidiaries, but only insofar as such section relates to direct or
indirect ownership of all interests in the Subsidiaries by Company), or (ii)
fraud or any intentional misrepresentation.



 

59 Section 12.7 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

(i) Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) timely file all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the Closing Date and shall

provide Parent with copies of such completed Tax Returns at least twenty days
prior to the due date for filing thereof, along with supporting workpapers,
for Parents review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If Parent does not deliver notice to Company of a disagreement
regarding a Tax Return within ten (10) days of Parents receipt thereof,
Parent shall be treated as having conclusively approved such return. Company
and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding
such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event that Company
and Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return
at least ten days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be
resolved pursuant to _Section 12.7(d)_, which resolution shall be binding on
the parties.

(ii) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns for taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date required
to be filed by Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and,
subject to the right to payment from the Escrow Funds under _Section
12.7(a)(iii)_, pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. Parent
shall provide Shareholder Representative with copies of such completed Tax
Returns at least twenty days prior to the due date for filing thereof, along
with supporting workpapers, for Shareholder Representatives review and
approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If Shareholder
Representative does not deliver notice to Parent of a disagreement regarding a
Tax Return within ten (10) days of Shareholder Representatives receipt
thereof, Shareholder Representative shall be treated as having conclusively
approved such return. Shareholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to
the due date for filing. In the event that Shareholder Representative and
Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return at
least ten days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be
resolved pursuant to _Section 12.7(d)_, which resolution shall be binding on
the parties.

(iii) Not later than ten days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes
on any Tax Returns which Parent has the responsibility to cause to be filed
pursuant to _Section 12.7(a)(ii)_, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent the
amount of Taxes, as reasonably determined by Parent, owed by the Major
Shareholders pursuant to the provisions of _Section 12.3(a)(v)_. No payment
pursuant to this _Section 12.7(a)(iii)_ shall excuse the Major Shareholders
from their indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 12.3(a)(v)_ if
the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise) for the
periods covered by such Tax Returns exceeds the amount of the payment under
this _Section 12.7(a)(iii)_.

  

 

60 (b) _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. In any case in which a Tax is assessed
with respect to a taxable period which includes June 2, 2007 (but does not
begin or end on that day) (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the Taxes, if any,
attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to the period up to
and including the close of business on June 2, 2007, on the one hand, and
(ii) to the period subsequent to June 2, 2007, on the other hand, by means of
a closing of the books and records of Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
close of June 2, 2007, provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to,
depreciation and amortization deductions) and Taxes that are assessed on a
periodic basis (such as real and personal property Taxes) shall be allocated
between the period ending on June 2, 2007 and the period after June 2, 2007 in
proportion to the number of days in each such period.

(c) _Tax Audits_.

(i) If notice of any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (a " _Tax Claim_ ") shall be received by either party for
which the other party may reasonably be expected to be liable pursuant to 
_Section 12.3_, the notified party shall notify such other party in writing
of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that the failure of the indemnified
party to give reasonably prompt notice as provided herein shall not release,
waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys obligations with respect
thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate
material prejudice as a result of such failure.

(ii) Company shall have the right, at the expense of the Major Shareholders to
the extent such Tax Claim is subject to indemnification by the Major
Shareholders pursuant to _Section 12.3(a)(v)_ hereof, to represent the
interests of Company and the Subsidiaries in any Tax Claim; provided, that,

accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Major Shareholders, on the one
hand, and Parent on the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is
not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall
be filed in the manner which the party responsible for preparing such Tax
Return deems correct without prejudice to the respective rights and
obligations of the parties hereto.

Section 12.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Major Shareholders and
Parent agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article
12_ as an adjustment to the purchase price for all income Tax purposes.



 

61 Section 12.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement or any failure to perform any
covenant in this Agreement prior to the Closing (other than, in any such case,
due to fraud or intentional misrepresentation) shall be indemnification in
accordance with this _Article 12_. Further, after Closing, Parent Indemnified
Parties do hereby release each Major Shareholder from any and all
Environmental Costs and Liabilities and any other claims, demands, and causes

have occurred by the close of business on such date; provided, that either
Parent or the Shareholder Representative shall have the option to extend, from
time to time, the Termination Date for additional periods of time not to
exceed 60 days in the aggregate if all other conditions to the Closing are

had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

 

(c) by the Shareholder Representative or Parent if there shall be in effect a
final nonappealable Order of a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby;

(d) by Parent if any Major Shareholder or Company shall have materially
breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of any Major Shareholder
or Company shall have become materially untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ or _9.2_ would not be satisfied and
such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall
not have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by the
Shareholder Representative of notice of such breach from Parent; or



 

62 (e) by the Shareholder Representative if Parent shall have materially breached
or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become
materially untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Sections 10.1_ or _10.2_ would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable
of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days following receipt by Parent of notice of such breach from the
Shareholder Representative.

(f) By Company, at any time prior to the expiration of thirty-five (35) days
from the date of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 7.5(c)_;
provided, that, in order for the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this paragraph (g) to be deemed effective, the Company shall have complied
with _Section 7.5(c)_ and with applicable requirements, including the
payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 13.3_.

Section 13.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination and
abandonment by Parent or the Shareholder Representative, or both, pursuant to
_Section 13.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party or parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Merger
hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Parent, Company or the
Major Shareholders.

Section 13.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated as provided herein, then each of the parties shall be
relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after
the date of such termination and such termination shall be without liability
to Parent, any Major Shareholder or Company; provided, however, (a) if this
Agreement is terminated by the Shareholder Representative or Parent pursuant
to  _Section 13.1(a)_ in a case where all conditions to the obligations of
the parties to effect the Closing other than the condition set forth in
_Section 9.15_ (Financing) were satisfied (or, in the case of such other
conditions that by their terms could not be satisfied until the Closing, such
conditions were capable of being so satisfied), then Parent shall pay to
Company within three Business Days of the termination an amount equal to
$500,000 plus the amount of all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), (b) if this Agreement is
terminated by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to _Section 13.1(f)_,
Parent shall pay the Parent Termination Fee to Company within three Business

13_ and  _Section 7.7_ hereof shall survive any such termination and shall
be enforceable hereunder, and (e) subject to the final sentence of this
_Section 13.3_, nothing in this _Section 13.3_ shall relieve Parent,
any Major Shareholder or Company of any liability for a breach of this
Agreement prior to the termination. The parties agree that the Parent
Termination Fee is a reasonable estimate of Companys damages, shall be
considered liquidated damages (not a penalty) and represents the maximum
liability of Parent and Merger Sub in the case of termination of this
Agreement.



 

63 ARTICLE XIV

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, it being
understood that in no event shall Company bear any of such costs and expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Company, on the one hand, and Parent,
on the other hand, shall each be responsible for half of all filing fees
lawfully payable to or at the request of any Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement, the Major Shareholder Documents, the Merger Sub

thereby, including any filing under the HSR Act.

Section 14.2 _Specific Performance_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, Company and
the Major Shareholders acknowledges and agrees that (i) a breach of this
Agreement by Company and the Major Shareholders would cause irreparable
damage to Parent and that Parent will not have an adequate remedy at law and
(ii) a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub would cause
irreparable damage to Company and the Major Shareholders will not have
an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub,

obligation of Company to Merge with Merger Sub, shall be enforceable by a
decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction,

Shareholder Documents and the Merger Sub Documents represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any
provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of
any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf
of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.
