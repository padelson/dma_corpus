WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company and Parent deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective
stockholders that the Company and Parent engage in a business combination in
order to, among other reasons, advance the long-term strategic business
interests of the Company and Parent;



WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub have approved the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the "

provide for certain actions relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the agreement of such stockholders to vote shares of
capital stock of the respective companies held by them in favor of the Merger;



WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and the

ARTICLE 2.

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:



(a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or 2.1(e)) shall
be converted, subject to Section 2.2(e), into the right to receive (i) $7.25
in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 1.3 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (" _Parent
Common Stock_ "), together with the associated Parent Rights (unless the
context otherwise required, all references to Parent Company Stock shall
include the associated Parent Rights) (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and
together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon
such conversion, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.



(b) _Parent-Owned Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(d) _Change in Shares_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, split,
combination, contribution or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio and Cash
Consideration, as applicable, shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.



(e) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
in the Company treasury and each share of Company Common Stock, if any, owned
by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.



 

4 (f) _Adjustments to Preserve Tax Treatment_. __



(i) If the amount obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate Parent Stock Value
by (y) the Closing Transaction Value is less than 0.4500, the following shall
occur:



(A) the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to a number, rounded to the nearest
fourth decimal place, equal to (x) the product of 0.4500 and the Closing
Transaction Value, divided by (y) the product of the Aggregate Company Share
Number and the Closing Parent Stock Price, and



(B) the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to an amount, rounded to the
nearest cent, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of
0.5500 and the Closing Transaction Value, by (y) the Aggregate Company Share
Number.



(ii) In the event that the Exchange Ratio and the Cash Consideration are
adjusted as provided for in this Section 2.1(f), all references in this
Agreement to the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and the " _Cash Consideration_ " shall
refer to the Exchange Ratio and the Cash Consideration as adjusted in this
Section 2.1(f) except as may be otherwise specified herein. 



(iii) For purposes of this Section 2.1(f), the following terms shall have the
following meanings:



(A) " _Aggregate Cash Amount_ " means the product of (x) the Cash
Consideration (before any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and (y) the
Aggregate Company Share Number.



(B) " _Aggregate Company Share Number_ " means the number obtained by
subtracting (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or 2.1(e) from (y) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of
the Effective Time.



(C) " _Aggregate Parent Share Number_ " means the product of (x) the Exchange
Ratio (before any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and (y) the Aggregate
Company Share Number.



(D) " _Aggregate Parent Stock Value_ " means the product of (x) the Aggregate
Parent Share Number (before any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) and
(y) the Closing Parent Stock Price.



(E) " _Closing Parent Stock Price_ " means the mean between the high and low
selling prices, regular way, of the Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq on the
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.



(F) " _Closing Transaction Value_ " means the sum of (x) the Aggregate Cash
Amount and (y) the Aggregate Parent Stock Value. 



(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section
2.1(f) shall have no force and effect, if, prior to the Effective Time, final
or temporary Treasury Regulations are promulgated or other guidance is issued
by the United States Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") upon which the
parties to this Agreement can rely, with an effective date prior to the
Effective Time, in substantially the same form or with substantially the same
effect of Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(2) (REG-129706-04;
August 10, 2004).



Section 2.2  _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint
Equiserve or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as the exchange agent hereunder (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). As of the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, converted pursuant to Section 2.1, for
exchange, in accordance with this Article 2, through the Exchange Agent,
sufficient cash and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to
make all deliveries pursuant to this Article 2; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the Exchange Fund (as defined below) shall for any reason not include
sufficient cash or certificates to make all such deliveries, upon notice
thereof from the Exchange Agent to Parent, Parent shall  



 

5  from time to time promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent sufficient cash
and certificates to make all such deliveries. The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 2.2(c),
2.2(e) and 2.2(i) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Any cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited
with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no more than ten (10) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Cash
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock, with a record date after the Effective Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), unless and until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date at or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.



(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any payments pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section
2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.



 

6 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share upon surrender for
exchange of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent
an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Market Value (as
defined below) of the Parent Common Stock. The "Market Value" of the Parent
Common Stock means the average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest cent) on Nasdaq for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on the second trading day immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as reported in the New York City edition of The Wall Street
Journal for each such trading day, or, if not reported therein, any other
authoritative source reasonably selected by Parent). Such payment shall occur
as soon as reasonably practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to each holder of Company Common Stock with respect
to any fractional shares and following compliance by such holder with the
exchange procedures set forth in Section 2.2(b) hereof and in the letter of
transmittal. No dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights
of a stockholder of Parent.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine
(9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case,
without any interest thereon.



(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.



(i) _Investment_. Parent may direct the Exchange Agent to invest any funds
(including any interest received with respect thereto) included in the
Exchange Fund which has not been distributed to holders of Certificates on
its behalf in interest-bearing securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock represented by Certificates hereunder.



(j) _Withholding_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.



 

7 Section 2.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except
as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time,
any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason
shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon. 



Section 2.4 _Stock Options_.



(a) _Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Generally_.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary such
that:



(i) Each Company Option outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share
equal to or greater than the Total Purchase Price Per Share shall be canceled
and the holder thereof shall have no right to receive any consideration
therefor;



(ii) Each Company Option outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share less
than the Total Purchase Price Per Share, whether or not vested or exercisable,
shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess,
if any, of the Total Purchase Price Per Share over the exercise price per
share subject to such Company Option (with the aggregate amount of
such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less
applicable withholding taxes, required to be withheld with respect to such
payment; and



(iii) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Restricted Company
Common Stock (as defined below), the restrictions of which have not lapsed
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and, subject
to Section 2.1(a), converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration under Section 2.1(a). " _Restricted Company Common Stock_
" shall mean a share of restricted Company Common Stock granted pursuant to
the terms of the Companys 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the " _2000
Plan_ ") and an accompanying Restricted Stock Award Notice under the 2000
Plan. 



(b) _Replacement Option Grants_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall take
all action necessary to facilitate Parents ability to, promptly following the
Closing Date, grant two (2) Parent Option Grants for each Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(i) or (ii), whether or not then exercisable (a "
_Replaced Option_ "), to each holder of a Replaced Option who is an officer,
director or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) immediately following the Closing,
which Parent Option Grants shall have an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the Parents common stock on the date of grant, collectively,
the " _Replacement Option Grants_ ") and promptly following the Closing Date,
Parent shall make such Replacement Option Grants. One of the Replacement
Option Grants shall be for the same number of shares, and shall be vested to
the same extent and vest according to the same vesting schedule as such
persons Replaced Option, and shall have the same term as set forth in
Parents standard form of stock option agreement as of the date hereof (the "
_First Replacement Option Grant_ "). __ The second of the Replacement Option
Grants shall be for that number of shares calculated by multiplying the number
of shares subject to each Replaced Option by the Implied All Stock Exchange
Ratio and subtracting the number of shares subject to the First Replacement
Option Grant and shall vest according to the vesting schedule and shall have
the same term as set forth in Parents standard form of stock option agreement
as of the date hereof (the " _Second Replacement Option Grant_ "). Except as
provided herein, all of the Replacement Option Grants shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of Parents stock option plan under which they are  



 

8  granted and Parents standard form of stock option agreement as of the date
hereof (including without limitation with regard to the duration
of exercisability following termination of employment).



(c)  _Reservation of Shares; Registration_. Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Parent Options granted
pursuant to Section 2.4(b). As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to such options to the fullest extent permitted by law and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding.



(d) _Company ESPP_. Each outstanding purchase right under the Companys
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") shall be exercised for
the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock at the price per share
determined pursuant to the Company ESPP on the date immediately prior to the
Closing Date, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Company ESPP (the "
_Final Offering Period_ "). Immediately following the Final Offering Period
and upon or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to provide that the Company ESPP shall be terminated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that no person will have any further right to
purchase Company Common Stock under the Company ESPP.



(e) _Parent Options and Parent ESPP Generally_. At the Effective Time, each
Parent Option then outstanding under the Parent Stock Option Plans
or otherwise (other than Parent Options granted pursuant to Section 2.4(b)),
whether or not then exercisable, shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the
Parent Option and, if applicable, the Parent Stock Option Plans and any
agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time. At and
following the Effective Time, Parents 1984 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
" _Parent ESPP_ ") shall remain in effect and each Parent Option outstanding
thereunder shall remain outstanding and be subject to the same terms and
conditions as set forth in the Parent ESPP and any agreements thereunder
immediately prior to the Effective Time. 



ARTICLE 3.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the Disclosure Letter
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (and subject to Section 9.14 hereof),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:



Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or properties
or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent a
complete and correct copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
other organizational documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
each as amended to date. Except with respect to securities of non-affiliates
held for investment purposes which do not constitute more than a 1% interest
in any such non-affiliate and with respect to the capital stock of wholly-
owned Company Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
holds an Equity Interest in any other person. The articles of incorporation
and bylaws (or other organizational documents) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries made available are in full force and effect. Section 3.1 of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each
jurisdiction where the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is organized and
qualified to do business.



 

9 Section 3.2 _Capitalization_.



(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 300,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_
"). As of June 13, 2005 (i) 70,061,481 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued and fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and (ii) 8,546,595 shares of
Company Common Stock were issuable (and such number was reserved for issuance)
upon exercise of Company Options outstanding as of such date. As of the date
hereof, no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding.



(b) Except for outstanding Company Options and outstanding purchase rights
under the Company ESPP, as of the date hereof, there are no options, warrants
or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or other Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any
shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests. From June 13, 2005 to
the date of this Agreement, the Company has not issued any Equity Interests
with respect to Company Common Stock, other than Company Common Stock issued
upon exercise of Company Stock Options and Company Common Stock issued in the
ordinary course of business pursuant to the Company ESPP. Section 3.2(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list, as of June
13, 2005, of the prices at which outstanding Company Options may be exercised
under the Company Stock Option Plans, the number of Company Options
outstanding at each such price and the vesting schedule of the Company
Options. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance under the
Company Stock Option Plans, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the
terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are
issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights.



(c) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (i) restricting the transfer of, (ii) affecting the
voting rights of, (iii) requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition
of, or containing any right of first refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring
the registration for sale of, or (v) granting any preemptive or antidilutive
right with respect to, any Company Common Stock or any capital stock of, or
other Equity Interests in, any Company Subsidiary. Each outstanding share of
capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned,
beneficially and of record, by the Company free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on the Companys voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to make any loan to, or
any equity or other investment (in the form of a capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other person, other than
guarantees by the Company of any indebtedness or other obligations of any
wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and other than loans made in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Company has not adopted a stockholder rights plan.



(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to
vote) with the stockholders of the Company or any Company Subsidiary on any
matter.



Section 3.3 _Authority_.



(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject in the
case of the consummation of the Merger to the approval of this Agreement by
the holders of a majority of the votes cast by all holders of Company Common
Stock entitled to vote thereon (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of such transactions have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action and no  



 

10  other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and no stockholder
votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate such
transactions, subject only to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval.

against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general principles of equity.



(b) The Company has duly and validly taken all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company to render inapplicable to the Company the
provisions of Subchapters E, G, H, I and J of Chapter 25 of the PBCL.



(c) The board of directors of the Company, by resolutions duly adopted by
unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held and, except to the extent
contemplated by Section 6.4, not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way
(the " _Company Board Approval_ "), has duly (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger, and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of the
Company adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and directed
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted for
consideration by the Companys stockholders in accordance with this Agreement.

that purport to restrict business combinations, including, without
limitation, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_
") and Section 2538 of Subchapter 25D and Subchapter 25F (§§ 2551-2556) of the
PBCL (each a " _Takeover Law_ "), and no such Takeover Law is applicable to
this Agreement or the Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including the Merger.



(d) The board of directors of the Company has received the opinion of each of
its financial advisors, Lehman Brothers Inc and Piper Jaffray and Co. (the "
_Company Financial Advisors_ "), dated the date, or shortly prior to the date,
of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
stockholders of the Company.



Section 3.4  _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._



(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with
or violate any provision of (A) the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date hereof (the " _Company
Articles_ "), (B) the Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof
(the " _Company Bylaws_ "), or (C) any equivalent organizational documents of
any Company Subsidiary, or (ii) require any consent or approval under,
violate, result in any breach of, any loss of any benefit under or constitute
a change of control or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a lien or other encumbrance (other than a Permitted Lien) on
any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to,
any Law, Contract, Company Permit or other instrument or obligation, except,
with respect to clause (i)(C) or clause (ii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any domestic or foreign Governmental Entity, except (i) under the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act, any applicable Blue Sky Law, the rules and
regulations of Nasdaq and pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof, the filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Pennsylvania Secretary of State, (ii) any filings
necessary under the HSR Act or foreign antitrust laws and regulations, and
(iii) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

11 Section 3.5 _Permits; Compliance With Law_. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all authorizations, licenses,
permits, certificates, approvals and clearances, and has submitted notices to,
all Governmental Entities necessary for the Company or any Company Subsidiary
to own, lease and operate its properties or other assets and to carry on
their respective businesses in the manner described in the Company SEC Filings
filed prior to the date hereof and as it is being conducted as of the date
hereof (the " _Company Permits_ "), and all such Company Permits are valid,
and in full force and effect, except where the failure to have, or the
suspension or cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full force and
effect of, any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of,
(a) any Law (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (b) any Company
Permits, except, with respect to clauses (a) and (b), for any such conflicts,
defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is, to the Knowledge of the Company, pending or threatened, nor
has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same.



Section 3.6 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) The Company has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses,
forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required
to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, since June 29, 2003 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ ").
Each Company SEC Filing (i) as of its date, complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, (ii) did not at the time of filing, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (iii) with
respect to each Company SEC Filing filed for fiscal periods ending after July
30, 2002, at the time filed included or was accompanied by the certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOXA_ ") to be filed or
submitted by the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer (each of which certification was true and correct and fully complied
with the SOXA) and otherwise complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the SOXA.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings was prepared in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a consistent
basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto), and each presented fairly the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which did not and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect). The books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and all other applicable legal and accounting requirements. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
all documents governing all material "off balance arrangements" (as defined
by item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) in respect of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.



(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of July 3,
2004 included in the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2004,
including the notes thereto (the " _Company Form 10-K_ "), neither the Company
nor any consolidated Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of
any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be
required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for (i) liabilities or obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with  



 

12  past practice since July 3, 2004, (ii) liabilities and obligations incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (iii) liabilities and obligations that taken individually, or in the
aggregate, are not material in amount or significance.



(d) The Company has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as

(e) there is no suit or investigation pending and, to the Companys
Knowledge, no suit or investigation threatened against the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Government Contract;



except to the extent that any such circumstance would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 



ARTICLE 4.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB



Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the Disclosure Letter
delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (and subject to Section 9.14 hereof),
Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:



 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, and is qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where
the ownership or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy
of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other organizational
documents) of Parent and the  



 

20  Parent Subsidiaries, each as amended to date. Except with respect to
securities of non-affiliates held for investment purposes which do not
constitute more than a 1% interest in any such non-affiliate and with respect
to the capital stock of wholly-owned Parent Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any other person. The
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other organizational documents)
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries made available are in full force and
effect. Section 4.1 of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list of each jurisdiction where Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
is organized and qualified to do business.



Section 4.2 _Capitalization._



(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
350,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Parent Preferred Stock_ "), of which
1,000,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock. As of June 13, 2005, (i) 106,822,919 shares of Parent Common
Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued and fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and (ii) 19,606,373 shares
of Parent Common Stock were issuable (and such number was reserved for
issuance) upon exercise of Parent Options outstanding as of such date. As of
the date hereof, (i) 1,000,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock have been reserved for issuance in connection with the Parent
Rights, and (ii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock are issued or
outstanding.



(b) Except for outstanding Parent Options, outstanding purchase rights under
Parents Employee Stock Purchase Plan and outstanding Parent Rights under the
Parent Rights Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no options, warrants
or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to
which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or
other Equity Interests of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or obligating
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests. From June 13, 2005 to the date of
this Agreement, Parent has not issued any Equity Interests with respect to
Parent Common Stock, other than Parent Common Stock issued upon exercise of
Parent Stock Options and Parent Common Stock issued in the ordinary course of
business pursuant to the Parent ESPP. Section 4.2(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter sets forth a true and complete list, as of June 13, 2005, of the prices
at which outstanding Parent Options may be exercised under the applicable
Parent Stock Option Plans, the number of Parent Options outstanding at each
such price and the vesting schedule of the Parent Options. All shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to issuance under the Parent Stock Option Plans,
upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. 



(c) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary (i) restricting the transfer of, (ii) affecting the voting rights
of, (iii) requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or
containing any right of first refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring the
registration for sale of, or (v) granting any preemptive or antidilutive
right with respect to, any Parent Common Stock or any capital stock of, or
other Equity Interests in, any Parent Subsidiary. Each outstanding share of
capital stock of each Parent Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned,
beneficially and of record, by Parent free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on Parents voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to make any loan to, or any
equity or other investment (in the form of a capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Parent Subsidiary or any other person, other than
guarantees by Parent of any indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly-
owned Parent Subsidiary and other than loans made in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice to employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.



(d) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to
vote) with the stockholders of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary on any matter.



 

21 Section 4.3 _Authority_.



(a) Parent has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the
approval by the stockholders of Parent, by a majority of the votes cast by all
holders of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, of the Share Issuance (the " _Parent Stockholder
Approval_ "). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the
consummation by Parent of such transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent and no stockholder votes are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate such transactions, subject only to
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval. This Agreement is the valid and
binding agreement of Parent enforceable against Parent in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general principles of equity.



(b) The board of directors of Parent, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous
vote at a meeting duly called and held and, except to the extent contemplated
by Section 6.4, not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the "
_Parent Board Approval_ "), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and
the Merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Parent and
its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, the Merger and the
Share Issuance, and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of Parent approve
the Share Issuance (the " _Parent Recommendation_ ") and directed that the
Share Issuance be submitted for consideration by Parents stockholders in
accordance with this Agreement. The Parent Board Approval constitutes or
includes approval of this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger and
the Share Issuance, as required under any applicable Takeover Law, and no such
Takeover Law is applicable to this Agreement or the Voting Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger and the
Share Issuance.



(c) The board of directors of Parent has received the opinion of its financial
advisor, Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated (the " _Parent Financial Advisor_
"), dated the date, or shortly prior to the date, of this Agreement, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to Parent.



Section 4.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by Parent will not, (i) conflict with
or violate any provision of (A) the Parent Certificate, (B) the bylaws of
Parent as in effect on the date hereof, or (C) any equivalent organizational
documents of any Parent Subsidiary, or (ii) require any consent or approval
under, violate, result in any breach of, any loss of any benefit under or
constitute a change of control or default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance (other than a Permitted
Lien) on any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary pursuant to,
any Law, Contract, Parent Permit or other instrument or obligation, except,
with respect to clause (i)(C) or clause (ii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by Parent will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
domestic or foreign Governmental Entity, except (i) under the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act, any applicable Blue Sky Law, the rules and regulations of
Nasdaq and pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof, the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Pennsylvania Secretary of State (ii) any filings necessary
under the HSR Act or foreign antitrust laws and regulations, and (iii) where
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



 

22 Section 4.5 _Permits; Compliance With Law_. Each of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,
certificates, approvals and clearances, and has submitted notices to, all
Governmental Entities necessary for Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own,
lease and operate its properties or other assets and to carry on their
respective businesses in the manner described in the Parent SEC Filings filed
prior to the date hereof and as it is being conducted as of the date hereof
(the " _Parent Permits_ "), and all such Parent Permits are valid, and in
full force and effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of
the Parent Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (a) any Law (including the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) applicable to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
or by which any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is bound
or affected or (b) any Parent Permits, except, with respect to clauses (a) and
(b), for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries is, to the Knowledge of Parent, pending or
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same.



Section 4.6 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements._



(a) Parent has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,
reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required to be
filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
since March 31, 2003 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each
Parent SEC Filing (i) as of its date, complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, (ii) did not, at the time of filing, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (iii) with
respect to each Parent SEC Filing filed for fiscal periods ending after July
30, 2002, at the time filed included or was accompanied by the certifications
required by the SOXA to be filed or submitted by Parents principal
executive officer and principal financial officer (each of which
certification was true and correct and fully complied with the SOXA) and
otherwise complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the SOXA.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Filings was prepared in
all material respects in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto), and each presented fairly the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of Parent and the consolidated
Parent Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments which did not and would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect). The
books and records of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and all
other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Parent has made available
to the Company complete and correct copies of all documents governing all
material "off balance arrangements" (as defined by item 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) in respect of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary.



(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet
of Parent and the consolidated Parent Subsidiaries as of March 28, 2004
included in Parents Form 10-K for the year ended March 28, 2004, including
the notes thereto (the " _Parent Form 10-K_ "), neither Parent nor any
consolidated Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 28,
2004, (ii) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) liabilities and
obligations that taken individually, or in the aggregate, are not material in
amount or significance.

in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required in order for
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent to engage in
the review and evaluation process mandated by Section 302 of the SOXA.
Parents "disclosure controls and procedures" are designed to ensure at a
reasonable assurance level that material information (both financial and non-
financial) relating to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
of Parent required by Section 302 of SOXA with respect to such reports.



Section 4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since March 28, 2004,
except as disclosed in the Parent Form 10-K or in Parent SEC Filings since
March 28, 2004 through to the date of this Agreement, including the notes
thereto, and except as specifically contemplated by, or as disclosed in, this
Agreement, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses

substitution for, shares of its respective capital stock; (e) any
material revaluation by the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary of any of their
assets or (f) any material loss of the Parent Intellectual Property taken as a
whole that is owned by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

(b) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and all applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and contributions and premium payments
required to be made under the terms of any of the Parent Benefit Plans as of
the date of this Agreement have been timely made. With respect to the Parent
Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Parent or

or any other applicable Law, and neither Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate has

letter from the IRS that the Parent Benefit Plan is so qualified and all
related trusts are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, nothing has
occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which could be reasonably
expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Parent or a
Parent Subsidiary, (i) there has been no prohibited transaction (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other than a
transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption)

brought, or to the Knowledge of Parent is threatened, against or with respect

the Knowledge of Parent, there is no basis for any such suit, administrative
proceeding, action, claim or litigation, (iii) none of the assets of Parent,

has any actual or contingent liability with respect to, any "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any "multiemployer plan" as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA.



(e) No amount that would be reasonably expected to be received (whether
in cash or property or the vesting of property), in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by any
employee, officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Parent Benefit Plan or otherwise may be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code). 



(f) Except as required under COBRA, no Parent Benefit Plan provides any of
the following retiree or post-employment benefits to any person: medical,

the requirements of COBRA,  



 

25  and (ii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and

United States source income outside of the United States (each, a " _Parent
Foreign Benefit Plan_ "). Each Parent Foreign Benefit Plan has been
maintained, funded and administered in compliance in all material respects
with all Laws applicable thereto and the respective requirements of such
Parent Foreign Benefit Plans governing documents, and no Parent Foreign
Benefit Plan has any unfunded or underfunded liabilities.



(h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to or otherwise bound
by any collective bargaining Contract with a labor union or
labor organization, nor is any such Contract presently being negotiated.



(i) Parent has identified in Section 4.8(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter
and has made available to the Company true and complete copies of (i) all

Subsidiary with or relating to its employees, and (iii) all plans, programs,
agreements and other arrangements of each of Parent and each Parent
Subsidiary with or relating to its directors, officers, employees or
consultants which contain change in control provisions. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or other related agreements, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of
employment) (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, parachute or otherwise) becoming due to
any director or any employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or Affiliate
from Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or Affiliate under any Parent Benefit
Plan or otherwise, (ii) significantly increase any benefits otherwise payable

SEC Filings filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or as disclosed in
Section 4.9 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any
Contract (each a " _Parent Material Contract_ ") that (i) is a "material

Contract with an Affiliate of Parent, or (iii) limits or otherwise restricts
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or that would, after the Effective Time, limit
or restrict Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or any successor thereto, from engaging or
competing in any line of business or in any geographic area. To Parents
Knowledge, none of the contracts or agreements referred to in the foregoing
clause (iii) would preclude the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent after Closing from engaging in any of its current activities, or
presently planned material activities of which Parent is aware. All Parent
Material Contracts are valid and in full force and effect except to the extent
they have previously expired in accordance with their terms, and neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has violated any provision of, or committed
or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse or time, or
both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a material default under the
provisions of any such Parent Material Contract. To the Knowledge of Parent,
no counterparty to any such Parent Material Contract has violated any
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with
our without notice, lapse of time, or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute a material default or other breach under the

to Company and such copies are accurate and complete.

proceeding or investigation pending or threatened against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or for which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is obligated to
indemnify a third party, and (b) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is
subject to any outstanding and unsatisfied order, writ, injunction, decree or
arbitration ruling, award or other finding.

aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received within the past five
(5) years any written notice, demand, letter, claim or request for information
alleging that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is or may be in material
violation of, or has any material liability under, any Environmental Law.

decree or order, is a party to any litigation or other proceeding, or is
subject to any judgment, decree or judicial order, relating to Environmental

treatment, remediation, removal or cleanup of Hazardous Materials and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no such consent decree, order, litigation or other
proceeding, judgment, decree or judicial order is pending or threatened or

other person with respect to any claim actually threatened or asserted against
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and relating to any Environmental Law or any
Hazardous Materials.

stored, transported, disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of,
handled, released, or exposed any person to, any Hazardous Materials, or
owned or operated any property or facility (and no such property or facility
is contaminated by any Hazardous Materials) in a manner that has given or
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any liabilities pursuant to

Section 4.13 _Taxes_. 



(a) Each of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed with the
appropriate Tax authorities or other Governmental Entities all material Tax
Returns that it was required to file through the date hereof. All such Tax
Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. All
material Taxes due and owing by any of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether
or not shown on any Tax Returns) have been paid or provided for. Neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any extension
of time within which to file any material Tax Return. No written claim has
ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where any of Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.



(b) The unpaid Taxes of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries did not, as of
the dates of the most recent financial statements contained in Parent SEC
Filings, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than in any notes
thereto) contained in such financial statements by a material amount. Since
the date of the most recent financial statements, none of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course
of business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.



(c) No unresolved deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any of Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed or assessed by a Tax
authority. To the knowledge of Parent, there are no pending, proposed or
threatened audits, investigations, disputes or claims or other actions for or
relating to any liability for Taxes with respect to any of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries. No issues relating to Taxes of any of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax authority in any completed audit
or examination that would reasonably be expected to recur in a later Tax
period. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company complete and
accurate copies of federal, state and local income Tax Returns of each of
Parent and Parent Subsidiaries and their predecessors for the previous four
fiscal years, and complete and accurate copies of all examination reports
and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by any of Parent
and Parent Subsidiaries or any predecessors since December 31, 2000, with
respect to Taxes of any type. Neither Parent nor any of Parent Subsidiaries
nor any predecessor has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes
or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of any of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens.



(d) Each of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
other third party, and all Tax Returns required with respect thereto
have been properly completed and timely filed in all material respects.



(e) Except for the affiliated group of which Parent is the common parent, each
of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries is not and has never been a member of an
affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of  



 

28  Section 1504 of the Code or any group that has filed a combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return. Neither Parent nor any of Parent
Subsidiaries has liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries) (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or
successor, (iii) by contract or (iv) otherwise.



(f) There are no Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements (including
indemnity arrangements) with respect to or involving any of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries and, after the Effective Time, none of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries shall be bound by any such Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods prior to the Effective Time.



(g) None of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries: (i) has consented at any time
under former Section 341(f)(1) of the Code to have the provisions of
former Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition of the assets
of Parent (or under any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law);
(ii) has agreed, or is or was required, to make any adjustment under Section
481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise
(or by reason of any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), except
for adjustments the resulting Tax consequences of which have been fully and
completely taken into account in previously filed Tax Returns; or (iii) has
ever been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning
of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.



(h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock qualifying under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior
to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that includes the Merger.



(i) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been a party to a "reportable
transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(1) or to a transaction that is or is substantially similar to a
"listed transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(2), or any other transaction requiring disclosure under
analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Parent has disclosed
on its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give
rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning
of Code Section 6662. 



(j) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has taken any action or knows of
any fact that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.



Section 4.14 _Insurance_. Section 4.14 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets
forth a summary of all material insurance policies maintained by Parent,
including fire and casualty, general liability, product liability, business
interruption and professional liability policies. Such coverage, or
substantially similar coverage, has been in force without
interruption throughout the five-year period preceding the date hereof.



Section 4.15 _Properties_. Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has good
and valid title to or a valid leasehold interest in all its properties and
assets reflected on the most recent balance sheet contained in the Parent
Form 10-K or acquired after the date thereof, except for properties and
assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since
the date of such balance sheet. All of such tangible properties and assets
have been maintained in the ordinary course of business and are in operable
condition (normal wear and tear excepted), except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All real property
owned by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is owned free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens.



Section 4.16 _Labor and Employment Matters_. With respect to Parent and each
Parent Subsidiary (i) there are no controversies, charges of unlawful

harassment or discrimination pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,

Effect, (ii) there is no collective bargaining agreement or other labor union
contract applicable to persons employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary,

Parent Material Adverse Effect, (iv) there is no strike, slowdown, work
stoppage or lockout, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any threat thereof, in
each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (v) within the past three (3) years there
has been no plant closing or layoff of employees by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in violation of the WARN Act except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



Section 4.17 _Parent Rights Agreement_. Parent has taken all necessary action,
including entering into an amendment to the Parent Rights Agreement, if
necessary, so that neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Voting Agreements nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including the Merger, will cause (i) the Parent Rights to
become exercisable under the Parent Rights Agreement; (ii) the Company or any
of its stockholders to be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the
Parent Rights Agreement); (iii) any of the rights under Section 11 or Section
13 of the Parent Rights Agreement to arise or be triggered or any event
described in Section 11 or Section 13 of the Parent Rights Agreement to be
deemed to have occurred; or (iv) the "Shares Acquisition Date" or the
"Distribution Date" (each as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) to occur
upon any such event. Parent has provided to the Company a true and complete
copy of the Parent Rights Agreement, as amended to date.



Section 4.18 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than the
Parent Financial Advisor) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee
or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or

authorized by all necessary corporate action, including by action of its
board of directors and stockholders, and no other corporate proceedings on the

person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with it or
any of its Affiliates (for all purposes of references to Affiliates in this
sentence, excluding Bain Capital, Inc. and its Affiliates and Bear, Stearns and
Co. Inc. and its Affiliates) or Subsidiaries or any of its or its Affiliates
or Subsidiaries Representatives since January 1, 2002 with respect to such

for the purposes of this sentence only, shall substitute for each reference to
"80%" and "20%" appearing therein, "75%" and "25%", respectively)
to immediately return or destroy (and have such destruction certified in
writing by such person to such party hereunder) all confidential information
heretofore furnished by such party or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or
any of its or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries Representatives to such person

be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, such party shall provide the
other party with written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the person or
group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and a copy of
all written materials provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,

such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly provide to
it a copy of all written materials subsequently provided in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.



 

39 (c) If, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting in the case of the Company
or Parent Stockholders Meeting in the case of Parent, (x) either the Company
or Parent receives an Acquisition Proposal (for purposes of the procedures set
forth in this Section 6.4(c), any Acquisition Proposal received prior to the
date hereof and which is still outstanding as of the date hereof shall be
deemed to have been received immediately after execution and delivery hereof
and any amendment to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal shall constitutes a
new Acquisition Proposal) which constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (y) such
partys board of directors (or any committee thereof charged with such
authority) has concluded in good faith, based at least in part on the advice
of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take some or all of the
actions set forth in clause (1) or clause (2) below with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable Law, such party
shall promptly, but in any event in less than one (1) day following the date
of such conclusion (but in any event prior to taking the actions set forth in
(1) and (2) below), provide to the other party hereunder written notice that
shall state expressly (A) that it has received an Acquisition Proposal which
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) that such partys board of directors (or
a committee thereof charged with such authority) has made the conclusions set
forth in clause (y) above and (C) the identity of the party making such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal (such notice, the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") and may then take
the following actions:



(1) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, provided, that (x) prior to so furnishing, the furnishing party
receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms no more favorable to the third party than the terms under
the Confidentiality Agreement and customary standstill provisions and (y)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third
party, the furnishing party furnishes a copy of such nonpublic information to
the other party hereunder (to the extent such nonpublic information has not
been previously so furnished); and



(2) engage in discussions and/or negotiations with the third party with
respect to the Acquisition Proposal.



(d) In response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not
been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after
compliance by the party receiving the Superior Proposal with this Section
6.4(d), the board of directors (or any committee thereof charged with such
authority) of such party may (x) withhold or withdraw the Company
Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as the case may be or (y)
approve, adopt, endorse or recommend to its stockholders a Superior Proposal
(any of the foregoing actions, whether by the board of directors or a
committee thereof, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), only if all of the
following conditions are met:



(i) the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as
the case may be, has not occurred;



(ii) the board of directors (or any committee thereof charged with such
authority) of such party has concluded in good faith, based at least in part
on advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Proposal, the failure of the board of directors to effect a Change
of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable Law; and



(iii) the board of directors of such party has (A) provided to the other party
hereto five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intent to effect a
Change of Recommendation (which notice shall include reasonable details of the
applicable Superior Proposal and the manner in which it intends to effect the
Change of Recommendation), (B) made available to the other party hereto all
materials and information made available to the person making the Superior
Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal, _and_ (C) for such five
(5) Business Day period following the delivery to the other party of such
notice and the provision of the materials and information referred to in (B)
above, such party shall, if requested by the other party, negotiate in good
faith with the other party to revise this Agreement with the goal that the
Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal would no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal.



 

40 (e) Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it shall not submit to the vote
of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal) or propose to do so. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to restrict the Company or Parent from complying with Rules 14d-9 or
14e-2 under the Exchange Act or be deemed to restrict the Company or Parent
from making such other disclosures as may be required by federal securities
laws or applicable fiduciary duties.



(f) It is understood and agreed that the Company, its board of directors (or
any committee thereof charged with applicable authority) and its
outside legal counsel shall be entitled to rely on and deem applicable to the
Company and its board of directors the Law applicable to corporations
incorporated in Delaware for purposes of making the conclusions contemplated
by this Section 6.4 (and providing advice with respect thereto) relating to
the fiduciary obligations of such person. The immediately preceding sentence
is intended only to govern the contractual rights of the parties to this
Agreement; it being understood and agreed that nothing in this Agreement is
intended to modify any fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors or
any committee thereof under applicable Law.

contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable, (ii)
obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required (A) to be obtained or
made by Parent or the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries, and (B)
to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including, without
limitation, the Merger, (iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, any other applicable
federal or state securities Laws, and any other applicable Law and (iv)
contest and defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement cannot otherwise be consummated,
each of Parent and the Company shall effect divestitures, hold separate and
license arrangements that are reasonable in the aggregate. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all
filings referenced in this paragraph, including providing copies of all such

requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested

to applicable confidentiality agreements and other confidentiality
restrictions, the Company and Parent shall have the right to review and
approve in advance, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, all the
information relating to it and its Subsidiaries that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent may, as each deems
reasonably advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
information provided to the other under this Section 6.5 as "outside counsel
only." Such information shall be given only to outside counsel of
the recipient. In addition, the Company and Parent may redact any information
from such documents shared with the other party or its counsel that is not
pertinent to the subject matter of the filing or submission or which is
subject to applicable confidentiality agreements and other confidentiality
restrictions.



(b) Subject to the proviso contained in the following sentence of this Section
6.5(b), the Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use, Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
obtain any non-governmental third-party consents, (i) necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii)
required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, or (iii) required to prevent a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring
prior to or after the Effective Time. In the event that either party shall
fail to obtain any third-party consent described in the  



 

41  first sentence of this Section 6.5(b), such party shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by
the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and
Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses
resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after the Effective
Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.



(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance

Section 6.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other party of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of
any event that would be reasonably likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to
this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition
to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to
comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice. Each of the Company and Parent shall provide to the other party the
written copy of the opinion of the Company Financial Advisors contemplated by
Section 3.3(c) and of the Parent Financial Advisor contemplated by Section
4.3(c), respectively, immediately following the receipt thereof from the
Company Financial Advisors and the Parent Financial Advisor, respectively.



Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company shall, to
the extent reasonably practicable, consult with and obtain the approval of the
other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before
issuing any press release or other public disclosure with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
disclosure prior to such consultation and approval, except as may be required
by applicable Law or any listing agreement related to the trading of the
shares of either party on any national securities exchange or national
automated quotation system, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public disclosure shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such
press release or making any such public disclosure; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response
to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending

disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and do
not reveal non-public information regarding the other party.



Section 6.8  _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and to be

(a) For one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to those employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries who were employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time, salary and employee welfare benefits
that, in the aggregate, are comparable to the salary and employee welfare
benefits package provided to such employees by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided Surviving Corporation Severance Benefits to
those employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries who
were employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time whose employment is involuntarily terminated within the
first (1st) year  



 

42  following the Effective Time. "Surviving Corporation Severance Benefits"

(b) With respect to each benefit plan of Parent (" _Parent Benefit Plan_ ")
in which employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _New Parent
Employees_ ") subsequently participate, for purposes of determining vesting
and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for purposes of accrual of pension benefits or equity
compensation), service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any Company Subsidiary
provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent;
_provided_ that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that
such service was not recognized under the applicable Company Benefit Plan.
Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations. Each Parent Benefit Plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable Company
Benefit Plan. New Parent Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid
under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

by the parties hereto shall be borne solely and entirely by the party which
has incurred the same; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and the

Section 9.5  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article of, a
Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not  



 

59  affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Unless otherwise expressly provided
herein, any agreement, instrument, statute or other Law defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein (unless
otherwise expressly provided therein) means such agreement, instrument,
statute or the Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein and
(in the case of statutes and other Laws) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and/or the adoption of rules regulations thereunder.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.



Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.



Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Parent and Company Disclosure Letters and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof.



Section 9.8  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except
that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company.



Section 9.9 _No Other Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
other than pursuant to Section 6.10, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.



Section 9.10 _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties.



Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.



(a) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes
between the parties under or related to the Agreement or the facts
and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in Contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of New York, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed
entirely within the State by residents of such State except for those
provisions which are expressly stated to be governed by the PBCL, which
provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Pennsylvania.



(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any court of the State of New York and Federal court of the
United States of  



 

60  America, in each case sitting in New York County, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court
or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such New York State or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such New York State or
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.



 

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.



Section 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof in addition to any other remedies at Law or in equity.



Section 9.14 _Disclosure_. Any matter disclosed in any section of a partys
Disclosure Letter shall be considered disclosed for other sections of such
Disclosure Letter, but only to the extent such matter on its face would
reasonably be expected to be pertinent to a particular section of a partys
Disclosure Letter in light of the disclosure made in such section. The
provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds for disclosure does not
and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of materiality
hereunder.



Section 9.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



 

61 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
