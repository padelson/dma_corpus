conditions set forth in the Termination Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE 1 ** 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall be effected pursuant to the DGCL and shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement are
referred to herein as the " _Transactions_ ".

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety in
the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ hereto, and as so amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action such
that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended so as
to read in their entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit C_ hereto, and as
so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other person, the directors of Merger
Sub

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals designated
by Parent as of the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective Time, in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Law. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time,
shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

 



 

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable conditions set forth
in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, John
Hancock Tower, 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur
of (a) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than
three (3) Business Days notice to the Company and (b) the first Business Day
following the end of the Marketing Period (subject, in each case, to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ for the
Closing as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso). The date on which
the Closing is to occur pursuant to this _Section 1.2_ is referred to as the
" _Closing Date_ ". On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and
the Company may agree to, Merger Sub or the Company shall cause a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later date and

 



      
 

 



 

time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (such date and time referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE 2 ** 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or converted
pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ or _2.4(b)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted automatically only into the right to receive $40.50 per Share (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without
interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, upon
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section
2.2_. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share held
by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub, in
each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. Each Share held by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other
than Merger Sub), in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation so as to maintain the same relative ownership
percentages (such Shares in this clause (b), " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. All outstanding Equity Interests of Merger
Sub held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become (in the aggregate) one share of newly and validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and
terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of Shares (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be
entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1_. In the event such
deposited funds are insufficient to make the payments contemplated pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ (other than in respect of Cancelled Shares or Dissenting

 



      
 

 



 

Shares), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has
sufficient funds to make such payments. With respect to any Dissenting Shares,
Parent shall only be required to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in exchange for
any Dissenting Shares, at or prior to the Effective Time, if the holder
thereof fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall, after the Effective Time, promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration in exchange for any Dissenting Shares to the extent the holder
thereof waives, withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL after the Effective Time. Such funds shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by the
Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares (other than Cancelled Shares or
Dissenting Shares) in accordance with this _Section 2.2_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or
guaranteed by, the United States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, an aggregate amount of $50 million of the aggregate Merger
Consideration that would otherwise be paid to the holders of the Subject
Shares (as defined in the Voting Agreement) in accordance with _Section
2.2(b)_ shall not be deposited with the Paying Agent and shall be distributed
without interest in accordance with the terms set forth on Schedule I hereto.
Parent hereby covenants and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to make
the distributions referenced in the immediately preceding sentence in
accordance with the terms set forth on Schedule I hereto.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Shares were
automatically converted only into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as
Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper
form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and any Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered
as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates
representing Shares to be cancelled or converted pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b),
2.1(c)_ or _2.4(b)_ and Certificates representing Shares that are Dissenting
Shares, which Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the
extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL so long as the holder of such
Dissenting Shares does not withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of
such Dissenting Shares or otherwise lose appraisal rights, in each case in
accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate or,
in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were
converted automatically only into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The
Depositary Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and
such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall be cancelled. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The
Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such
form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B)
instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares shall at the Effective
Time be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry
Shares representing Shares to be cancelled or converted pursuant to _Sections
2.1(b), 2.1(c)_ or _2.4(b)_ and Book-Entry Shares representing Shares that
are Dissenting Shares, which Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to represent
the right to receive payment of the

 



      
 

 



 

fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL so long as the holder of such Dissenting Shares does
not withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares or
otherwise lose appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof
designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, in respect of such holders surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates
will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Parent
may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Shares
outstanding immediately prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has
properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only
be entitled to the rights granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL. If
the Merger is completed and any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and as set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares and any other instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair
value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed
to in writing between a holder and the Parent, each option to purchase Shares
(each a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and be cancelled and
shall only entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of
Shares subject to the Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company
Option, less Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment under
applicable Law; provided that any such Company Option with respect to which
the per-share exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be canceled in exchange for no consideration. The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay to the holders of Company Options the cash payments described in this
_Section 2.4(a)_ as soon as practicable, but not later than five Business
Days following the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, except as
otherwise agreed to in writing between a holder and the Parent, each Share
granted under the Company Equity Plan as restricted stock (each, a " _Company
Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, (i) if subject solely to time based vesting conditions,
vest and entitle the holder of such Company Restricted Share to receive the
consideration payable with respect to such Share in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_, and (ii) if subject to performance-based vesting conditions (a "
_Company Performance Award_ ") vest as to the Target Number Restricted Shares
(within the meaning of the agreement governing the applicable Company
Performance Award), and entitle the holder thereof to receive, in respect of
each vested share subject to the Company Performance Award, the

 



      
 

 



 

consideration payable with respect to such Share in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt any Shares subject to a Company
Performance Award that do not vest pursuant to the foregoing shall, at the
Effective Time, be cancelled and forfeited without any payment thereon. The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay to the holders of Company Restricted Shares the cash payments
described in this _Section 2.4(b)_ as soon as practicable, but not later than
five Business Days following the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the Press
Ganey Holdings, Inc. 2015 Incentive Award Plan (the " _Company Equity Plan_ ")
shall be terminated (other than with respect to the payments required to be
made under this _Section 2.4_) and no further Company Restricted Shares,
Company Options, Equity Interests or other rights with respect to Shares shall
be granted thereunder.

 



 

(d) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take such other actions as are reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
described in this _Section 2.4_.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any other provision of applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

2.6 _Repayment of Funded Debt_. (a) At the Closing, and subject to the other
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i) Parent shall make
available to the Company, or pay directly, an amount in cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate outstanding Funded Debt and (ii) the Company, if such amount is
not paid directly by Parent, shall apply such cash to repay the Funded Debt,
and (b) at least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company shall
cause the applicable agent under the Credit Agreement to deliver to Parent a
copy of a payoff letter (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") evidencing the satisfaction
of all liabilities under the Credit Agreement (other than any Continuing
Obligations) upon receipt of the amounts set forth in such Payoff Letter and
including a release in customary form of all Liens with respect to the capital
stock, property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing the
obligations under the Credit Agreement.

and warranties in this _Article 3_ to which the information in such schedule
relates; _provided_ , that, disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule as
to a specific representation or warranty shall qualify any other sections of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure relates to such
other sections), and (b) as otherwise disclosed or identified in the Company
SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (other than any forward-looking

referenced therein to the extent they are similarly predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

authority to own or lease all of its properties, rights and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties, rights and assets owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
(the " _Company Charter_ ") and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Company
Bylaws_ ") of the Company, as most recently filed with the Company SEC
Documents prior to the date of this Agreement, are true, complete and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The

complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company and the authorized,
issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each such Subsidiary. None of the

record, by the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries free

obligations of any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company. No Subsidiary of
the Company owns any Shares or other Equity Interests in the Company. Prior to

complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
other similar organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, each

3.3 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance and compliance by the Company with each of its
obligations herein, and the consummation by it of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company, subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and no other
stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions. The Company has duly and
validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,

principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any
Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought.

restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and
any other similar Law are not applicable to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the
Merger or the other Transactions. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other
takeover, anti-takeover, business combination, control share acquisition or
similar Law applies to the Merger or the other Transactions. The only vote of
holders of any class or series of Shares or other Equity Interests of the
Company necessary to adopt this Agreement is the affirmative vote for the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the Shares
outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company Meeting (the "
_Company Stockholder Approval_ "). No other vote of the holders of Shares or
any other Equity Interests of the Company is necessary to consummate the
Transactions.

 



 

3.4 _No Conflicts_.

the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company will not, (i) assuming the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or the Company
Bylaws or any equivalent organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
permits described in _Section 3.4(b)_ have been obtained and all filings and

Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or
affected or (iii) except as set forth in _Section 3.4_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, require any consent or approval under, result in any
breach of or any loss of any benefit under, constitute a change of control or
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
Contract (other than any Credit Document) or Permit to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is party, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not and
will not, and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions and
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) under the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (ii) any applicable requirements of
any Competition Laws, (iii) the filing and recordation of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL (together with any applicable franchise tax
reports) and (iv) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.5 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements, registration statements, prospectuses and other documents required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act since May 20, 2015 (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). None
of the Subsidiaries of the Company is required to make any filings with the
SEC.

 



 

(b) As of its respective filing date, and, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing, as of the date of the last amendment or superseding filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, each Company SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not received
any SEC comments that remain outstanding or

 



      
 

 



 

unresolved. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement,
none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
outstanding SEC comment.

 



 

(c) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules
thereto) (the " _Company SEC Financial Statements_ ") fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial condition and the consolidated
results of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) as of the respective
dates of and for the periods referred to in the Company SEC Financial
Statements, and were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of any interim unaudited Company SEC Financial
Statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q).

 



 

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K
or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on
the Companys managements most recently completed evaluation of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting, (i) the Company had no "significant
deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (each as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) the Company does not have Knowledge of any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any material liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued) required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or the notes thereto) except (i) as
disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the most recent audited balance
sheet included in the Company SEC Financial Statements or the notes thereto,
(ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since the date of the most recent
audited balance sheet included in the Company SEC Financial Statements, (iii)
for liabilities and obligations arising out of or in connection with this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions and (iv) for liabilities and
obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(f) _Section 3.5(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true,
correct and complete list of all indebtedness for borrowed money of the
Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of the date of this Agreement in
excess of $10 million.

 



 

3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2015 through
the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses in all material respects only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice and (b) there has not
been any Effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since June
30, 2016 through the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would have constituted a breach of,
or required Parents consent pursuant to, _Sections 5.1(b)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ ,
_(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ , _(o)_ or _(p)_ had the covenants therein applied
since June 30, 2016.

 



 

3.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date that the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is mailed to holders of Shares or at the time of the
Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading (except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company to such portions thereof
that relate to Parent and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or to
statements made therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of

ARTICLE 4 ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub to the Company (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") prior to the
execution of this Agreement (with specific reference to the representations
and warranties in this _Article 4_ to which the information in such schedule
relates; _provided_ , that, disclosure in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as to
a specific representation or warranty shall qualify any other sections of this
Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure relates to such
other sections), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation
or other entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent
applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate or other entity power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties, rights and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties, rights and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.2 _Authority, Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions applicable to such party. The
execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, the
performance and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with each of its
obligations herein and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions applicable to it have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub and no stockholder
votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation by Parent
and Merger Sub of the Transactions to which it is a party. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes Parents and Merger Subs legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the
discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking
enforcement may be brought.

 



 

4.3 _No Conflicts_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub,
does not and will not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger by Parent and Merger Sub will not, (i) conflict
with or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
similar organizational documents of

 



      
 

 



 

Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and permits described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have been obtained
and all filings and notifications described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have been
made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict
with or violate any Law applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent (each a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and, collectively, the "
_Parent Subsidiaries_ "), or by which any property or asset of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is bound or affected or (iii) require any consent or
approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under,
constitute a change of control or default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, including Merger Sub, pursuant to, any Contract or Permit
to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party, except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
in _Section 3.4_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub does not and will not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Transactions and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with any of
the terms or provisions hereof will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except (i) under the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the NYSE, (ii) under any applicable requirements of any
Competition Laws, (iii) the filing and recordation of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL (together with any applicable franchise tax
reports) and (iv) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.4 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding Order that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or that challenges the validity or propriety of the
Merger.

 



 

4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy
of the fully executed Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter
(collectively, the " _Commitment Letters_ " and each a " _Commitment Letter_
"). Neither of the Commitment Letters has been amended or modified in any
manner prior to or as of the date of this Agreement, nor is any such amendment
or modification contemplated except as permitted by _Section 5.10(a)(i)_.
Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any agreement, side
letter or other understanding or arrangement relating to the Debt Financing,
other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The proceeds of the
Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all
"market flex" provisions related thereto), if funded, together with cash on
hand at the Company, will be sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the payment of the Closing Payments on the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in
the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn,

 



      
 

 



 

terminated or rescinded in any respect. The Commitment Letters are in full
force and effect and represent a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, to provide
the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters as of the date hereof
and except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally, by general equitable principles or by the discretion of any
Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking enforcement thereof
may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity). Parent has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and
all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing and will pay (or
cause to be paid) in full any such amounts due and payable on or before the
Effective Time. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Commitment Letters. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it or any other party
thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Commitment
Letters or will not or will not be able to perform its obligations thereunder.
The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the Debt Financing on the Closing Date that will be included in the Debt
Financing Documents shall be the conditions set forth in Section 6 of the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Assuming satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ _,_ Parent has no reason to
believe that (i) any of the conditions to the Commitment Letters will not be
satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the
Closing Date. Each of Parent and Merger Sub understands and acknowledges that
under the terms of this Agreement, Parents and Merger Subs obligation to
consummate the Merger is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject
to Parents or Merger Subs consummation of any financing arrangements,
Parents obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or
extension of any financing to Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

4.6 _Termination Equity Commitment Letter_. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, the Equity Investors have delivered to the Company the
Termination Equity Commitment Letter dated as of the date hereof. The
Termination Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a
valid and binding obligation of the Equity Investors, enforceable against the
Equity Investors in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any
Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Equity Investors under the Termination
Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

4.7 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date that the Proxy Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto is mailed to holders of Shares and at the
time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading (except that
no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub to such portions
thereof that relate expressly to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to
statements made therein based on

 



      
 

 



 

information supplied by or on behalf of Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein).

 



 

4.8 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Subsidiary beneficially owns any Shares. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
is, nor at any time during the last three years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than
as contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

4.9 _Solvency_. Assuming (w) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ , (x) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all respects, (y)
any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that have been made available to Parent have been prepared in good faith based
upon assumptions that were, at the time made, and continue to be, at the
Effective Time, reasonable and (z) immediately prior to the Effective Time the
Company is solvent, after giving effect to the consummation of the Merger and
the consummation of the Financing, the Surviving Corporation will not (i) be
insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its
liabilities is greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the
fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its
liabilities as they come due), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which
to engage in its business or fail to satisfy any capital adequacy requirements
under Law or (iii) have incurred obligations beyond its ability to pay them as
they become due.

 



 

4.10 _Ownership of Parent and Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding Equity
Interests of Parent and Merger Sub have been duly authorized and validly
issued. All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of Merger Sub are,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or indirectly by Parent, and
all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of Parent are, and at the
Effective Time will be, owned directly or indirectly by the Equity Investors
or their affiliates. Merger Sub was formed solely for purposes of the Merger
and, except for matters incident to formation and execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the performance of the transactions contemplated hereby,
Merger Sub has not prior to the date hereof engaged in any business or other
activities.

 



 

4.11 _Brokers_. Except for the financial advisors fees set forth in _Section
4.11_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors on behalf of
Parent or such Parent Subsidiary has employed any financial advisor, broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory, brokers fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with any of the Transactions.

 



 

4.12 _No Other Representations and Warranties; Non-Reliance_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the
business, operations, assets, Intellectual Property, technology, liabilities,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and
each of them acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received access
to such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets
of the Company that it and its Representatives have requested to review, and
that it and its Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the
management of the Company and to discuss the business and assets of the
Company. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company
nor any Person on behalf of the Company makes,

 



      
 

 



 

and none of Parent or Merger Sub has relied upon, any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided to Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
including the accuracy or completeness thereof other than the representations
and warranties contained in _Article 3_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective affiliates,
stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives shall not have any
liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent
Subsidiary, or their respective affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons
or Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal
or state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information (including
any statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and
any financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-
looking information) provided or made available (including in any data rooms,
management presentations, information or descriptive memorandum or
supplemental information), or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to
Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiary, or any of their respective
affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives, except as
and only to the extent expressly set forth in _Article 3_ (as qualified by
the Company Disclosure Schedule).

or any non-public information to, any Third Party (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Representatives) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
(D) execute or enter into, any merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
transaction agreement, letter of intent or other similar agreement for any
Acquisition Proposal, (E) knowingly take any action to make the provision of
any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business combination" or other
similar anti-takeover Law inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal or (F) authorize any of, or commit or agree to do any of,
the foregoing. Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from and
after the Solicitation Period End Date until the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) withdraw, change
or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, (iii) approve or cause the Company to enter into any merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, transaction agreement, letter of intent or
other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or (iv) resolve or agree to do any of
the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iv)
of this sentence (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii)
of this sentence), a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ "). No later than two
(2) Business Days following the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company
shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Exempted Person,
together with (x) an unredacted copy of the most recent Acquisition Proposal
made by such Exempted Person, if in writing, incorporating any material
modifications thereto or (y) a written summary of the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, if oral, incorporating any material modifications
thereto.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_,
if at any time following the Solicitation Period End Date and prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) the Company
has not breached this _Section 5.3_ in any material respect with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
(iv) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to undertake the actions in clauses (A) and (B) would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal, its Representatives and potential sources of financing pursuant to
(but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making
such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
however, that any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously
provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub, be provided to Parent or
Merger Sub substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to a Third
Party.

 



 

(d) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing in the
event that the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry that
could reasonably be expected to

 



      
 

 



 

lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) of the identity of such Person and provide to
Parent a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including draft
agreements or term sheets, financing commitments and other related documents
submitted in connection therewith or, where no such copy is available, a
reasonable written summary of the material terms, in each case, with any
material modifications thereto. In addition, from and after the Solicitation
Period End Date, the Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) provide Parent promptly
after the receipt or delivery of all correspondence and other written material
sent or provided to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives from
any Person that describes any changes to the terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Companys
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person that prohibits
the Company from providing such information or any other information
contemplated by this _Section 5.3_ to Parent or otherwise limits or impairs
the Companys, its affiliates or its Representatives ability to comply with
their respective obligations in this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_,
if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which did
not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.3_ and that the Company
Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that (x)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure
to take such action would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior
to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, subject to complying with
_Section 5.3(g)_, (i) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to
such Superior Proposal or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(f)_ to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, in either case subject to the requirements of this _Section
5.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that as a condition precedent to terminating
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_, the Company pays to Parent the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3._

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_,
the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) may at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, subject to
materially complying with _Section 5.3(g)_, effect a Change of Board
Recommendation if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
has determined in good faith, (i) after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisors, that an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing and (ii) after consultation with its outside counsel, that the
failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make a Change of Board Recommendation and the Company
will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
7.1(f)_ unless (i) the Company has complied

 



      
 

 



 

in all material respects with this _Section 5.3_, (ii) the Company promptly
notifies Parent, in writing, at least four (4) Business Days before the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the Company takes
such action, of its intention to take such action (which notification shall
specify, to the extent an Intervening Event is the basis for the Change of
Board Recommendation, the details of such event, and to the extent a Superior
Proposal is the basis for the Change of Board Recommendation, the identity of
the person making an Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a
Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof, together with copies of any
written offer or proposal, proposed definitive agreement, proposed or
committed financing documentation and any other material related documents in
respect of such Acquisition Proposal), (iii) during such four (4) Business Day
period, if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall be
available to meet and engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a
manner so that, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal or, with respect to an
Intervening Event, would permit the Company Board (or any duly authorized
committee thereof) to not take such actions, and (iv) following the end of
such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (or any duly authorized
committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, and taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent following any notice provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(g)_ or otherwise, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and, in the case of a Change of Board
Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal or termination under
_Section 7.1(f)_, after consultation with its financial advisors, that the
Acquisition Proposal giving rise to such notice continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms or conditions (including the provision
of financing) of the Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute a
Superior Proposal or (y) any material change in respect of such Intervening
Event, in each case, shall require a new written notification from the Company
and an additional two (2) Business Day period that (other than as to the four
(4) Business Day time periods set forth herein) satisfies this _Section
5.3(g)_.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) disclosing
to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a),
Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as set forth in the following
sentence, if such disclosure does not reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Board
Recommendation or (ii) the accurate disclosure of factual information
regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company, which such disclosure shall comply with this _Section 5.3_. The
issuance by the Company or the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal from a Third Party
concerning (A) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization,

 



      
 

 



 

reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, extraordinary dividend or
distribution, repurchase or redemption of Shares, share exchange or other
business combination transaction involving the Company, (B) a direct or
indirect acquisition, purchase, sale, lease or other disposition, in one
transaction or a series of related transaction, of assets of the Company
(including Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the Company) or its
Subsidiaries or businesses representing 15% or more of the consolidated
assets, net income or consolidated revenues of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or more than 15% of any class of Equity
Interests of the Company, (C) an issuance (including by way of merger,
consolidation, business combination or share exchange) of Equity Interests
representing 15% or more of the voting power of the Company, or (D) any
combination of the foregoing (in each case, other the Merger).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%") that the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
taking into account such factors (including but not limited to all financial,
legal, timing, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal or offer
(including any break-up fee, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to
consummation and financing terms) and the person making such proposal) as the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) considers in good
faith to be appropriate, is more favorable from a financial point of view to
the Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement
agreed to in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination).

 



 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change, effect, development,
state of facts, condition or occurrence (including any acceleration or
deceleration of existing changes or developments) that is material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries that (A) was not known (or, if known, the
consequences of which were not reasonably foreseeable) to the Company Board as
of or prior to the date of this Agreement, and (B) does not involve or relate
to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(iv) " _Exempted Person_ " means any Person or group of Persons (so long as,
in the case of a group of Persons, the members of such group who were members
of such group immediately prior to the Solicitation Period End Date constitute
more than 50% of the equity financing of such group of Persons at all times
following the Solicitation Period End Date), from whom the Company or any of
its Representatives has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to the Solicitation Period End Date
that, on or before the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company Board (or any
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which
Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and has not expired or been
terminated as of the Solicitation Period End Date.

 



 

5.4 _SEC Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, but no later than within 20 Business Days, the Company shall
prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, which shall, subject to
_Section 5.3_, include the Company Board

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation. Parent and Merger Sub, and their counsel, shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall
consider in good faith and include any reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel. The
Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to respond to and resolve as
promptly as practicable any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) and to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as of the record
date established for the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, and in no event more than five (5) Business Days after
the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to mail the definitive Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders
prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days after the Solicitation Period
End Date. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall provide them a summary of any oral comments, that
the Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) as promptly as
practicable after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any such responses and the Company shall consider in good faith the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and its
counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information that is
customarily included in a proxy statement prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement concerning themselves
and their affiliates as promptly as practicable after the date hereof. If at
any time prior to the Company Meeting any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, is discovered by a party
hereto, which information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that either the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party and the Company shall prepare (with the
assistance of Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement, in each case, to the extent required by applicable Law. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (i) correct any
information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy Statement,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected or supplemented
promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Company Charter,
the Company Bylaws and the applicable requirements of the NYSE to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders promptly
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "), with the record date
and meeting date of the Company Meeting to be selected after reasonable
consultation with Parent, and (ii) subject to a Change of Board Recommendation
in accordance with _Section 5.3_, shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy

 



      
 

 



 

Statement and use all reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company may postpone
or adjourn the Company Meeting from time to time (A) with the consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), (B) if a quorum has not been established at the time of the
originally scheduled Company Meeting, (C) after consultation with Parent, with
respect to any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial
advisors is necessary under applicable Law, to the extent necessary to (1)
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of such
supplemental or amended disclosure, and (2) ensure such supplemental or
amended disclosure is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Meeting, (D) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies if necessary in order
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or (E) if required by Law. Unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article 7_, if the Company
Board shall have made a Change of Board Recommendation, the Company shall
nonetheless submit this Agreement to the stockholders at the Company Meeting
and shall not submit an alternate Acquisition Proposal for adoption by
stockholders of the Company.

 



 

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from, or
participation in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties,
including under any Contract to which the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is party or by which such Person or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, (ii) obtain all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations
from Governmental Entities (including, without limitation, those in connection
with applicable Competition Laws), make all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity (including, without limitation, in connection with applicable
Competition Laws), (iii) resist, contest or defend any Proceeding (including
administrative or judicial Proceedings) challenging the Merger or the
completion of the Transactions, including seeking to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that could
restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the Transactions, and (iv)
execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions and fully to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Each of
the parties shall furnish to each other party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, the Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other in connection
with, all of the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the Transactions. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act

 



       
 

 



 

reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep
each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other written substantive communications received by the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with respect to
such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances,
shall provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective affiliates to, make or cause to be made all filings required under
applicable Competition Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and, in any event, file all required HSR Act notifications within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting this _Section 5.5_, Parent agrees to use its best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause
to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to resolve, avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later
than the Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to,
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses
of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (ii)
accepting any operational restrictions or otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets, properties,
licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in each case, as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other Order in
any suit or Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
delaying the Closing, as applicable. If such efforts fail to resolve, avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to
enable the Closing to occur, then Parent shall, at the written request of the
Company, use its reasonable best efforts to avoid, resist, resolve, or, if
necessary, defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court
by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
Closing from occurring as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later
than the Outside Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer, license,
separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition
of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective
control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other modification of
rights in respect of, any assets, properties or businesses of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, in each case, is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.5_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall require Parent to take or agree to take any action
with respect to any of its affiliates or any direct or indirect portfolio
companies of investment funds advised or managed by one or more affiliates of
Parent (in each case, other

 



      
 

 



 

than the Company and its Subsidiaries), including selling, divesting,
conveying, holding separate, or otherwise limiting its freedom of action with
respect to any assets, rights, products, licenses, businesses, operations, or
interest therein, of any such affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or any direct or indirect portfolio companies of investment
funds advised or managed by one or more affiliates of Parent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.5_, Parent shall have
the right to determine and direct the strategy and process by which the
parties shall seek required consents, approvals, clearances, waivers, waiting
period expirations and terminations and removal of all impediments (including
all elements of any proceeding or litigation and communications with any
Governmental Entity).

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business
operations.

 



 

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occur:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or the NYSE (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such party
becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article 6_ not being satisfied. Any such notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_ shall not affect any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement and any failure to make such notice (in
and of itself) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or give rise to any
right of termination set forth in _Article 7_.

 



 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not issue
any press release or make any public statement with respect to the Merger or
this Agreement, including any broad-based employee communications, without the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance, (b) any public statement in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences and/or disclosures
in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other party), or (c) with
respect to any press release or other public statement by the Company
permitted by _Section 5.3_. The press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and shall not be
issued prior to the approval of each of, the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and Parent. The Company shall file a current report on Form 8-K with
the SEC attaching its press release and copy of this Agreement as exhibits.

 



 

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for the period ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Covered Period_ "), Parent shall (i)
provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
to provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each a " _Continuing Employee_ ") who continues
employment with Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries base compensation,
target annual cash bonus opportunity and severance or termination benefits
that are not less favorable than the base compensation, target annual cash
bonus opportunity and severance or termination benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide
or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
provide benefits (excluding equity award compensation or any transaction-based
payments) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, have a value
that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including any vacation,
paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals,
each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be treated as service with Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation to the same extent such service was
recognized under a comparable Company Benefit Plan as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits and the foregoing service credit shall not apply with respect to
any defined benefit plan.

 



 

(c) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Parent shall, or shall cause
the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or
cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.10_, the provisions of this
_Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall create such rights in
any such individuals. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates from terminating the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii)
require the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plans, programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof; or (iii) amend any Company Benefit Plans or other
employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

 



 

5.9 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall advance expenses
as incurred to, to the fullest extent permitted under (i) the Company Charter,
the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of the date
of this Agreement and (ii) any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and
officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
employees who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively,
the " _Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who
serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan as provided in its
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of no less than six years from the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the applicable partys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of the
date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding
pending or asserted

 



      
 

 



 

or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit of the current and former
directors and officers of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing Date, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing Date (the " _D andO
Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of the Company, or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement, which is set forth in _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if Parent or the Company (with Parents
written consent) purchases a prepaid "tail" policy prior to the Effective
Time, which policy provides such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of
this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(a) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to
be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification, expense advancement or contribution
that any such individual may have under the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this
Agreement or in any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as
of the date of this Agreement. The obligations of Parent under this _Section
5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies unless
(x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.9_).

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

 



      
 

 



 

5.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement (but taking into account the Marketing
Period) and to consummate the Financing on the Closing Date, including using
reasonable best efforts with respect to the following:

 



 

(i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters and not permitting any
amendment or modification to be made to, not consenting to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, and not replacing, the Commitment Letters, if such
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement: (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid
in respect of the Debt Financing or original issue discount in respect of the
Debt Financing), (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, (C) prevents or materially delays the Closing, (D) makes the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) less likely to occur or (E) adversely impacts the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights against other parties to the applicable Commitment
Letter ( _provided_ , that (x) Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof
and (y) Parent shall disclose to the Company promptly its intention to amend,
modify, waive or replace the Debt Commitment Letter, shall keep the Company
reasonably apprised of the status and proposed terms and conditions thereof,
and shall promptly furnish to the Company copies of any agreements or other
documentation with respect to such amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement);

 



 

(ii) causing the Equity Financing to be consummated upon satisfaction of the
conditions contained in the Equity Commitment Letter;

 



 

(iii) satisfying (or seeking a waiver of) on a timely basis (taking into
account the timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions to the Debt
Financing and the Equity Financing that are within its control or subject to
its influence;

 



 

(iv) negotiating, executing and delivering the definitive Debt Financing
Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or on such other
terms acceptable to Parent and the Financing Sources (but such other terms to
be subject to the limitations on any amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement of a Commitment Letter as set forth in _Section 5.10(a)(i)_) and
providing copies thereof exchanged with the Financing Sources to the Company
upon any reasonable request;

 



 

(v) enforcing its rights under the Commitment Letters in the event of a
Financing Failure Event; and

 



 

(vi) timely prepare, with the assistance of the Company and the applicable
Financing Sources, the marketing materials with respect to the Debt Financing
(including with respect to timing, taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing

 



      
 

 



 

Period) and commence the syndication and/or marketing activities contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any material breach or
repudiation, or any such written threatened breach or repudiation, by any
party to the Commitment Letters of which Parent or its affiliates obtains
Knowledge and (ii) receipt of any written notice or other written
communication to Parent from any party to the Commitment Letters with respect
to any actual or threatened breach, default (or any accusation of breach or
default), termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent be under any obligation
to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege.

 



 

(c) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
related "market flex" terms) regardless of the reason therefor, including in
connection with a Financing Failure Event (but other than due to the failure
of a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing resulting from a
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company set forth in this Agreement and as a result of which alternative
financing sources are not otherwise then available), Parent shall, as promptly
as practicable, (i) notify the Company of such unavailability and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the reasons therefor, and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") on
terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any related "market flex" terms) in an
amount, when added to the portion of the Financing being replaced that is
still available, such that the aggregate funds available to Parent at Closing
will be sufficient to pay the Closing Payments and otherwise consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event and, when obtained, provide a copy of
such Alternative Debt Financing commitment. In the event that Parent obtains
Alternative Debt Financing pursuant to this _Section 5.10(c)_, references to
the "Debt Financing," the "Financing," the "Debt Commitment Letter" and the
"Commitment Letters" (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed
to be modified to refer to such Alternative Debt Financing.

 



 

5.11 _Debt Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to provide (or cause to be
provided, including by using reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to provide) on a timely basis (taking into account the timing
of the Marketing Period) such cooperation (including with respect to
timeliness) in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as is
reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , that the Company shall in no
event be required to provide (or cause to be provided) such assistance that
shall unreasonably interfere with its or its Subsidiaries business
operations. Such assistance shall include the following, each of which

 



      
 

 



 

shall be at Parents reasonable written request with reasonable prior notice
and at Parents sole cost and expense:

 



 

(i) participation by the senior management team of the Company in the
marketing activities undertaken in connection with the marketing of the Debt

similar to the Debt Financing, (B) participation in due diligence sessions,
(C) a reasonable number of meetings, presentations and other customary
syndication activities with the actual and prospective Financing Sources,

actual and prospective Financing Sources, on the other hand and (D) execution
and delivery of customary authorization letters contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided, that Parent will use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that such letters expressly state that the Company shall not have any
liability of any kind or nature in connection with their cooperation with
arranging the Debt Financing, except for liability under the applicable
definitive Debt Financing Documents executed on the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) participation by senior management of the Company and applicable
representatives in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency

Subsidiaries with respect to entering into such definitive Debt Financing
Documents and otherwise necessary to permit consummation of the Debt
Financing; and

 



 

(vi) delivering (or causing to be delivered) notices of prepayment (which
notice may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing and other
transactions contemplated hereunder (including the Financing)) within the time
periods required by the relevant agreements governing the Funded Debt and
obtaining the Payoff Letter at least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing;

 



 

provided that (w) nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall require any such
action to the extent it would (1) unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give any
indemnities, in any case prior to the Closing, for which Parent does not

 



      
 

 



 

promptly reimburse or indemnify it, as the case may be, under this Agreement
or (2) require the Company, any Company Related Party or their respective
representatives or financing sources to (I) execute, deliver or enter into, or
perform any agreement, document or instrument (except for the customary
authorization letter referred to in clause (i)(D) above), including any
commitment letter, with respect to any Financing prior to the Effective Time
that is not contingent upon the consummation of Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time, (II) commit to take any action
(including entry into an agreement) that is not contingent upon the
consummation of Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time
or (III) deliver any legal opinions or reliance letters in connection with the
Debt Financing, (x) none of the board or its directors (or other similarly
governing body) of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be required to adopt
resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to
which any Financing is obtained (except that the board of directors of
Subsidiaries may adopt such resolutions derived from and based on (1) the
authorizations (including appointment of directors and authorized officers)
provided by Parent in its capacity as the direct or indirect controlling
equity-holder of the Surviving Corporation and (2) resolutions adopted by the
Surviving Corporation, and solely to the extent such Subsidiary resolutions
are contingent upon the Closing or become effective after giving effect to the
Effective Time), (y) the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.11_
shall be subject to the Financing Sources and their affiliates and their
respective Representatives (as applicable) being bound by confidentiality
agreements in accordance with customary market practice; and (z) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide any
information pursuant to this clause (a) to the extent it would result in the
waiver of an attorney-client or similar privilege if the Company shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to provide such information in a way that
would not waive such privilege.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to provide the Company sufficient
time to review and comment on marketing materials used in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing prior to the dissemination of such materials
to potential lenders or other counterparties to any proposed financing
transaction (or filing with any Governmental Entity); provided, that the
Company shall communicate in writing their comments, if any, to Parent and its
counsel within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances and
consistent with the time accorded to other participants who were asked to
review and comment on such marketing materials.

 



 

(c) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other
Representatives, from and against any and all liabilities, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred in connection with the arranging or obtaining of the

therewith. Parent shall promptly, upon the request of the Company, reimburse
the Company for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third
party costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with this _Section 5.11_.

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Financing is not a
condition to Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is
understood and agreed that the condition precedent set forth in _Section
6.3(b)_, as applied to the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.11_,
shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the Financing has not

 



      
 

 



 

been obtained as a direct result of the Companys Willful and Material Breach
of its obligations under this _Section 5.11_.

 



 

(e) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Companys logos
in connection with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or the reputation or goodwill thereof or associated
therewith.

 



 

5.12 _Parent Agreements Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent hereby guarantees the
due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub of,
and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions
necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by
Merger Sub hereunder.

 



 

5.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business
combination" or other similar takeover Law) is, becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Merger, this Agreement,
the Voting Agreement or any other Transactions, then the Company and the
Company Board shall take all actions reasonably available to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions.

 



 

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the
Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

5.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction
Litigation (as defined below), consult with Parent with respect to the defense
or settlement of such litigation and consider in good faith Parents advice
with respect to such Transaction Litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly
notify Parent, and Parent shall promptly notify the Company if it becomes
aware, of any Proceeding commenced or threatened against the Company, Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates or directors relating
to, in connection with or arising from the Merger or any other Transaction ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "), and shall keep the other party reasonably and
promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 5.15_, any Proceeding relating to Dissenting
Shares shall be governed by _Section 2.3_.

 



 

5.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Companys securities to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act

 



       
 

 



 

as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and prior to the
Effective Time the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect
thereto.

the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective

hereof (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the

suffered as a result of a Willful and Material Breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to
such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations imposed by (i)

termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in

7.3 _Company Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_,
then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) prior to or
concurrently with such termination, in the case of a termination by the
Company, or within two (2) Business Days thereafter, in the case of a
termination by Parent, the Company Termination Fee. The " _Company Termination

(b) The parties hereto agree that if (i) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, (ii) an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced or an Acquisition Proposal has otherwise become known to
the Company after the date hereof and (A) in the event

twelve (12) months after such termination and the transaction contemplated by
such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay the
Company Termination Fee to Parent (or its designee), no later than two (2)
Business Days after the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. For
purposes of this _Section 7.3(b)_, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.3(i)(i)_, except that
the references to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

 



 

(e) In circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable in
accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_, Parents receipt of
the Company Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf of the Company
shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in
contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Laws or otherwise) against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
of their respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, general or limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or
assignees (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and
damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, for any breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
no such Person shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

7.4 _Parent Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that (i) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ (or _Section 7.1(d)_ in
circumstances in which the Company could terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_), then Parent shall pay to the Company,
as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within five (5)
Business Days) following such termination, $124,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) All payments under this _Section 7.4_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Company, or in the absence of such designation, an account established for the
sole benefit of the Company.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company
and the Company Related Parties for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and that without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent or
Merger Sub fails to effect the Closing by the date the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_ or otherwise breaches this Agreement
or fails to perform its obligations hereunder, then, (i) except for the right

Financing Sources, each of their respective affiliates or any of their
respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders,

7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ and following such
termination, receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to and

Parent or from the Equity Investors pursuant to the Termination Equity
Commitment Letter, and (ii) following termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_
and payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to and solely to the extent
required by _Section 7.4(a)_, except with respect to any obligations of the
Parent Related Parties under the Confidentiality Agreement, none of the Parent
Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the
Company Related Parties for any losses or damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be consummated, for any breach or failure to perform hereunder, or
otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by
the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether
by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited liability company
or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party or
another Person or otherwise).

_Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ and, pursuant to

pays the Parent Termination Fee, then the Company agrees to cause any
Proceeding pending in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any Proceeding related to the
Financing or the Termination Equity Commitment Letter, but except for any
Proceeding with respect to the first sentence of _Section 5.2(b)_) by the
Company or any of its affiliates, and to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause any such Proceeding by any other Company Related Party against Parent or
any other Parent Related Party, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and
in any event within three (3) Business Days, after payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to and solely to the extent required by _Section
7.4(a)_. In no event shall the Company or any other Company Related Party seek
any monetary damages from, or otherwise bring any Proceeding against, Parent
or any other Parent Related Party in connection with this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including any Proceeding related to the
Financing or the Termination Equity Commitment Letter), other than a
Proceeding (i) to recover payment of the Parent Termination Fee payable
pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_, (ii) for an injunction or specific performance
in accordance with _Section 8.14_, or (iii) with respect to the first

Proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or

other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State
court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware,

such Proceeding in any such court. Each of the parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT

INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH

 



      
 

 



 

OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to _Section
8.12(e)_ below, each party agrees (i) that any action of any kind or nature,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, against a
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought exclusively in
any New York state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and
each party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address
provided in _Section 8.3_ shall be effective service of process against it
for any such action brought in any such court, (iii) to waive and hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any
such court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law, (v) that the Laws of the State of New

waives any right to a trial by jury in any such action to the same extent such
rights are waived pursuant to _Section 8.12(c)_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (and any of
its stockholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Financing Parties and any of their affiliates and any of such
entities or their affiliates respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents, in connection with this Agreement or the
Debt Financing Commitments, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise; _provided_ that the foregoing waiver and release shall not apply to
any rights, claims or causes of action that the Company or any of its
affiliates or other equityholders may have against any Financing Party (a) in
its capacity as agent, lender, swingline lender or issuing bank under the
Credit Agreement, or (b) for breach of any nondisclosure agreement that any
Financing Party may have entered into with the Company or its affiliates.

 



 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

(in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by
facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

 



 

8.14 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 8.14(b)_ and in this _Section
8.14(a)_, prior to termination of this Agreement, (i) the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, (ii) the
parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief
and (iii) the parties will waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. The Companys or Parents pursuit of
specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or
waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party
may be entitled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company
or any of the other Company Related Parties have the right to seek or obtain
money damages or expense reimbursement (whether based in contract, tort or
strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws
or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited liability company or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of a party or another Person or otherwise) from Parent, Merger Sub or
any of the other Parent Related Parties other than the right of the Company to
seek payment of the Parent Termination Fee solely to the extent payable
pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement and the Termination Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section 8.14(a)_, it is
explicitly agreed that, prior to termination of this Agreement, the Company
shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Parents obligations to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter in order to fund the transactions contemplated hereby
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
by demanding Parent to fully enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter
against the investment funds party thereto and Parents rights thereunder,
solely if, following the Marketing Period, (i) all of the conditions set forth
in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ have been satisfied or waived at the time the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_ (other than
those conditions to Closing that by their terms or their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied
assuming a Closing would occur), (ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by
the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_,
(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or the Financing Sources have
confirmed in writing to Parent or the Company that the Debt Financing will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and
(iv) the Company has delivered an irrevocable written notice to Parent stating
that, if Parent performs its obligations hereunder and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 8.14_ to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and payment of the Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Termination Fee; _provided_ , that, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
provisions set forth in _Section 7.4_ shall not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect the Companys right to seek specific
performance prior to the termination of the Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically the Parents right to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the Merger if the
Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

satisfactory to Parent; _provided further_ , that such Stockholder shall
remain liable for any failure by such affiliate to so perform under this

_Section 2_ shall be void ab initio and of no force or effect.

capacity as a stockholder of the Company) that it shall, or shall cause its
nominee holder of record on any applicable record date to, vote the Subject

special meeting of the stockholders of the Company or deliver a written
consent in respect of such Stockholders Subject Shares:

 



 

(a) in favor of (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
Merger, (ii) each of the actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in
respect of which approval of the Companys stockholders is requested, and
(iii) any proposal or action in respect of which approval of the Companys
stockholders is requested that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and

 



 

(b) against (i) any proposal or action that would constitute a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholders under this
Agreement or that reasonably would be expected to prevent, impede, frustrate,
interfere with, materially delay or adversely affect the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) any Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any stock
purchase agreement or other agreement relating to a merger, consolidation,
combination, sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, reorganization, recapitalization,

Subsidiaries (other than the Merger Agreement) and (iv) any change in the
present capitalization or dividend policy of the Company or any amendment or
other change to the Company Charter or Bylaws;

 



 

 _provided_ that the foregoing voting covenants shall apply solely to actions
taken by each Stockholder in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, and
solely with respect to such matters to the extent the approval of the
Companys stockholders is required or requested of the Companys stockholders,
and no Stockholder shall have any obligations or restrictions with respect to
such matters in any other capacity or in any other context; _provided further_
, that except as expressly set forth in _Section 3(a)_ and _Section 3(b)_,
each Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting (or abstaining from
voting) or acting by written consent with respect to any other matter
presented to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

Prior to the Expiration Date, each Stockholder covenants it shall not enter
into any understanding or agreement with any Person to vote or give
instructions with respect to such Stockholders Subject Shares, shall not
grant a proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to such Stockholders
Subject Shares and shall not take any action that would make any
representation or warranty of such Stockholder contained in this Agreement
untrue or incorrect

 



      
 

 



 

or preventing or disabling such Stockholder from performing any of its
obligations under this Agreement, in each case, in any manner inconsistent
with _Section 3(a)_ or _Section 3(b)_.

 



 

Until the Expiration Date, in the event that any meeting of the stockholders
of the Company is held with respect to any of the matters specified in
_Section 3(a)_ above (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), each
Stockholder covenants that it shall, or shall cause the holder of record of
such Stockholders Subject Shares on each record date relevant to such a
stockholder vote with respect to such specified matters to, appear at such
meeting or otherwise cause such Stockholders Subject Shares that are eligible
to be voted at such stockholder meeting to be counted as present thereat for
purposes of establishing a quorum.

 



 

Each Stockholder agrees that the obligations of such Stockholder specified in
this Section 3 shall not be affected by any Change of Board Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , in the event of a Change of Board Recommendation with
respect to an Intervening Event made in compliance with the Merger Agreement,
solely in connection with a vote that is subject to Section 3(a), the
obligation of each Stockholder to vote its Subject Shares in the manner set
forth in Section 3(a) shall be modified such that such Stockholder shall vote
(or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all of such Stockholders
Subject Shares in a manner that is proportionate to the manner in which all
Shares (other than the Shares voted by such Stockholder) which are voted in
respect of such matter, are voted.

 



 

SECTION 4. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of, or with respect to, any Subject Shares. All rights, ownership
and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain
vested in and belong to the Stockholders, and this Agreement shall not confer
any right, power or authority upon Parent or any other Person (a) to direct
the Stockholders in the voting of any of the Subject Shares, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, or (b) in the performance of any of
the Stockholders duties or responsibilities as officers or directors, as
applicable, of the Company.

 



 

SECTION 5. _No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals_. Each Stockholder hereby
represents and warrants that such Stockholder has read Section 5.3 of the
Merger Agreement. In addition, each Stockholder, solely in such Stockholders
capacity as a stockholder of the Company, agrees that neither it nor any of
its affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) nor any of its and
their respective directors, officers or employees shall, and each Stockholder
shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
affiliates(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, take any action that would violate Section 5.3 of
the Merger Agreement if such Stockholder were deemed a "Representative" of the
Company for purposes of such Section 5.3 of the Merger Agreement; _provided_
that to the extent that the Company is permitted to take any action and/ or
not prohibited from taking any action pursuant to Section 5.3, such
Stockholder also shall be so permitted and/or not prohibited; _provided,
further,_ the foregoing shall not serve to limit or restrict any actions taken
by such Stockholder in any capacity other than as stockholder of the Company.
Each Stockholder shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) in the event that such Stockholder receives any Acquisition Proposal or
an inquiry that could reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, no
Stockholder shall be required to provide such notice unless and to the extent
that the Company would be required to provide notice to Parent pursuant to
Section 5.3 of the Merger Agreement if such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry
had been received by the Company at such time.

 



 

SECTION 6. _No Solicitation of Employees_. From the date of this Agreement
until the two (2) year anniversary of the date of the Closing, each
Stockholder and its affiliated investment funds shall not, and shall not
knowingly cause any of the companies that are controlled by or invested in by
such Stockholder or any of its affiliated investment funds, directly or
indirectly, solicit (other than through general advertisements or executive
searches not specifically directed at the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective employees) or hire, or attempt to solicit (other
than through general advertisements or executive searches not specifically
directed at the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
employees) or hire, any individual listed on _Schedule II_ to this Agreement,
unless at the time of such solicitation or hiring, such Person had ceased to
be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective successors) for at least six (6) months prior to the time of such
solicitation or hiring.

 



 

SECTION 7. _No Appraisal_. Each Stockholder (i) knowingly, voluntarily,
intentionally, unconditionally and irrevocably waives and agrees not to
exercise any rights (including, without limitation, under Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law) to demand appraisal of any of the Subject
Shares or rights to dissent from the Merger that such Stockholder may have
(collectively, " _Appraisal Rights_ ") or to receive notice of any right to
seek Appraisal Rights in connection with the Merger; (ii) agrees not to
commence, participate in or voluntarily aid in any way any claim or proceeding
to seek (or file any petition related to) Appraisal Rights in connection with
the Merger; and (iii) agrees not to commence, participate in or voluntarily
aid in any way, and will take all actions necessary to opt out of, any class
in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise,
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Representatives or successors relating to the negotiation, execution or
delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger, including any claim (x) challenging the validity of, or seeking to
enjoin the operation of, any provision of this Agreement or (y) alleging a
breach of any fiduciary duty of the Company Board in connection with the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby; provided, that the
foregoing covenants shall not be deemed a consent to or waiver of any rights
of the Stockholder for any breach of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Termination Equity Commitment Letter by
Parent or its affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 8. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the five (5) year anniversary of the
date of Agreement, each Stockholder agrees, and agrees to cause its affiliated
investment funds to and to instruct its and their Representatives to, keep
confidential all nonpublic information in their possession regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Confidential Information_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that such Stockholders, their affiliated investment funds and
their respective Representatives shall not be required to maintain as
confidential any Confidential Information that (a) becomes generally available
to the public other than as a result of disclosure (x) by such Person or any
of their respective affiliates or Representatives or (y) to the knowledge of
such

 



      
 

 



 

Person and its Representatives, by any other Person in violation of an
obligation or duty of confidentiality to the Company or (b) such Person is
required pursuant to the terms of a valid order issued, promulgated or entered
by or with any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or any applicable
Law to disclose to such Governmental Entity (provided, that with respect to
this clause (b), such Person shall (i) to the extent legally permissible,
prior to the disclosing of any Confidential Information, provide Parent with
prompt notice of such order and provide commercially reasonable assistance and
cooperation with all efforts of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in obtaining a protective order or
other remedy (at Parents sole cost and expense) and (ii) disclose such
Confidential Information only to the extent required by such order or Law and
request confidential treatment thereof).

 



 

(b) Promptly following the Closing (and in any event within ten (10) days)
each Stockholder shall (and shall instruct its and its affiliated investment
funds Representatives to) either (at its option) return to Parent or destroy
(and confirm in writing to Parent by an authorized officer supervising such
destruction) all copies or other reproductions of Confidential Information, in
its possession or the possession of any of its affiliated investment funds and
shall not retain any copies or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of
such materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders, their
affiliated investment funds and their respective Representatives may retain
copies of Confidential Information in accordance with internal policies and
procedures to comply with applicable Law or professional standards or a bona
fide document retention program and will only be required to destroy
electronic versions to the extent reasonably practical. All Confidential
Information that is not returned or destroyed, shall remain subject to the
confidentiality and use provisions of this Section 8 notwithstanding any
provision hereof to the contrary.

 



 

SECTION 9. _Representations, Warranties and Other Agreements of Stockholders_.
Each Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent as of the date
hereof and, as applicable, covenants, that:

 



 

(a) (i) such Stockholder is the beneficial owner of, and has good, valid and
marketable title to, the Subject Shares set forth opposite its name on
_Schedule I_ , (ii) such Stockholder or its affiliates has sole voting power,
and sole power of disposition, in each case either individually or through
such Stockholders representatives, with respect to all of its Subject Shares,
(iii) the Subject Shares owned by such Stockholder are all of the equity
securities of the Company owned, either of record or beneficially, by such
Stockholder as of the date hereof, (iv) the Subject Shares owned by such
Stockholder are free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, any
Liens created by this Agreement, the underlying agreements pursuant to which
such shares were issued or as imposed by applicable securities Laws and (v)
such Stockholder has not appointed or granted any proxy inconsistent with this
Agreement, which appointment or grant is still effective, with respect to the
Subject Shares.

 



 

(b) such Stockholder has full power and authority to make, enter into and
carry out the terms of this Agreement applicable to such Stockholder;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) such Stockholder shall not bring, commence, institute, maintain,
prosecute, participate in or voluntarily aid any action, claim, suit or cause
of action, in law or in equity, in any court or before any Governmental
Entity, which alleges that (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Stockholder and the granting of any proxies to be delivered in connection
with the execution of the Merger Agreement, or (ii) the approval of the Merger
Agreement by the Company Board, breaches any fiduciary duty of the Company
Board or any member thereof or such Stockholder or any other Stockholder;

 



 

(d) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not, result in
a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse
of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration) (whether after the giving of
notice of or the passage of time or both) under any applicable Law, any of
such Stockholders certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent
governing documents or any contract to which such Stockholder is a party or
which is binding on such Stockholder or such Stockholders Subject Shares, and
will not result in the creation of any Lien on any of such Stockholders
Subject Shares;

 



 

(e) this Agreement has been duly executed by such Stockholder and constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable
against such Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity;

 



 

(f) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not, require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity by such Stockholder, (i) except for
any applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, and (ii) except
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or delay
the performance by such Stockholder of such Stockholders obligations under
this Agreement in any material respect;

 



 

(g) such Stockholder agrees that, in the event of any stock split, stock
dividend or distribution, or any change in the Subject Shares by reason of any
split-up, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination,
reclassification, exchange of shares or the like, the term "Subject Shares"
shall be deemed to refer to and include such Subject Shares as well as all
shares distributed in such stock dividends and distributions and any
securities into which or for which any or all of such Subject Shares may be
changed or exchanged or which are received in such transaction, and such
Stockholder agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, to promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four hours) notify Parent of the number of any new

 



      
 

 



 

Subject Shares, if any, acquired by such Stockholder or any of its affiliates
after the date hereof; and

 



 

(h) such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into
the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such Stockholders execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the representations and warranties of such
Stockholder contained herein.

 



 

SECTION 10. _Consent_. Each Stockholder on behalf of itself only consents to
and authorizes the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates to (and
Parent authorizes the Stockholder to) (a) publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement, any current report of the Company on Form 8-K and any other
documents required to be filed with the SEC or any regulatory authority in
connection with the Merger Agreement, such Stockholders identity and
ownership of Subject Shares and the nature of such Stockholders commitments,
arrangements and understandings under this Agreement and (b) file this
Agreement as an exhibit to the extent required to be filed with the SEC or any
regulatory authority relating to the Merger.

 



 

SECTION 11. _Stockholder Capacity_. To the extent that any Stockholder or any
of its affiliates or Representatives is an officer or director of the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as preventing or otherwise affecting any actions taken or not taken
by such Person in its capacity as an officer or director of the Company or any
of the Companys Subsidiaries or from fulfilling the duties and obligations of
such office (including the performance of obligations required by the
fiduciary duties of such Person acting in its capacity as an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries), and none of
such actions (or determinations not to take any action) in such other
capacities shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 12. _Merger Agreement_. Each Stockholder hereby acknowledges and
agrees to the last two sentences of Section 2.2(a) of the Merger Agreement,
including the treatment of such Stockholders Subject Shares.

 



 

SECTION 13. _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided
herein, this Agreement and any undertaking or waiver granted by the
Stockholders hereunder automatically shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect as of the Expiration Date; _provided_ that (i) _Section 16_
and, if the Merger is consummated, _Section 7_, _Section 8_, _Section 12_
and _Section 14_ shall survive any termination or expiration of this
Agreement, (ii) any such termination shall not relieve any party from
liability for any Willful and Material Breach of its obligations hereunder
prior to such termination, and (iii) each party will be entitled to any
remedies at law or in equity to recover its losses arising from any such pre-
termination breach.

 



 

SECTION 14. _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each Stockholder hereby
fully and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company
and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective past, present and future
successors, predecessors, assigns, employees, agents, partners, members,
subsidiaries, equityholders, parent companies, controlling Persons, other
affiliates (corporate or otherwise) and legal representatives, including its
past, present and future officers and directors, solely in their capacities as
such, and any past, present and future successors, predecessors, assigns,
employees, agents, partners, members, subsidiaries, equityholders, parent
companies, controlling

 



      
 

 



 

Persons, other affiliates (corporate or otherwise) and legal representatives,
including past, present and future officers and directors of any of the
foregoing, solely in their capacities as such (together, the " _Released
Parties_ "), from any and all manner of actions, causes of actions, claims,
debts, obligations, demands, liabilities, damages, costs, losses, expenses
(including attorneys and other professional fees and expenses), compensation
or other relief, whether known or unknown, matured or unmatured, contingent or
otherwise, whether in law or equity, arising out of, relating to, accruing
from or in connection with, (a) such Stockholders ownership of Shares and/or
other equity interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) the
Merger, any provision of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby (other than with respect to such Released Partys respective rights
under the Merger Agreement, including pursuant to Section 2.2 thereof), (c)
any appraisal rights or rights to dissent from the Merger, or (d) any claims
alleging a breach of duty on the part of the Company or any officer, director
or equityholder of the Company prior to the Closing Date (clauses (a) through
(d), collectively, " _Released Claims_ "), and agrees not to commence or
participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in,
any class action with respect to any Released Claims. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this paragraph shall affect any right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses in favor of, or limitation of liability of, a current
or former director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. It is the
intention of the parties that this Agreement shall, at the Effective Time, be
effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction, and release of the
Released Claims, and that the releases herein extend to any and all claims of
whatever kind or character, known or unknown. Accordingly, in furtherance of
this intention, the Stockholders expressly waive any and all rights under
Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California (or any similar law,
provision or statute of any other jurisdiction or authority) which states in
full as follows:

 



 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 



 

SECTION 15. _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall execute and deliver any additional
certificate, instruments and other documents, and take any additional actions,
as any other party reasonably may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out
and effectuate the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each Stockholder agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, to notify
Parent promptly in writing of the number and description of any Subject Shares
acquired by such Stockholder after the date hereof which are not set forth on
_Schedule I_ hereto.

 



 

SECTION 16. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant
to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on
behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party
taking such action of any other partys obligations to comply with its
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder (or any delay in asserting any such breach) shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder or in any other context.

 



 

(c) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

(d) _Assignment; Benefit_. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof,
no party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of each other party
hereto, except that Parent may assign its rights, interest, or obligations
hereunder to any of its affiliates so long as Parent continues to remain
primarily liable for all such rights, interest, and obligations. Any attempted
assignment without such prior written approval shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not be deemed
to, confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
heirs, successors, executors, administrators and permitted assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, or
to create any agreement of employment with any Person or otherwise create any
third party beneficiary hereto; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation
shall be an express third party beneficiary of _Section 12_ of this Agreement,
entitled to specifically enforce the provisions set forth therein.

 



 

(e) _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or
supplemented, except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by each of the parties hereto.

 



 

(f) _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur to Parent in the event that any provision of
this Agreement were not performed by the Stockholders in accordance with the
specific terms hereof, and that Parent shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent is entitled at law or in
equity. Each Stockholder agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and

 



      
 

 



 

other equitable relief to enforce the covenants and obligations contained
herein on the basis that Parent has an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity and Parent shall not be required to post a bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(g) _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims and causes of action
arising in connection herewith shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws
that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(h) _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Stockholders and Parent hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such proceeding
except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
Proceeding may be heard and determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding in any
such court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding in any
such court. Each of the Stockholders and Parent agrees that a final judgment
in any such proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
it by notice as provided in _Section 16(l)_ shall be deemed effective service
of process. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to
this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(i) _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER

 



      
 

 



 

PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 16(i)_.

 



 

(j) _No Agreement Until Transaction Documents Executed_. Irrespective of
negotiations among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not constitute, or be deemed to evidence, a contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto unless (i)
the Merger Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties thereto and (ii)
this Agreement is executed and delivered by all parties hereto.

 



 

(k) _Limitation on Recourse_. Section 7.5 of the Merger Agreement shall apply
to this Agreement _mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

(l) _Notices_. Any notices or other communications required or permitted
under, or otherwise given in connection with, this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered or sent
if delivered in Person or sent by facsimile transmission (provided
confirmation of facsimile transmission is obtained), (b) on the fifth Business
Day after dispatch by registered or certified mail, (c) on the next Business
Day if transmitted by national overnight courier or (d) on the date delivered
if sent by email (provided confirmation of email receipt is obtained), in each
case, as follows (or to such other Persons or addressees as may be designated
in writing by the party to receive such notice):

director, officer, trustee, partner, member, other fiduciary or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect
to employee benefit plans or public service or charitable organizations,
whether the basis of such claim or proceeding is alleged actions or omissions
in any such capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, trustee, partner, member, employee, other fiduciary or agent thereof,
against all expense and liability and loss suffered and expenses reasonably
incurred by such Covered Person in enforcing the provisions of this paragraph
(a) of paragraph NINTH (including attorneys fees, and disbursements, court
costs, damages, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and excise
taxes or penalties). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, except for claims
for indemnification (during the pendency of the disposition of such
Proceeding) or advancement of expenses not paid in full, the Corporation shall
be required to indemnify and hold harmless a Covered Person in connection with
a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the
commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was
authorized in the specific case by the board of directors of the Corporation.
Any amendment, repeal or modification of this paragraph (a) of paragraph NINTH
shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.

 



 

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by
paragraph (a) of this paragraph NINTH shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute
(including the DGCL), any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation
of the Corporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, any agreement, any vote of
stockholders or the disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



 

TENTH. If any provision or provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any
circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of Incorporation
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including,
without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of
Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect
its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in
respect of their good faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

Section 1. _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved
(including involvement, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or
threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as an employee or agent of the Corporation or as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any
other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all
expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees and related
disbursements, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time ("
_ERISA_ "), and any other penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation (or has ceased to serve,
at the request of the

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation, as an employee or agent of the Corporation or as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan) and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs,
executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in
Section 2 of this ARTICLE IV with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification or advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify
any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized in the first instance by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Section 1 of this ARTICLE IV
shall be a contract right and shall include the obligation of the Corporation
to pay, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an "
_advancement of expenses_ "); provided, however, that an advancement of
expenses incurred by an indemnitee shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking (an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (a " _final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this Section 1 or otherwise. The
Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification
and advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation with
the same or lesser scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers.

 



 

Section 2. _Procedure for Indemnification_. If a claim for indemnification
under this ARTICLE IV (which may only be made following the final disposition
of such proceeding) is not paid in full within sixty days after the
Corporation has received a claim therefor by the indemnitee, or if a claim for
any advancement of expenses under this ARTICLE IV is not paid in full within
thirty days after the Corporation has received a statement or statements
requesting such amounts to be advanced (provided that the indemnitee has
delivered the undertaking contemplated by Section 1 of this ARTICLE IV), the
indemnitee shall thereupon (but not before) be entitled to file suit to
recover the unpaid amount of such claim. Such persons costs and expenses
incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in any such
action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent
permitted by law. It shall be a defense to any action by a director or
officer for indemnification or the advancement of expenses (other than an
action brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of expenses where the
undertaking required pursuant to Section 1 of this ARTICLE IV, if any, has
been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards
of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, a committee thereof, independent legal
counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, a committee thereof, independent legal
counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The
procedure for indemnification of other employees and agents of the Corporation
for whom indemnification and advancement of expenses is provided pursuant to
Section 1 of this ARTICLE IV shall be the same procedure set forth in this
Section 2 for directors or officers of the Corporation, unless otherwise set
forth in the action of the Board of Directors providing indemnification and
advancement of expenses for such employees or agents of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 3. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on
its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to
become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,

 



      
 

 



 

employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan,
against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him or her and
incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expenses, liability or loss under the DGCL.

 



 

Section 4. _Service for Subsidiaries_. Any person serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose
equity interests are owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation (a
"subsidiary" for this ARTICLE IV) shall be conclusively presumed to be serving
in such capacity at the request of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 5. _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, persons who
after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or
officers of the Corporation or who, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a
subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and other rights contained in this
ARTICLE IV in entering into or continuing such service. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses conferred in this ARTICLE IV shall apply to claims made against an
indemnitee arising out of acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior
and subsequent to the adoption hereof.

 



 

Section 6. _Other Rights; Continuation of Rights to Indemnification_. The
rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this
ARTICLE IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have
or hereafter acquire under the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or
under any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors
or otherwise. All rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
under this ARTICLE IV shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation
and each indemnitee who serves or served in such capacity at any time while
this ARTICLE IV is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this ARTICLE IV or
any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other
applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification
and advancement of expenses of such indemnitee or the obligations of the
Corporation arising hereunder with respect to any proceeding arising out of,
or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the
final adoption of such repeal or modification.

 



 

Section 7. _Merger or Consolidation_. For purposes of this ARTICLE IV,
references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting or
surviving corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this ARTICLE
IV with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would
have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence
had continued.

 



 

Section 8. _Savings Clause_. If this ARTICLE IV or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and advance expenses to each person
entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under Section 1 of this
ARTICLE IV as to all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees
and related disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties,
and any other penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually
and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and

 



      
 

 



 

for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is available to such
person pursuant to this ARTICLE IV to the fullest extent permitted by any
applicable portion of this ARTICLE IV that shall not have been invalidated and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 



 

ARTICLE V

 



 

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

or these By-Laws require notice to be given to any Director or stockholder,
such notice may be given in writing by mail, addressed to such Director or
stockholder at his address as it appears in the records of the Corporation,
with postage thereon prepaid. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given
