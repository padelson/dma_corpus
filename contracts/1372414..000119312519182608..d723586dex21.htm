AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, subject to compliance by
the Company of its obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_), the
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence, within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase all of
the outstanding Shares for cash at the Offer Price. The consummation of the
Offer, and the obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and any obligation of Parent to cause
the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer), shall be subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer
and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares
which, together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned by Parent or any
of its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser,
represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding and no less
than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the
Company then outstanding and entitled to vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger (excluding from the number of tendered
Shares, but not from the number of outstanding Shares, Shares tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures (to the extent such procedures are
permitted by the Purchaser) that have not yet been delivered in settlement or
satisfaction of such guarantee) (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ ")
and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser (to the extent permitted
in _Annex I_ ), of each of the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_. For
the purposes of determining the Minimum Condition, the "number of Shares then
outstanding" and "number of shares of capital stock of the Company
outstanding" shall mean, without duplication, (i) the aggregate number of
Shares then-outstanding, _plus_ (ii) the aggregate number Shares subject to
then-outstanding vested Company RSUs and vested Company PSUs that have not yet
settled into Shares that are then-outstanding,  _plus_ (iii) the aggregate
number of Shares that the Company is required to issue upon conversion,
settlement or exercise of all then-outstanding Company Options for which the
Company has received notices of exercise or conversion and payment of the
applicable aggregate exercise price prior to the expiration of the Offer and
for which the Company has not yet issued Shares. Other than the Minimum
Condition, and subject to _Annex I_ , the conditions to the Offer set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ and clause (c) of the initial paragraph of
_Annex I_ are for the sole benefit of the Purchaser and may be asserted by the
Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions
(except if any breach of the Merger Agreement or other action or inaction by
Parent or the Purchaser has been a proximate cause of or proximately resulted
in the failure or the non-satisfaction of any such condition) and, subject to
the other terms of this Agreement (including _Annex I_ ), may be waived by the
Purchaser, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time.

 

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser (to the extent permitted by _Annex
I_ ), of each of the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser
shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, upon the Expiration Date,
cause the Acceptance Time to occur, and the Purchaser shall, and the Parent
shall cause the Purchaser to, accept for payment all Shares validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer upon the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time and pay for such Shares as promptly as practicable (and in
any event not more than two (2) Business Days) following the Acceptance Time.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid, without interest,
subject to any applicable withholding taxes. To the extent any such amounts
are so withheld and paid to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
amounts shall be

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth in _Annex I_. The Purchaser expressly reserves the right
to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, except as approved in advance by the Company
in writing, the Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall cause Purchaser not to,
(i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer (other than adding consideration), (iii) reduce the maximum number
of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum
Condition or the condition set forth in clauses (a), (b), (c)(ii), or
(c)(viii) of _Annex I_ , (v) add to or amend any of the other conditions to
the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ , (vi) except as provided in _Section_ __ _
1.1(e)_, extend the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner
that is adverse to the holder of Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
Shares), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
Shares, occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such action; _provided_ , that nothing in this sentence shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Offer shall initially expire at midnight (New York City time) at the end
of the day on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) (such date and time, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the
Initial Expiration Date has been extended as required by or otherwise
permitted by this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so
extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which
the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) If on the then scheduled Expiration Date, any condition to the Offer
(including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in _Annex
I_ ) has not been satisfied, or, where permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement and _Annex I_ , waived by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause the Purchaser to), extend the Offer for successive periods
of ten (10) Business Days each in order to permit the satisfaction of such
conditions until satisfied or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms. In addition, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to) extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or
positions of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") or its staff or any applicable stock exchange, including the NYSE.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer on more than two (2) occasions in
the event that all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
waived (if permitted hereunder) except for the Minimum Condition. Nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ hereof.

 

(f) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ , the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly return, and shall cause
any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(g) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
the Purchaser shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall include, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary
advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), (ii) deliver a copy of the
Schedule TO, to the Company at its principal executive offices in accordance
with Rule 14d-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (iii) give
telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a copy of the
Schedule TO, to NYSE, in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act. The Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and the Purchaser in writing all information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries and stockholders that may be required by applicable
securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or the Purchaser for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event of an Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent shall cause the Offer
Documents to disclose such event. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Offer Documents before they are filed
with the SEC, and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any
oral comments, that the Purchaser or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
such written responses and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchasers
obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding three sentences shall not
apply if an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred. Parent and Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as practicable
respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff regarding the Offer Documents.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date of the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC (which filing
shall not take place prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date of
this Agreement without the Companys prior written consent), the Company
shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall contain the Company
Board Recommendation, in each case, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_. The
Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 a notice of appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall also include in the
Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained all necessary consents of
the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to include in the Schedule
14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof
in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act
(regardless of whether such item is applicable). Without limiting _Section_ __
_ 1.1(g)_, the Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and hereby
approves and consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description
of the Company Board Recommendation; _provided_ that such consent shall
automatically be withdrawn, without any act of the Company or any
other Person, in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company
further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. To the extent
requested by the Purchaser, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares together with the
Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares. The Company, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly

 correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company
agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Purchaser and its
counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide the Purchaser and its counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt

mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner

addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to
whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the "
_Stockholder List Date_ ") and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its
agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and
beneficial holders of Shares. The Company Board shall set the Stockholder
List Date as the record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required
by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. In addition, in connection with the Offer,
the Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any Third Parties to, cooperate with the Purchaser to disseminate the Offer
Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Employee
Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. Subject to the terms hereof, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting
Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest,
subject to any applicable withholding taxes, upon surrender of such Shares in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares
that are owned by or held in the treasury of the Company, and all Shares
owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent
(including the Purchaser) or the Company, shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist, with no payment being made in exchange therefor.

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares
of common stock of the Purchaser shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
designate a nationally recognized bank or payment company to act as the
paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment and distribution of the
Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
At or promptly after the Effective Time (and, in any event, on the Closing
Date), the Parent shall (or shall cause Purchaser to) deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate
consideration that the holders of Shares are entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
the Option Consideration, the RSU Consideration, or the PSU Consideration).
Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Purchaser, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent
to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of the Purchaser, and no part of such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. For the avoidance of doubt,
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Shares pursuant to this Agreement. If, at any time following the Closing
and prior to the delivery of funds held by the Paying Agent to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, the cash deposited with the
Paying Agent is insufficient to pay the consideration that the holders of
Shares are entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, Parent
shall (or shall cause Purchaser to) promptly deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay such consideration.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented 

 



7

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by
book- entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_. As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days thereafter), upon (A) surrender of Certificates for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Purchaser and delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto or (B) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) and delivery of a letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, as applicable, the holders of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (y) the aggregate number of
Shares represented by such holders transferred Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, by (z) the Merger Consideration (less any
applicable withholding Tax pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_), and the
Certificates or transferred Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, and subject
to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable therefor upon surrender thereof in accordance
with the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(c) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid any
transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, and established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. From and
after the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares theretofore representing any Shares shall
(other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares,
which shall be subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_) cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
_Article II_ (or, for the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, any
consideration that remains payable with respect to any Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn in the Offer). The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and 

 



8

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to deliver Shares or
other capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to any
Person as a result of the exercise of or in settlement of Cashed Out Company
Options, Cashed Out Company RSUs, or Cashed Out Company PSUs, and that such
Cashed Out Company Options, Cashed Out Company RSUs, and Cashed Out Company
PSUs shall be cancelled and the holders of such Cashed Out Company Options,
Cashed Out Company RSUs, and Cashed Out Company PSUs shall only be
entitled to receive the consideration, if any, provided to them under
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and shall not have any other rights or remedies with
respect thereto.

 

(e) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
cash funds (including any interest or other earnings received with respect
thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, or their
respective successors in interest, (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_,
without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. If
immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation, Subsidiaries of Parent, the Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
that Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, such Subsidiaries or
the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, no Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and in respect of which appraisal rights shall have been
perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the
Merger (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be converted into a right
to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the
holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, but
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the
DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of the
DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
shall receive payment

 



9

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but only after the value therefor
shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the DGCL). In
the event that any holder of Shares fails to make an effective demand for
payment or fails to perfect its appraisal rights as to the Shares or any
Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then
any such Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ in respect of such
Shares as if such Shares had never been Dissenting Shares, in accordance with
and following the satisfaction of the applicable requirements and conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
(and in no event more than one (1) Business Day) of (i) any demand received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares (and shall give Parent the opportunity
(at Parents election and expense) to direct and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand) or (ii) any notice of exercise by
any holder of Shares of appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If
Parent elects to direct and control negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demand, Parent shall not (and shall not agree to), without the
prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or applications, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any
other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If
Parent does not elect to direct and control negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, the Company shall not (and shall not agree to),
without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or applications, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take
any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Company_ _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and does not constitute an Assumed
Option (" _Cashed Out Company Options_ "), by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be cancelled immediately
prior to the Effective Time and converted automatically at the Effective Time
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product, if any,
obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such
Company Option that are vested (after giving effect to any applicable
accelerated vesting in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to a Contract as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement to which such Company Option is subject) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Offer Price over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, no Option Consideration
shall become payable with respect to any Company Option cancelled in
accordance with this Section 2.4(a) that is not an In-the-Money Company
Option. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause payment of any
Option Consideration to be made to the holder of such right to receive the
Option Consideration into which the cancelled Company Option was converted, if
a current or former employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, through
the payroll system of the Company Employer or, if not a current or former
employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, through the Paying Agent, in
each case, payable as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and, in
the case of current or former employees of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date
of the Company Employer that is more than five (5) days following the Closing
Date, or in the case of a holder who is not a current or former employee of
the Company or a Company Subsidiary, in no event later than five (5) days
following the Closing Date).

 

(b) Each In-the-Money Company Option that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any applicable
accelerated vesting in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to a Contract as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement to which such In-the-Money Company Option is subject)
and is held by a Company Employee or Company Service Provider, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time
into an option to purchase Parent Common Stock having, subject to applicable
Laws, substantially the same terms and conditions as the In-the-Money Company
Option (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), except that (i) each such Assumed
Option will 

 



10

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 become exercisable in accordance with its terms for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares
that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such
product down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (A) the exercise price per Share at which such Company
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent and
(iii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans
and the stock option agreements will be references to Parent. The Company
will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any In-the-Money Company
Option (other than to implement any existing agreements or arrangements
for such acceleration in effect as of the date of this Agreement). As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent will make
available to each Person who holds an Assumed Option a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption of such Assumed Option by Parent.

(c) Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and is not an Assumed RSU (each, a " _Cashed Out Company RSU_ "), by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and
converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive an
amount in cash, if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
aggregate number of vested Shares underlying such Company RSU (after giving
effect to any applicable accelerated vesting in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to a
Contract as in effect as of the date of this Agreement to which such Company
RSU is subject) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Offer Price (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause payment of the RSU Consideration to be made to the
holder of such right to receive the RSU Consideration in which the cancelled
Company RSU was converted, if a current or former employee of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, through the payroll system of the Company Employer of such
employee or, if not a current or former employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former
employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, in no event later than the
next regularly scheduled payroll date of the of the Company Employer that is
more than five (5) days following the Closing Date), or in the case of a
holder who is not a current or former employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, in no event later than five (5) days following the Closing Date.

(d) Each Company RSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after giving effect to any applicable accelerated vesting
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to a Contract as in effect as of the date of this Agreement
to which such Company RSU is subject) and is held by a Company Employee or
Company Service Provider, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, shall be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit covering
Parent Common Stock having, subject to applicable Laws, substantially the same
terms and conditions as the Company RSU (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "), except
that (i) each such Company RSU will entitle the holder, upon settlement, to
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A)
the number of unvested Shares underlying to such Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding
such product down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, and (ii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company
Stock Plans and the Company RSU agreements will be references to Parent. The
Company will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any Company RSU
(other than to implement any existing agreements or arrangements for such
acceleration in effect as of the date of this Agreement). As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent will make
available to each Person who holds an Assumed RSU a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption of such Assumed RSU by Parent.

 

(e) The vesting of each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, accelerate in full as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and each Company PSU shall be cancelled immediately
prior to the

 



11

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Effective Time and converted automatically at the Effective Time into the
right to receive an amount in cash, if any, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Shares underlying such Company PSU as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Offer Price (the "
_PSU Consideration_ "). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
payment of the PSU Consideration to be made to the holder of such right to
receive the PSU Consideration into which the cancelled Company PSU was
converted, if a current or former employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, through the payroll system of the Company Employer of
such employee or, if not a current or former employee of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former
employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, in no event later than the
next regularly scheduled payroll date of the of the Company Employer that is
more than five (5) days following the Closing Date, or in the case of a holder
who is not a current or former employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, in no event later than five (5) days following the Closing Date).

 

(f) The Company shall send a written notice in a form provided in advance,
and reasonably acceptable to Parent (which acceptance shall not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld), to each holder of an outstanding Company
Equity Award in accordance with the Company Stock Plan that shall inform such
holder of the treatment of the Company Equity Awards, as applicable, provided
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ or otherwise in
this Agreement to the contrary, the conversion of Company Equity Awards

executed and delivered by Parent and the Purchaser, and, assuming due

any consent or approval under, violate, result in any breach of or any loss
of any benefit under, or constitute a default under, or result in termination
or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of Parent or the Purchaser or any Parent
Subsidiary pursuant to any Contract or permit to which Parent or the Purchaser

respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, with respect
to clauses (b) and (c), for any such conflicts, violations, consents,
breaches, losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens which, individually or

any Governmental Authority or any other Person, other than (a) the filing of

4.7 _Sufficiency of Funds_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent will have sufficient cash, available
lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds (including
the Companys cash funds) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to satisfy all of Parents and the Purchasers monetary
obligations under this Agreement, and will make available to the Purchaser
such funds, including the payment of the Offer Price in respect of each Share
validly tendered and accepted in the Offer, the payoff and termination of
Company Debt, the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Merger and the payment of all associated Expenses of the Offer and the Merger
to be paid by Parent.

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of (i)
the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) the fee letter related thereto with only
fee and other economic and "flex" terms redacted; provided, that, in
accordance with customary practice, such redacted terms do not affect the
conditionality of, the timing of the funding of, the availability of, or the
amount of cash proceeds available to Parent from the Debt Financing (as the
same may be amended or modified to the extent permitted hereunder, the "
_Redacted Fee Letter_ "). As of the date hereof, each of the Debt Commitment
and the Redacted Fee Letter is in full force and effect and, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or preferential transfers or other similar Laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and rules of Law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies,
regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at Law, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
its Affiliates that are party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent,
each other party thereto, to provide the Debt Financing, subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 6 of
the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Conditions_ "). Parent has
fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other
amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, the commitments
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated,
or rescinded in any respect (and, to the knowledge of Parent, no Financing
Source has indicated an intent to so withdraw, terminate, or rescind). As of
the date hereof, neither the Debt Commitment Letter nor the Redacted Fee
Letter have been amended or modified in any respect prior to the date of this
Agreement and no such amendment or modification is contemplated. As of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach by Parent or any of its Affiliates
(or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto), of any terms or
conditions, default, or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter. Except for the Redacted Fee Letter and related
arrangements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no side
letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the
Debt Financing to which Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates are a
party. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date other than the Financing
Conditions and, as of the date hereof, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ , Parent has no reason to believe that it,
Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates shall not be able to satisfy on a timely
basis any of the Financing Conditions. Parent and Purchaser understands and
acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Parents and the
Purchasers obligation to consummate the Transaction is not in any way
contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parents, Purchasers, or any of
their Affiliates consummation of any financing arrangements, Parents,
Purchasers, or any of their Affiliates obtaining of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to
Parent, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates.

4.8 _Ownership of the Purchaser; No Prior Activities_. All of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Purchaser are, and as of the
Effective Time shall be, owned of record and beneficially by Parent either
directly or indirectly through one or more of its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser has not and will not prior to
the Closing Date have incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary
or otherwise, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business
activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any Contracts with
any Person.

with the Companys independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving
effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ and (B) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law or (y) in response to an Intervening Event, the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal
advisors, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless the Company
(A) provides Parent with a written description of such Intervening Event in
reasonable detail, (B) keeps Parent reasonably informed of
material developments with respect to such Intervening Event, (C) notifies
Parent in writing at least four (4) Business Days before making an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event of its intention
to do so and specifying the reasons therefor and (D) during such four (4)
Business Day period, either (1) Parent does not make a bona fide proposal to
amend the terms of this Agreement or (2) Parent makes a bona fide proposal to
amend the terms of this Agreement that the Company Board considers in good
faith, but following which the Company Board again determines in good faith,
after consultation with its legal advisors and taking into account the terms
of such proposal, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the applicable Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Acceptance Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE
VII_ , the Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) none of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives has
breached this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ in any material respect as relates to such
Superior Proposal, including with respect to any related Competing Proposal or
Competing Inquiry (ii) the Company has provided written notice (a " _Notice
of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and the Purchaser that the Company intends
to take such action, which notice includes an unredacted copy of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of such action (including the identity of the
Third Party making the Superior Proposal) and copies of all relevant documents
(other than immaterial correspondence by electronic mail) relating to such
Superior Proposal, (iii) during the four (4) Business Days period following
Parents and the Purchasers receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, and shall cause the its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent and the Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Parent and the
Purchaser desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) following the end of the four (4)
Business Days period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and the Purchaser in response to the Notice of
Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
sentence, references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be deemed
to be references to a two (2) Business Day period.

Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any

 disclosure permitted under clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_ that

Person and (ii) neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall be required to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any

other obligation due to such Person.

cause its Representatives and Affiliates, if applicable, not to) issue any
press release or make any public announcement (to the extent not previously
disclosed or made in accordance with this Agreement) concerning this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written consent of (a) the Company, in the
event the disclosing party is Parent, the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
Representatives or (b) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives, in each case,
with such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if a party determines in good faith and
based upon advice of counsel, that a press release or public announcement is

consider any comments provided by such other parties, (ii) this _Section_ __
_ 5.6_ shall not in any way restrict the Company or create any obligations on

regarding the other parties, the Offer, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, and the
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable;
_provided_ that such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such
funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a
final, nonappealable judgment that such Indemnified Party is not ultimately
entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger), whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection with such Persons serving or
having served as an officer, director or other fiduciary of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or of any other Person if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws, and the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, or any indemnification, employment or other similar Contracts made
available to Parent. The Parties agree that the foregoing rights to
indemnification and advancement shall also apply with respect to any action
to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party and that all rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in
favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any
indemnification agreement in existence on the date of this Agreement and
provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the
terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
Indemnified Party notifies the Surviving Company in writing on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which
such Person intends in good faith to seek indemnification pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of
all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights of
indemnification, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing in favor
the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws, and the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, or any indemnification, employment or other similar
Contracts made available to Parent with respect to acts or omissions in their
capacity as directors or officers occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms (unless prohibited by applicable Law). From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each Company Subsidiary, to pay and perform in a timely manner such
indemnification obligations in accordance with their terms. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(d)_, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation and organizational documents of each Company
Subsidiary to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, exculpation, and advancement of expenses of directors and
officers of the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable, for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws or organizational documents of such Company
Subsidiary (unless prohibited by applicable Law).

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively,
the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies; _provided_ ,

 



46

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

  _however_ , that the Company shall not pay a premium for the DandO Insurance
in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement; _provided_   _further_ , that if the premium for such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Subsidiary (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.7_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect
any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ applies without the
consent of such affected indemnitee, subject to applicable Law (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Party to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_
applies shall be express third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
5.7_, each of whom may enforce the provisions hereof).

 

5.8 _State Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, the Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Parent, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement,
the Offer or the Merger, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto,
the Tender Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board shall take all actions
necessary to render such Takeover Statute inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

5.9 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

5.10 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company
or Company Subsidiary who continues employment at the Effective Time with
Parent, the Company, Surviving Corporation, Company Subsidiary, or any other
Parent Subsidiary (" _Continuing Employee_ ") annual base salary or base
wages and target bonus opportunity that are substantially comparable, to each
of the base salary or base wages and target bonus opportunity provided to
similarly situated, including, without limitation, in respect of geographical
location, employees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries and other benefits
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to either (i) the
benefits provided to Company Employees as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) the benefits provided to similarly situated, including,
without limitation, in respect of geographical location, employees of Parent
or the Parent Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
for a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent also
shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, the Companys standard
severance guidelines that have been made available to Parent and are in
effect as of the date of this Agreement for the payment of severance and
benefits to Continuing Employees whose employment terminates in accordance
with such guidelines.

 

(b) With respect to the employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries that are offered to the Continuing Employees after
the Effective Time (including any Company Employee Plans), including without
limitation accrued vacation, paid time off, and severance benefits (the " _New
Plans_ "), for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of
benefits (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or vesting
under any equity incentive plan), each Continuing Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before

 



47

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits or other welfare benefits to any
Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations,
waiting periods, required physical examinations, and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents, except to the extent such conditions would
not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Employee Plan
in which the Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
recognize or cause to be recognized the dollar amount of all co-payments,
out of pocket expenses, deductibles, offsets and similar payments incurred by
each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the year
in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
applicable co-payment, out of pocket, deductible, offset or similar
requirements under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which the Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

(c) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date that
Parent and the Company become part of the same controlled group pursuant to
Section 414 of the Code (the " _Controlled Group Date_ "), unless otherwise
directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Controlled Group Date, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary to effect the termination of any and all Company Employee
Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under
Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "). The Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that each such 401(k) Plan has been terminated
pursuant to an action by the Company Board.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment
for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any Company
Employee or Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii) require Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Employee Plan or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or Continuing Employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall create such rights in any such Persons.

(e) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to (i) cause
any offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased)
underway under the Company ESPP to be terminated no later than the earlier of
(A) the date immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) July 31, 2019 (the
" _Final Exercise Date_ "); (ii) make any prorated adjustments that may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but
otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully
effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company
ESPP; (iii) cause each participants option under the Company ESPP outstanding
as of the Final Exercise Date (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised
as of the Final Exercise Date; (iv) provide that no further offering periods
(or similar period during which shares may be purchased) shall commence under
the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (v) provide that
no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date
hereof may hereafter commence participation in the Company ESPP; and (vi)
contingent upon the Closing, terminate the Company ESPP as of no later than
immediately preceding the Effective Time. Any outstanding option under the
Company ESPP on the Final Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for
the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP. On the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date
under the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding
account for each participant under the Company ESPP will be used to purchase
Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each Share
purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time will be

Board pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, composed solely of "independent
directors" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and

Company (acting through a compensation committee of the Company Board or its
independent directors), shall take all steps that may be necessary or
advisable to cause each Company Compensation Arrangement and each Parent
Compensation Arrangement with any of its directors, officers or employees to
be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act (an " _Employment Compensation Arrangement_ "), and shall take
all other action necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive
safe-harbor with respect to such Company Compensation Arrangements and Parent
Compensation Arrangements in accordance to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , that the Company shall deliver to Parent drafts of
all calculations, resolutions, consents, disclosures and other documents
prepared in connection with the actions required under this _Section_ __ _
5.11(a)_, and provide a reasonable period of time for Parents review and
comment on all such calculations, resolutions, consents, disclosures and
other documents (and the Companys acceptance of Parents reasonable comments
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Parent Compensation Arrangement_ " means (i) any
employment agreement, severance agreement or change of control agreement
between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any holder of
Shares who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, (ii) any Company Equity Awards awarded
to, or any acceleration of vesting of any Company Equity Awards held by, any
holder of Shares who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company

direct or indirect Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any directors, officers
or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, from and after the date hereof
and until the Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan,
program or Contract pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former
director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into,
establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee (each
member of which the Company Board determined is an "independent director"
within the meaning of Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and
shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall
have taken all such steps as may reasonably be necessary to (i) approve as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program or Contract and
(ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program or
Contract; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall (a) promptly (and in
any event, within twenty-four (24) __ hours) inform Parent in writing of any
Action brought or threatened in writing by stockholders of the

 Company against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof (including by
promptly furnishing to Parent and its Representatives such information
relating to such Action as such Persons may reasonably request), (b) give
Parent the opportunity and right (at Parents expense) to participate in the
defense of any such Action, including in any and all proceedings related to
any such Action and the any proposed settlement or disposition thereof,
and (c) __ not cease to defend, consent to the entry of any judgment, offer
to settle, enter into any settlement or take any other material action with
respect to any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

5.13 _Exchange Delisting Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and
rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company and of

Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

5.16 _Financing Cooperation; Financing Matters_.

(a) The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide
assistance, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives to provide assistance, with the

 (ix) facilitating the pledging of collateral of the Company to the lenders
in the Debt Financing or the lenders in an Alternative Debt Financing to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent (which shall only be effective at
Closing) and (x) cooperating with Parent to the extent within the control of
the Company, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of
the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (u) none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their
respective Representatives shall be required to take any action or omit
to take any action, or provide any access or information if doing so would
(1) unreasonably and materially interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (2) violate applicable
Law, (3) cause the loss of or jeopardize any attorney-client, attorney-work
product, or similar legal or protective privilege (provided that the Company

result in a material violation or breach of, or default under, or otherwise
be prohibited by any Company Material Contract, (v) the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to prepare any pro forma financial

customary authorization letter, incur any other liability or give any
indemnity that is either (i) not contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing
or (ii) in connection with the Debt Financing, (x) no obligation of the
Company under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument required to

(y) no Representative of the Company shall be required to take any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in or cause any personal
liability on the part of any such Representative or any of its Affiliates, and
(z) nothing in this Agreement will require the Company Board to approve any

related thereto prior to Closing. Parent shall reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with the Companys cooperation and compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.16_. Parent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates, and its and their Representatives and any
successors and assigns of each of the foregoing Persons from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information used in
connection therewith, with such indemnification surviving the termination of
this Agreement, in each case, except to the extent arising from the willful
misconduct, gross negligence or fraud of the Company, its Subsidiaries, its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives and any successors and assigns
of each of the foregoing Persons. The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided that such logos are used solely (i) in a manner that is not intended
to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and its or their marks and (ii) in connection with a description
of the Company, its business and products or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. All non-public or other confidential information provided by
the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent will be permitted to disclose such information (i) as is legally
required to be disclosed in any offering documents related to any Debt
Financing or Alternative Debt Financing, and only with the written consent of
the Company, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld or (ii) to any
Financing Sources or prospective financing sources, ratings agencies and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
such financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents
in connection with such financing (and, in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors) so long as (i) such persons agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto or (ii) such persons are
subject to other confidentiality undertakings customary for financings of the
same type as the Debt Financing.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Debt Financing, including using reasonable
best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) satisfy
on a timely basis all Financing Conditions applicable to Parent in the Debt
Commitment Letter and comply with its obligations set forth therein, (C)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on or before

 the Closing Date on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or on such other terms as Parent reasonably determines are
substantially comparable or otherwise acceptable to Parent (but only to the
extent that such other terms, taken as a whole, would not reasonably be
expected to adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of
Parent to consummate the Transaction in accordance with this Agreement
or obtain the Debt Financing), (D) in the event that the conditions set forth
in _Annex I_ and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied, or upon funding
would be satisfied, using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing
Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing (including by enforcing
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to such Debt
Financing), and (E) consummate the Debt Financing. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of any breach or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware. Parent shall give the Company
prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any party of any of the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent such breach would impair or delay the
Closing or result in insufficient financing to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any termination of all or any portion of the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Without limiting Parents other obligations under _Section_ __ _
5.16(b)_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Parent shall (A) notify the
Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor promptly
after becoming aware thereof, (B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from the same or alternative financing sources (with
the Financing Conditions in such alternative financing to be, in the
aggregate, substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the Company than
the Financing Conditions in such unavailable Debt Financing), in an amount
sufficient, together with cash, available lines of credit and other sources of
immediately available funds of Parent (including the Companys cash funds), to
consummate the Transaction (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ "), as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, and (C) obtain, and when
obtained, promptly provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing
commitment (subject only to the Financing Conditions) that provides for such
alternative financing. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall, without
the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement, restate,
assign, substitute or replace the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, in a
manner that (1) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an
amount less than an amount that is sufficient, together with cash, available
lines of credit and other sources of immediately available funds of
Parent (including the Companys cash funds), to consummate the Transaction,
(2) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise adversely amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the Debt Financing, (3) adversely impacts
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or (4) otherwise adversely impacts or delays the ability of
Parent to consummate the Debt Financing or the Transaction beyond the Closing
Date or in accordance with this Agreement; provided that Parent may amend the
Debt Commitment Letter (I) solely to add additional lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents and similar entities, (II) to correct typographical
errors, (III) in accordance with the "flex" provisions of the Redacted Fee
Letter and (IV) to give effect to substitutions and replacements pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence. In furtherance of and not in limitation of
the foregoing, if all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but Alternative Debt Financing
is available on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent than the terms and conditions (including any flex
provisions thereof) described in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, then Parent shall obtain such Alternative Debt Financing and use such
Alternative Debt Financing to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Debt Financing.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if
the Company Board determines to enter into a definitive written Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal not solicited in
breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, but only if the Company shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal (and any Competing Proposal that was a
precursor thereto) and is otherwise permitted to accept such Superior
Proposal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall substantially simultaneously with such termination enter
into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pay the Breakup Fee pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_;

(f) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i)
there shall be an Uncured Inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement or breach of any covenant of the Company

reasonably likely to be satisfied, (ii) Parent shall have delivered to the
Company written notice of such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach, and (iii) either

(20) calendar days shall have elapsed since the date of delivery of such
written notice to the Company and such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach shall not
have been cured;

 

(g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) there
shall be an Uncured Inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Parent or
the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or breach of any covenant of Parent

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the Company shall
have delivered to Parent written notice of such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach;
and (iii) either such Uncured Inaccuracy or breach is not capable of cure or

forth on _Annex I_ (including the Minimum Condition) are satisfied or have
been waived.

 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this Agreement shall become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or
directors except (i) with respect to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b),_ this _Section_
__ _ 7.2_, _ARTICLE VIII_ , and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
each of which shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) with respect to
any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered as a result of the willful
breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or the Purchaser, on the
other hand, of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements set forth in this Agreement that occurs prior to such
termination. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful breach_ " means an
action taken or failure to act that the breaching party intentionally takes
(or fails to take) and actually knows would, or would reasonably be expected
to, be or cause a material breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, a failure by Purchaser (or Parent to cause Purchaser) to accept
for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the
Offer subject to the terms of and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ at a
time when all of the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex I_
(including the Minimum Condition) are satisfied or have been waived is a
"willful breach".

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to eleven
million four-hundred thousand dollars ($11,400,000) in cash (the " _Breakup
Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent within two (2) Business Days after
demand by Parent in the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.1(d), _terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_, or
terminated by the Company at any time that Parent would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_; or

(ii) (A) (1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ and the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied prior to such termination ( _provided_ , that the conditions to the
Offer set forth in paragraph (b) and paragraphs (c)(i) and (c)(ii) of _Annex
I_ are satisfied at the time of such termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_ and the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_ is then available to Parent), or (2) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ with respect to a breach of
covenant, (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior
to such termination of this Agreement, a Competing Transaction (as defined
below) shall have been publicly announced or shall have become publicly
disclosed and, in either case, shall not have been publicly withdrawn or
otherwise publicly abandoned by the Person making such Competing Transaction,
and (C) within twelve (12) months following such termination of this
Agreement, either (y) the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Competing Transaction or (z) a
Competing Transaction is consummated. For purposes of the foregoing, a "
_Competing Transaction_ " shall mean a transaction of a type set forth in
clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of " _Competing Proposal_ ";
_provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, all the
references to "20%" in the definition of " _Competing Proposal_ " shall be
replaced by "50%".

(c) In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid,
the Breakup Fee on more than one occasion. In the event that the Company
shall fail to pay the Breakup Fee when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent
for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by Parent and the Purchaser (including reasonable and documented
costs and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, together with interest on the
Breakup Fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ for the period from the date such
Breakup Fee was initially due to the date of payment. Each of Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ are an integral part of the Transaction, without which
the parties would not have entered into this Agreement, and the Breakup Fee is
not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and the Purchaser in the circumstances in which such
payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transaction, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. For the avoidance
of doubt, while Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance of
the obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.15_ and the payment of the Breakup Fee under _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_, under no circumstances shall Parent be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of such specific performance requiring the Company to
consummate the Merger and to pay the Breakup Fee (if entitled under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b))_.

 

7.3 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(c)_ and  _Section_ __ _
8.11(c)_, this Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and the
Purchaser by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of
directors at any time prior to the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

 

7.4 _Waiver_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(c)_ and  _Section_ __ _
8.11(c)_, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(ii) waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and

 



55

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 (iii) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

8.15 _Specific Performance_. Except as expressly provided in _Section_ __
_ 7.2(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.11(b)_, the parties hereto agree that if any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would
occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the

been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and any such
injunction shall be in addition to any other remedy to which any party is
entitled, at law or in equity. In connection with any action for

for proof of actual damages or the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the remedies referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 8.15_.

 

8.16 _Non-Recourse_. Without limiting any claim or recourse under or in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or against any of the Persons that
are expressly named as parties hereto, (a) any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transaction
(including the Debt Financing) may only be brought against Persons that are

covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of the Company, Parent or
the Purchaser under this Agreement or of or for any action, suit, arbitration,
claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether
based on Contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether
by piercing the corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto
