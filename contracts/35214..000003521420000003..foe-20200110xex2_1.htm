 \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, the Company (or its designee(s), including

Purchase Price \t\t

 \t\t\t. On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, in consideration of the sale, assignment and transfer
of the Shares and the Sold Assets, the Buyer on the Closing Date will, or will
cause its Affiliates to (a) pay to the Company or its designee(s) an aggregate
amount equal to $460,000,000 (the "Initial Value" and as adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.6(a) below, the "Closing Purchase Price"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars (or the currency of a foreign
country if payment in U.S. dollars is not permitted by Law in a foreign
country where a Seller is located as set forth in the applicable Local
Purchase Agreement) to an account of the Company or its designees designated
by the Company in writing and delivered to the Buyer at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, and (b) assume the Assumed Liabilities
(collectively, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.6(a) below and actually paid
at Closing and then as further adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.6(b)-(e) after
the Closing, the "Total Consideration"). The Initial Value will be adjusted
prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2.6(a). After the Closing Date,
the Initial Value will be adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.6(b)-(e). The
Initial Value, plus or minus the aggregate adjustment amount determined
pursuant to Sections 2.6(b)-(e) will be the "Purchase Price". For purposes of
this Section 2.5 and Section 2.6, any monetary conversion from the currency of
a foreign country to U.S. dollars or from U.S. dollars to the currency of a
foreign country will be calculated using the applicable exchange rates set
forth in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition as of the applicable
measurement date.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (s) \t\t\tPre‑Closing Statement. No later than twelve Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will prepare and deliver to the
Buyer a written statement (the "Pre‑Closing Statement"), together with any
relevant supporting materials, which will include a supporting trial balance
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be prepared pursuant to the
Accounting Methods)), setting forth the Company's calculation of a good faith
estimate of (A) the Closing Working Capital as derived therefrom (the
"Estimated Working Capital"), (B) the combined amount of Cash of the Divested
Companies and any other Cash which otherwise constitutes a Sold Asset
anticipated to exist immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Cash"), (C) the combined amount of Debt Obligations of the Divested Companies
and any other Debt Obligations which otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities
anticipated to exist immediately prior to the Closing (the "Estimated
Indebtedness"), (D) the combined amount of unpaid Transaction Expenses (the
"Estimated Transaction Expenses"); (E) the Unspent Capital Expenditure Amount
(the "Estimated Unspent Capital Expenditure Amount"), (F) the Cap Gemini
Excess Amount, (G) the Esfel Amount, (H) the Separation Delay Amount, (I) the

Value: (i) adjusted to give effect to the Estimated Working Capital in

  \t\t

  \t\t\t30  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

Transaction Expenses, less (v) the Estimated Unspent Capital Expenditure
Amount, less (vi) the Cap Gemini Excess Amount, less (vii) the Esfel Amount,
less (viii) the Separation Delay Amount; provided, that following the delivery
of such Pre-Closing Statement, the Company shall provide any additional
supporting materials and information reasonably requested by the Buyer and, at
the Buyer's request, meet with the Buyer and its advisors to discuss the Pre-
Closing Statement and shall consider in good faith the Buyer's reasonable
comments thereto for the purposes of determining the Closing Purchase Price to
be actually paid to the Company on the Closing Date. The Pre-Closing Statement
will be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Methods and presented in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit G. If the Estimated Working Capital (as
set forth in the Pre‑Closing Statement) is less than the Target Working
Capital, then the Initial Value will be adjusted downward by an amount equal
to the amount of the deficiency between the Target Working Capital and the
Estimated Working Capital. If the Estimated Working Capital (as set forth in
the Pre‑Closing Statement) is greater than the Target Working Capital, then
the Initial Value will be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the amount of
the excess between the Estimated Working Capital and the Target Working
Capital. If the Estimated Working Capital is equal to the Target Working
Capital, then no adjustment will be made to the Initial Value with respect to
the Estimated Working Capital. In addition, the Initial Value will be adjusted
upward by the amount of any Estimated Cash, adjusted downward by the amount of
any Estimated Indebtedness, any Estimated Transaction Expenses, any Estimated
Unspent Capital Expenditure Amount, the Cap Gemini Excess Amount, the Esfel
Amount and the Separation Delay Amount. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, subject to Section 2.6, the consideration for the sale and transfer of
the Shares and the Sold Assets set out in the Local Purchase Agreements will
be deemed to have been fully paid by the Buyer to the respective Sellers under
the Local Purchase Agreements upon payment of the Closing Purchase Price in
accordance with this Section 2.5.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (t) \t\t\tPost‑Closing Statement. Within 120 days after the
Closing Date, the Buyer will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Company
a statement (the "Post‑Closing Statement"), together with any relevant
supporting materials, which will include a supporting trial balance (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, will not be prepared pursuant to the Accounting
Methods)), setting forth the Buyer's calculation of (A) the Closing Working
Capital as derived therefrom ("Final Working Capital"), (B) the combined
amount of Cash of the Divested Companies and any other Cash which otherwise
constitutes Sold Assets immediately prior to the Closing (the "Final Cash"),
(C) the combined amount of Debt Obligations of the Divested Companies and any
other Debt Obligations which otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities actually
existing as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Final Indebtedness"),
(D) the combined amount of unpaid Transaction Expenses (the "Final Transaction
Expenses"), (E) the Unspent Capital Expenditure Amount (the "Final Unspent
Capital Expenditure Amount"), (F) the Cap Gemini Excess Amount, (G) the Esfel
Amount, (H) the Separation Delay Amount, (I) the Earn-Out Amount, and (J) the

to give effect to the Final Working Capital, the Final Cash, the Final
Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Unspent Capital
Expenditure Amount, the Cap Gemini Excess Amount, the Esfel Amount, the
Separation Delay Amount and the Earn-Out Amount. The Post-Closing Statement

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t31  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

in accordance with the Accounting Methods and presented in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit G. During such 120‑day period, the Company will, at the
request of the Buyer, on reasonable prior notice from the Buyer and during
normal business hours, afford the Buyer reasonable access to the books,
records and personnel with respect to the Business and otherwise retained by
the Company or its Affiliates (to the extent relevant to the determination of
the Final Working Capital, the Final Cash, the Final Indebtedness the Final
Transaction Expenses and the Final Unspent Capital Expenditures Amount) and
otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Buyer in connection with its
preparation of the Post‑Closing Statement. The Company will assist, and will
procure that its Affiliates assist, and cooperate with the Buyer in the
preparation of the Post‑Closing Statement. If the Final Working Capital (as
set forth in the Post‑Closing Statement) is less than the Target Working
Capital, then the Initial Value will be adjusted downward by an amount equal
to the amount of the deficiency between the Target Working Capital and the
Final Working Capital. If the Final Working Capital (as set forth in the
Post‑Closing Statement) is greater than the Target Working Capital, then the
Initial Value will be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the amount of the
excess between the Final Working Capital and the Target Working Capital. If
the Final Working Capital is equal to the Target Working Capital, then no
adjustment will be made to the Initial Value with respect to the Final Working
Capital. In addition, the Initial Value will be adjusted upward by the amount
of any Final Cash and any Earn-Out Amount, and adjusted downward by the amount
of any Final Indebtedness, any Final Transaction Expenses, any Final Unspent
Capital Expenditure Amount, the Cap Gemini Excess Amount, the Esfel Amount,
and the Separation Delay Amount.

 \t\t\t\t (u) \t\t\tDispute. Within 45 days following receipt by the Company
of the Post‑Closing Statement, the Company will deliver written notice to the
Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the Post‑Closing Statement (the
"Post‑Closing Statement Objection") setting forth a specific description of
the basis of the Post‑Closing Statement Objection, the adjustments to the
Post‑Closing Statement which the Company believes should be made, and the
Company's calculation of the Final Working Capital, the Final Cash, the Final
Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Unspent Capital
Expenditure Amount and the Closing Purchase Price as adjusted thereby. The
Company will be deemed to have accepted any items not specifically or properly
disputed in the Post‑Closing Statement Objection. Failure to so notify the
Buyer within such 45‑day period will constitute acceptance and approval of the
Buyer's calculation of the Final Working Capital, the Final Cash, the Final
Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Unspent Capital
Expenditure Amount and the Closing Purchase Price set forth in the
Post‑Closing Statement. During such 45‑day period, the Buyer will, at the
request of the Company, on reasonable prior notice from the Company and during
normal business hours, afford the Company reasonable access to the books,
records and personnel with respect to the Business (to the extent relevant to
the determination of the Final Working Capital, the Final Cash, the Final
Indebtedness, the Final Unspent Capital Expenditure Amount and the Final
Transaction Expenses) and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company in
connection with its preparation of the Post‑Closing Statement Objection. The
Buyer will have 30 days following the date it receives the Post‑Closing
Statement Objection to review and respond to the Post‑Closing Statement
Objection, and during such period the Buyer and the Company shall attempt in
good faith  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t32  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of the
foregoing items. If the Company and the Buyer are unable to resolve all of
their disagreements with respect to the determination of the foregoing items
by the 30th day following the Buyer's response thereto, after having used
their good faith efforts to reach a resolution, they will refer their
remaining differences to Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm refuses to accept
such engagement, another nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants as to which the Company and the Buyer mutually agree acting
promptly and in good faith or, if the Parties cannot agree within five (5)
Business Days, a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
appointed by the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales (in either case, the "CPA Firm") to resolve their dispute.
The CPA Firm will act as an expert not an arbitrator pursuant to this Section
2.6(c). As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than 15 days
thereafter, the Company and the Buyer will each prepare and submit a written
presentation detailing each Party's complete statement of proposed resolution
of the dispute to the CPA Firm, in each case solely in accordance with the
positions set forth in the Post-Closing Statement and the Post-Closing
Statement Objection, as applicable. The Company and the Buyer will cause the
CPA Firm to resolve such dispute in a manner that is consistent with this
Agreement. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the CPA Firm is
limited to the unresolved items on the Post-Closing Statement Objection. In
resolving any such unresolved disputed item, the CPA Firm (i) will not assign
a value to any item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item by
either Party or lower than the lowest value claimed for such item by either
Party in the Post-Closing Statement and the Post-Closing Statement Objection,
(ii) will make such determination with respect to the specific remaining
accounting‑related differences so submitted in such written presentations and
(iii) solely in accordance with the Accounting Methods. All fees and expenses
of the CPA Firm relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the CPA Firm
hereunder will be borne between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the
portion of the aggregate amount of the disputed items not awarded to the
applicable Party and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the
disputed items; provided that any initial engagement fees owed to the CPA Firm
will be initially paid 50% by the Company and 50% by the Buyer. For example,
if the Company challenges items underlying the calculations of Final Working
Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Cash, Final Transaction Expenses, Final
and/or Unspent Capital Expenditure Amount in the net amount of $1,000,000, and
the CPA Firm determines that the Company has a valid claim for $400,000 of the
$1,000,000, the Company will bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the CPA Firm
and the Buyer will bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the CPA Firm. The
Buyer and the Company each agree to execute, if requested by the CPA Firm, a
reasonable engagement letter. The Company and the Buyer will request that the
CPA Firm use its best efforts to render its determination within 30 days after
referral (or such later period as requested by the CPA Firm). All
determinations made by the CPA Firm will be limited to the matters submitted
to the CPA Firm by the Buyer and the Company and will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties and none of the Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates will seek further recourse from Governmental
Authorities, other than to enforce the CPA Firm's determination. Judgment may
be entered to enforce such determination in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The Company and the Buyer will make reasonably available to the
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t33  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

CPA Firm all relevant books and records, any work papers (including those of
the Parties' respective accountants) and supporting documentation relating to
the Post‑Closing Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA
Firm. The "Final Statement" will be (A) the Post‑Closing Statement in the
event that (1) no Post‑Closing Statement Objection is delivered to the Buyer
during the initial 45‑day period specified above or (2) the Company and the
Buyer so agree in writing, (B) the Post‑Closing Statement, adjusted in
accordance with the Post‑Closing Statement Objection, in the event that (1)
the Buyer does not respond to the Post‑Closing Statement Objection during the
30‑day period specified above following receipt by the Buyer of the
Post‑Closing Statement Objection or (2) the Company and the Buyer so agree in
writing or (C) the Post‑Closing Statement, as adjusted pursuant to the
agreement of the Buyer and the Company or as determined by the CPA Firm
together with any other modifications to the Post‑Closing Statement agreed
upon in writing by the Company and the Buyer prior to the determination by the
CPA Firm. The Parties' payment obligations under this Section 2.6 will not be
subject to offset or reduction by reason of any right or alleged right of
indemnification hereunder.

 \t\t\t\t (v) \t\t\tDownward Adjustment. If the Purchase Price set forth on
the Final Statement is less than the Closing Purchase Price actually paid at
Closing, then the Initial Value will be further adjusted downward by an amount
equal to the amount of the deficiency between the Purchase Price as set forth
in the Final Statement and Closing Purchase Price actually paid at Closing,
and the Company will pay or cause to be paid such amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to an account designated by the
Buyer. Such payment will be made within ten Business Days after the later of
the date on which the Final Statement is determined and the date when the
Buyer or the Company, as applicable, designates to the Company or the Buyer,
as applicable, the payment account details (such later date, the "Trigger
Date"). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (w) \t\t\tUpward Adjustments. If the Purchase Price set forth on
the Final Statement is greater than the Closing Purchase Price actually paid
at Closing, then the Initial Value will be adjusted upward by an amount equal
to the amount of the excess between the Purchase Price set forth on the Final
Statement and the Closing Purchase Price actually paid at Closing, and the
Buyer will pay or cause to be paid such amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. dollars to an account designated by the Company. Such
payment will be made within ten Business Days after the Trigger Date.

Allocation of Total Consideration \t\t

 \t\t\t. The Total Consideration, including any adjustments thereto, first
will be allocated among each of the Asset Sellers and each Divested Company as
set forth on Schedule 2.8(a). Second, the amount allocated to each Asset
Seller set forth on Schedule 2.8(a) will be further allocated among the Sold
Assets of each such Asset Seller using the methodology set forth on Schedule
2.8(b). The Buyer will send to the Company a proposed allocation of the amount
allocated to each of the Asset Sellers among the Sold Assets sold by each such
Asset Seller no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing

  \t\t

  \t\t\t34  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

comments, questions or objections with respect thereto no later than thirty
(30) days after the provision of the proposed allocation by the Buyer. The
Parties agree that the allocations of the Total Consideration pursuant to
Schedule 2.8(a) and Schedule 2.8(b) are in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and any other applicable Tax Law. The Parties will use reasonable efforts
to cooperate to comply with all substantive and procedural requirements of
Section 1060 of the Code any Treasury Regulations thereunder and any other
applicable Tax Law. Neither the Buyer nor the Company will take, nor permit
any Affiliate to take any position inconsistent with the allocations set forth
on Schedule 2.8(a) and Schedule 2.8(b). The Parties agree to use reasonable
efforts to notify each other with respect to the initiation of any inquiry,
claim, assessment, audit or Proceeding by any Taxing Authority relating to the
allocations and agree to reasonably cooperate with each other with respect
thereto.  \t\t

The Closing \t\t

in a Local Purchase Agreement, the closing (the "Closing") of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will take place remotely via the electronic
exchange of documents and signatures and deemed to be held at the offices of

legally permitted) of all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI and
ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied at the
Closing), or at such other place and time as may be agreed upon by the Parties
in writing (the "Closing Date"). All proceedings to be taken and all
documents to be executed and delivered by all Parties at the Closing will be
deemed to have been taken and executed and delivered simultaneously and no

delivered until all have been taken, executed and delivered. Legal title,
equitable title and risk of loss with respect to the Shares and the Sold
Assets will be deemed transferred to or vested in the Buyer (or its
designee(s)), and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
deemed effective for Tax, accounting and other computational purposes, and,
unless otherwise mutually agreed, the Parties will treat the Closing as if it
had occurred, as of 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date (or at such
other time and date as agreed amongst the Parties and set forth in the

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t37  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. If the Buyer determines that an amount is required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to any amounts payable (other than as
compensation), at least five (5) days prior to the date the applicable payment
is scheduled to be made, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide the Company with written notice of its intent to deduct and
withhold, which notice shall include a copy of the calculation of the amount
to be deducted and withheld and a reference to the applicable provision of Law
pursuant to which such deduction and withholding is required, and the Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to eliminate or reduce the basis
for such deduction or withholding (including providing the Company with a

as reasonably practicable after receipt of such notice, the Company and the
Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to agree an
economically neutral method (including potentially the assumption of certain
accounts payable as mutually agreed by the Parties), and the Parties shall
procure that the steps required to implement the agreed upon method are
implemented prior to Closing to reduce the amount of the Estimated Working
Capital such that it does not exceed $285,500,000. The Company and the Buyer
shall discuss the proposed method in good faith and shall use their respective
reasonable endeavours to structure any necessary steps to be taken to
implement the agreed method in accordance with this Section 2.14 in the most
Tax efficient manner reasonably possible for all Parties. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThe Company shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to procure that, at Closing, each Divested Company shall hold the
"minimum Cash amount" set opposite that Divested Company's name in the table
in Schedule 2.15 ("Minimum Cash Amount"). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tIf and to the extent that, on Closing, the Cash held by
a Divested Company would, but for this Section 2.15, be greater than the
Minimum Cash Amount of that Divested Company, the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to withdraw (whether by dividend, distribution
or otherwise) the excess Cash above such Minimum Cash Amount from the relevant
Divested Company and procure that such Cash is distributed to a member of the
Remaining Ferro Group prior to the date the Company is required to deliver the
Pre-Closing Statement to the Buyer. The Company shall: (i) consult in good
faith with the Buyer and take into account the reasonable representations of
the Buyer prior to withdrawing excess Cash pursuant to this Section 2.15(b);
and (ii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to structure the withdrawal
of such Cash in the most tax efficient manner possible.

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tAttached as Schedule 3.4(a) are true, correct and
complete copies of the audited combined financial statements as of December
31, 2018 (the "Balance Sheet Date") and for the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017 (the "Combined Financial Statements") that reflect the Company's Tile
Coating Systems Business (as defined therein). The Combined Financial
Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Tile Coating Systems Business (as defined therein) as of December 31,
2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 in accordance with GAAP. The Combined
Financial Statements have been prepared from the separate records maintained
by the Tile Coating Systems Business (as defined therein) and may not
necessarily be indicative of the conditions that would have existed or the
results of  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t40  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

operations if the Tile Coating Systems Business (as defined therein) had been
operated as an unaffiliated company. Portions of executive compensation,
worldwide strategy, corporate development, legal counsel, worldwide marketing,
other corporate functions for the benefit of consolidated Company and certain
other expenses (in which case such allocations would not be material to the
Business as a whole) represent allocations made from corporate office items
applicable to the Company as a whole.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tThe Business has not operated as a "stand alone"
business within the Company, and the Tile Coating Systems Business (as defined
in the Combined Financial Statements) is not the same as the Business as
reflected in the Carve-Out Financial Information as set out on Schedule
3.4(d).

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tWithin the Business, there are legal entities subject to
statutory audits ("Statutory Accounts") as listed on Schedule 3.4(c). The
Statutory Accounts were:

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tprepared in accordance with the accounting practices
generally accepted in the relevant jurisdiction of incorporation and in
accordance with applicable Law at the time of issuance of the Statutory
Accounts,

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tshow a true and fair view (or equivalent required under
local registration) of the financial condition (including assets and
liabilities) of the relevant entity at the end of the relevant accounting
reference period and show the profits and losses of the relevant entity to
which they relate for the accounting period ended at that time, and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tprepared, unless otherwise expressly stated therein,
on a consistent basis with the accounts of the relevant entities for the
previous financial accounting year.

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tThe Carve-Out Financial Information on Schedule 3.4(d)
has been prepared in good faith, and when taken together with the adjustments
listed on Exhibit I of Schedule 3.4(d), to the Knowledge of the Company,
accurately presents, in all material respects, the operating profits and an
aggregate total of specified working capital accounts (being Accounts
receivable, Inventories and Supplies, Accounts Payable) of the Business, for
the indicated periods and as of the indicated dates and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, are free from material errors. The Carve-Out Financial
Information was not prepared on a GAAP basis. The financial information
contained in the Carve-Out Financial Information (prior to adjustments listed
on Exhibit I), was taken directly from the Company's local ERP system and/or
BPC consolidation system, which is the Company's system of record it uses as a
basis for the Combined Financial Statements.

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThe Buyer has delivered to the Company true and correct
copies of (a) an executed equity commitment letter to the Buyer (the "Equity
Commitment Letter") pursuant to which Lone Star Fund XI, L.P. (the "Investor")
has committed to provide the Buyer with equity financing in the amount set
forth therein, subject solely to the terms and conditions set forth therein
(the "Equity Financing"), to which the Company is an express third party
beneficiary and (b) an executed debt commitment letter (including all
exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto), with certain customary redactions
(including in respect of pricing information, but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, any provisions which relate to certainty of funding) from the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto to the Buyer (the "Debt Commitment Letter"
and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters")
pursuant to which the lenders, financial institutions, institutional
investors, and other financing sources named therein (collectively, the
"Lenders") have committed on a "certain funds" basis to lend the Buyer the
amounts set forth therein, subject solely to the terms and conditions set
forth therein (the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity Financing,
the "Financings") for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full
force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect and no such amendment or modification is
contemplated except as permitted by this Agreement. Each Commitment Letter, in
the form so delivered, is, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the other parties thereto, and upon execution by the
Buyer, will be a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Buyer, in each
case, except as may be limited by the General Enforceability Exceptions. As of
the date hereof, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are
no other agreements, side letters, understandings or arrangements, conditions
precedent or other contingencies which could result in the full amount of the
Financings not being available, relating to the Commitment Letters. As of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach, on the part of the Buyer
or, to the actual knowledge of the Buyer's officers, any other parties thereto
under any term or condition of the Commitment Letters. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financings, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters.
The Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by
the Commitment Letters to be paid by it on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, there is no
fact or occurrence that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to (i) result in any of the conditions to funding in
the Commitment Letters not being satisfied, (ii) cause either of the
Commitment Letters to be ineffective or (iii) otherwise result in the
Financings not being available on a timely basis in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t (j) \t\t\tUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, each Party will (and, to the extent applicable, will cause
their respective Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and

of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, the obtaining of all
necessary waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations from any third party
and the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed herein, none of the Company, the Sellers nor

fee or other similar payment to any third party from whom consent or approval
is required or requested from or by such third party in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to
obtain any such consent or approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, including this Section 5.3, the Parties each acknowledge and
agree that obtaining waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations from any
third parties as contemplated in clause (iii) of this Section 5.3(a) will not
be a condition to the obligation of the Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (k) \t\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and its Affiliates
will agree or commit to any and all divestitures, licenses, other disposition
of assets, hold separate, or other arrangements, including any action that
limits its freedom of action, ownership, control, existing relationships or
other rights with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any of its
businesses, properties, assets, products, or services, as well as, subject to
the Closing, the businesses, properties, assets, products, or services of the
Divested Companies or the Business, and agree or commit to any restrictions or
limitations on the conduct of its businesses, as well as, subject to the
Closing, on the conduct of the businesses of the Divested Companies or the
Business, as a condition to obtaining approvals from any Governmental
Authority for any reason in order to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including
taking any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that no: (A)
requirement for non-action, waiver, consent, approval or authorization of any
Governmental Authority;  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t69  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(B) Governmental Order or Proceeding; and (C) other matter relating to any
applicable Competition/Foreign Investment Law or other applicable Law, in each
case, would preclude consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by
the End Date (each a "Remedial Action"); provided, however, that the Buyer
and the Company (and their respective Affiliates) will not be required to take
any Remedial Action that is not conditioned upon the Closing and will not be
required to agree and commit to litigate or participate in the litigation of
any Proceeding involving any Governmental Authority or any other Person,
whether judicial or administrative, in order to: (A) oppose or defend against
any Proceeding to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or (B) overturn any Proceeding to prevent
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
defending any Proceeding in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
overturned, terminated or appealed any Governmental Order. In addition, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided and subject to the
Parties' (and to the extent applicable, their respective Affiliates')
obligations under applicable Law, neither Party will (and each Party will
cause, to the extent applicable, their respective Affiliates not to) knowingly
take, or cause to be taken, any action that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the satisfaction by the End Date of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.4, 6.5, 7.4 and 7.5; provided, however,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer will not
be required to take, or commit to take, or cause its Affiliates to take, or
commit to take, any Remedial Action that would constitute a Triggering
Divestiture; and provided, further, that nothing contained in this Section
5.3 shall limit the right of the Company to enter into a transaction (or
series of transactions) pursuant to which any Person or Persons acquire voting
control of the Company or substantially all of the assets of the Company
(including by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase, or other similar
transaction).

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tThe Buyer undertakes and agrees (and, to the extent
applicable, cause its Affiliates to undertake and agree) to file such filings
and applications for approvals and consents as are required under any
Competition/Foreign Investment Laws or other applicable Laws by 30 April 2020,
provided, however, that if: (i) the European Commission accepts a referral by
a Member State (as defined therein) under Article 22 of the Council Regulation
(EC) No. 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings, or
(ii) the Parties' respective antitrust counsel otherwise agree (acting
reasonably), such deadline shall, if reasonably necessary, be extended to such
later date as the Parties' antitrust counsel may agree (acting reasonably).
The Buyer will bear the responsibility for all filings fees associated with
filings pursuant to all Competition/Foreign Investment Laws and other
regulatory filings.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (m) \t\t\tEach Party will and, to the extent applicable, will
cause their respective Affiliates to (i) respond as promptly as practicable to
all inquiries and requests received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with Competition/Foreign Investment Law matters or applicable Laws
and (ii) not extend any waiting period under any Competition/Foreign
Investment Law or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not

case, with the prior written consent of the other Party.

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tThe Buyer shall and, to the extent applicable, shall
cause its Affiliates to (i) promptly notify the Company of, and forward to the
Company, any written communication from any Governmental Authority concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) give the Company
reasonable advance notice of any notification, submission or other
communication which it proposes to make or submit to any Governmental
Authority (be it under Section 5.3(b), Section 5.3(c) or otherwise) and (iii)
provide the Company with copies of such draft notification, submission or
correspondence and any supporting documentation or information reasonably
requested by the Company, provided that the Buyer shall, to the extent
required by Law, not be obliged to provide the Company with any confidential
information or business secrets, which information shall be provided to the
Company's counsel on a counsel-to-counsel basis only. The Buyer undertakes to
take any comments of the Company in relation to any such notification,
submission or communication into due consideration and incorporate them in
good faith where appropriate. The Buyer further agrees to keep the Company
fully informed as to the progress of obtaining approvals, or waivers, from any
Governmental Authority including, but not limited to, the filings listed on
Schedule 5.3(a). The Company and its advisors shall be entitled the
opportunity to attend all meetings, telephone calls or discussions with any
relevant Governmental Authority or other persons or bodies with respect to any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, unless such calls or discussions have not been scheduled
in advance and do not involve any substantive or more significant process
related aspects and make oral submissions at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion to the extent necessary or appropriate. In case the respective
Governmental Authority or other person or body prohibits the participation of
the Company or its advisors in such meeting, telephone call or discussion, the
Buyer shall, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances,
consult with the Company prior to participating therein and, following such
meeting, telephone call or discussion, furnish the Company with copies of any
written documents exchanged therein and a reasonably detailed summary of any
oral communications between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority or members of their respective staffs, on the other
hand with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
In addition, the Company and the Buyer will work together in good faith in
determining what, if any, Remedial Actions may be necessary to obtain
regulatory approval or clearance while keeping such Remedial Actions below a
Triggering Divestiture. If, in good faith the Parties determine that the
necessary Remedial Actions may exceed the threshold for a Triggering
Divestiture, then the Company may propose to the Buyer alternatives to such
Remedial Actions and the Buyer will consider such alternatives in good faith
in light of the Parties common objective of consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer
shall not be obliged to accept and pursue any such alternative proposed by the
Company.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tNothing in this Agreement will impose obligations on the
Company or any of its Affiliates to give the Buyer or its counsel, accountants
or other authorized Representatives access to information if such access could
reasonably be expected to cause any of the Company or any of its Affiliates to
be in breach of any duty of confidence or any other duty or obligation under
applicable Law (including Laws affecting privacy, personal information,
competition and the collection, handling, storage, processing, use  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t71  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

or disclosure of data) (provided that such Person shall have used their
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege (which efforts shall not require such Person to waive its
attorney-client privilege)).

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (p) \t\t\tIn the event that any Governmental Authority raises any
concerns regarding any of the Material Ancillary Agreements under
Competition/Foreign Investment Laws, the Parties shall work together in good
faith to address such concerns and restructure such Material Ancillary
Agreements in a manner to satisfy any requirements of the Governmental
Authority while providing the Parties with a restructured Material Ancillary
Agreement as comparable as possible to the original Material Ancillary
Agreement.

efforts to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to any of
the Sold Assets or the Divested Companies (including access to books and

the Company will, within five (5) days after delivery of such Tax Return,
notify the Buyer in writing of such objection. The Buyer and the Company will
negotiate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such objection. If the Buyer and the Company are unable to reach
agreement within three (3) days after receipt by the Buyer of such notice, the
disputed items will be resolved by the CPA Firm and any determination by the
CPA Firm will be final. The costs, fees and expenses of the CPA Firm incurred

 \t\t\t\t (w) \t\t\tFor purposes of this ARTICLE V, in the case of any Taxes
in connection with a period beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending
after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of such Taxes
apportioned to the Pre‑Closing Tax Period will (i) in the case of property
Taxes and any other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on and
including the Closing Date and denominator of which is the number of days in
the Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes including any Tax
based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during the Straddle
Period (and including, for the avoidance of doubt, any GILTI Inclusion or
Subpart F Income), be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable based
on an interim closing of the books and treating such Straddle Period as if the
Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing Date. The portion of Tax
attributable to a Post‑Closing Tax Period will be calculated in a
corresponding manner. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations will be made in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the relevant Divested Company to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Any Taxes  \t\t

   \t\t\t   \t\t

attributable to transactions which are taken outside the ordinary course of
business and not contemplated by this Agreement that occur on the Closing Date
after the Closing will not be apportioned according to the formula outlined in
this Section 5.5(b) but will instead be specifically allocated to the
Post‑Closing Tax Period. Except to the extent reflected as a Liability in
Working Capital or otherwise taken into account in the Total Consideration or
included in the calculation of the Debt Obligations , the Company will be
liable for any Taxes for the Straddle Period apportioned to the Pre‑Closing
Tax Period and the Buyer will be liable for the amount of such Taxes for the
Straddle Period that are apportioned to the Post‑Closing Tax Period.

 \t\t\t\t (x) \t\t\tPayment by the Company of any amount due under this
Section 5.5 will be made within ten (10) days following written notice by the
Buyer that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority is due,
provided that the Company will not be required to make any payment prior to
five (5) Business Days before such Tax Return is filed. In the case of a Tax
that is contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.6, payment of
the Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority will not be due earlier than the
date (i) a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code
(or any similar provision of Law) is made by the appropriate Taxing Authority,
(ii) an IRS Form 870-AD is executed or (iii) five (5) days prior to the date
that a payment by the taxpayer responsible for payment of that Tax pursuant to
Section 5.6 is due.

Procedures Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims \t\t

 \t\t\t. The Buyer will promptly notify the Company in writing of the
receipt by the Buyer or any Divested Company of any written notice from a
Taxing Authority of any Proceeding with respect to Taxes for any Pre‑Closing
Tax Period for which the Company or any of its Affiliates are liable under
Section 5.5(a) (a "Tax Claim"), stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim
and the amount thereof, to the extent known; provided, however, the failure
to provide such notice shall not release the Company or any of its Affiliates
from any obligations under this Agreement except, with respect to Section
5.5(a) to the extent that the Company is actually and materially prejudiced as
a result thereof. With respect to any Tax Claim that relates solely to a
Pre‑Closing Tax Period, the Company will have the right to elect to control
all Proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection
of counsel) at the Company's expense; provided, however, (i) the Company
shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed and consult with the Buyer with
respect to any issue relating to such Tax Claim, (ii) the Company shall
provide the Buyer with copies of all correspondence, notices and other written
material received from any Governmental Authority with respect to such Tax
Claim, (iii) the Company shall provide the Buyer with a copy of, and an
opportunity to review and comment on, all material submissions made to a
Taxing Authority in connection with such Tax Claim, and (iv) the Company shall
not agree to a settlement or compromise thereof without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. With respect to any Tax Claim that relates solely to a
Post-Closing Tax Period, the Buyer will have the right to elect to control all
Proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel) at the Company's expense; provided, however, the Buyer shall keep
the Company reasonably informed and consult with the Company with respect to
any issue relating to such Tax Claim, the Buyer shall provide the Company with
copies of all correspondence, notices and other written material received from
any Taxing Authority  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t75  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

with respect to such Tax Claim, the Buyer shall provide the Company with a
copy of, and an opportunity to review and comment on, all material submissions
made to a Taxing Authority in connection with such Tax Claim, and the Buyer
shall not agree to a settlement or compromise thereof without the prior
written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect to any Tax Claim that relates
to a Straddle Period or both a Pre-Closing Tax Period and a Post-Closing Tax
Period, the Parties will mutually control all Proceedings taken in connection
with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) at the Company's expense;
provided, however, that if, with the written consent of the other Party, one
Party is permitted to control the Tax Claim, the controlling Party will not
take or advocate any position that could reasonably be expected to result in
an increase in Taxes of the other Party or any of its Affiliates, without the
written consent of the other Party or any of its Affiliates, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  \t\t

Refunds and Tax Treatment \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (y) \t\t\tThe Buyer will remit or cause to be remitted to the
Company any Tax refund or credit in lieu thereof attributable to any
Pre‑Closing Tax Period received by the Buyer or any Divested Company, net of
any reasonable out‑of‑pocket costs and expenses attributable to the receipt of
such Tax refund or credit in lieu thereof within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of such Tax refund or credit in lieu thereof. At the Company's
request, the Buyer will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company
in obtaining such Tax refunds, including through the filing of amended Tax
Returns or Tax refund claims as prepared by the Company, at the Company's
expense, provided, however, there is no adverse impact on the Buyer or its
Affiliates in any Post‑Closing Tax Period; provided, further, the Buyer will
be entitled to any refund or credit (i) reflected as an asset in Working
Capital or otherwise taken into account in the Total Consideration, (ii)
attributable to any Post‑Closing Tax Period or (iii) attributable to the
carry-back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any net operating loss or other tax
attribute generated in a Post-Closing Tax Period. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (z) \t\t\tThe Buyer and the Company agree to treat any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 5.5, Section 5.6 and Section 5.7 as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

---|--- 

Post‑Closing Tax Actions \t\t

 \t\t\t. Without the prior written consent of the Company not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Buyer and its Affiliates
will not, and the Buyer and its Affiliates will not permit any Divested
Company or any of their Affiliates to, (a) amend, refile, revoke or otherwise
modify any material Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than required by applicable Law or in connection with the resolution of a
Proceeding), (b) make or change any material Tax election or accounting
period, method or practice with respect to, or that has retroactive effect to,
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than required by applicable Law or in
connection with the resolution of a Proceeding), or (c) initiate or enter into
any voluntary disclosure or similar program or arrangement and excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, the ordinary course filing of Tax Returns or pursuant
to Section 5.6.  \t\t

Employees; Employment Matters \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (aa) \t\t\tOffers/Transfer of Employment. Prior to the Closing
Date (or such time as is required by applicable Law), the Buyer will, or will
cause its Affiliates to, make an offer of employment, in accordance with the
requirements of this Section 5.9 and Schedule 5.9, to each Business Employee
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Non-Tile Employees) to be
effective as of the Closing Date unless such Business Employee is employed by
a Divested Company or is an Automatically Transferring Employee and the
Company shall comply with its obligations under Schedule 5.9. Unless such
Business Employees expressly decline such offer of employment, and subject to
applicable Law, they will be deemed to have accepted the offer and will
commence employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (as designated by
the Buyer) on the Closing Date. Where such offers are required, the Parties
will use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to encourage all such Business
Employees who are offered employment with the Buyer or its Affiliates as
described in this Section 5.9(a) to accept such offers of employment, (ii) to
effect the transfer of employment of each such Business Employee to the Buyer
or its applicable Affiliate by substitution of employer, three-party Contract,
assignment, or as may otherwise be required to obtain the consent of the
Business Employee in accordance with Schedule 5.9 so as to effect the transfer
of employment under applicable Law and (iii) to effect the transfer of the
employment of each such Business Employee to the Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate in a manner reasonably designed to minimize the obligation on the
part of either Party to pay such Business Employees any severance,
end‑of‑service pay or gratuity, dismissal compensation, or other separation or
termination payments or liabilities in connection therewith. If a Business
Employee accepts the offer then the Seller will waive the requirement on any
such Business Employee concerned to give any notice of termination of his or
her employment so that the Business Employee may take up employment with the
Buyer or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date. The Buyer will, or will cause
its Affiliates to, accept the automatic transfer and continue the employment
of the Automatically Transferring Employees as successor employers. All
Business Employees who continue employment with or who accept an offer of
employment with the Buyer, a Divested Company, or their Affiliates as of the
Closing Date will cease employment with the Asset Sellers or their applicable
Affiliates (other than the Divested Companies) and begin employment with the
Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer or continue employment with a Divested
Company effective as of the Closing Date and are hereinafter referred to as
the "Transferred Employees." Nothing herein will be construed as a
representation or guarantee by the Company that (i) some or all of the
Business Employees will accept employment with the Buyer or one of its
Affiliates or (ii) some or all of the Business Employees will become employed
by or continue in employment with the Buyer or one of its Affiliates for any
period of time. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (bb) \t\t\tCessation of Active Participation in Seller Benefit
Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, except as required by Law or
otherwise by this Section 5.9, all Transferred Employees will cease active
participation in, and any benefit accrual under, each of the Seller Benefit
Plans that is not sponsored by a Divested Company. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t77  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (cc) \t\t\tCompensation and Benefit Plans/Prior Service. Except
as otherwise required by Law, as of the Closing Date and for a period of one
year thereafter, for so long as a Transferred Employee continues employment
during such period, the Buyer will, or will cause its Affiliates or a Divested
Company to provide to each Transferred Employee base salary and wages and
ordinary course cash incentive opportunities (but excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any equity or equity-related incentive plans and/or arrangements)
that are no less favorable as a whole than those contractually provided to
such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. To the
extent not otherwise required by or resulting from the operation of Law, the
Buyer will recognize each Transferred Employee's service with the applicable
Asset Seller, Divested Company or any of their respective Affiliates or
predecessors as of the Closing as service with the Buyer and its Affiliates
for purposes of severance (unless the Transferred Employee has received
severance payments upon the Closing for the Transferred Employee's employment
with the applicable Asset Seller) and eligibility to participate in, vesting
under and accrual of benefits under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer in which Transferred
Employees participate on or after the Closing Date but only to the extent such
recognition does not result in duplication of benefits. For the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this Section 5.9 are without prejudice to the right
and ability of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (which, after Closing, shall
include any Divested Company): (a) to summarily dismiss any employee in
accordance with applicable Law; or (b) otherwise terminate any employee
subject (in case of (b)) to compliance with Section 5.9(d). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (dd) \t\t\tSeverance Benefits. The Buyer will, or will cause its
Affiliates or a Divested Company to provide each Transferred Employee
severance benefits which are required by applicable Law upon any involuntary
termination without "cause" (as such term is defined on Schedule 5.9(d)) that
occurs during the one year period beginning on the Closing Date. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ee) \t\t\tWelfare Plans. This Section 5.9(e) will apply to the
maximum extent applicable under applicable Law or any applicable collective
bargaining agreement or employment agreement. Coverage for all Transferred
Employees and their respective dependents under the Seller Benefit Plans not
sponsored by a Divested Company that are health or welfare benefit plans
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (the "Sellers' Welfare Plans")
will cease to be effective as of the Closing Date. The plans sponsored by the
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Divested Companies after the Closing)
that are welfare benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA
(the "Buyer's Welfare Plans") will provide coverage and benefits for all
Transferred Employees and their respective eligible spouses and dependents
effective as of the Closing. The Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Divested Companies after the Closing) and the Buyer's Welfare Plans will be
liable for all claims of any Transferred Employees and their respective
eligible spouses and dependents incurred on or after the Closing Date. The
Asset Sellers will retain responsibility and liability for all claims of the
Transferred Employees incurred before the Closing Date; provided that the
Divested Companies and any Seller Benefit Plan sponsored by a Divested Company
retain responsibility and liability for all claims of Transferred Employees
and any other participant covered by such plan whether incurred before, on, or
after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t78  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

5.9(e), a claim will be deemed "incurred" on the date that the event that
gives rise to the claim occurs (for purposes of life insurance, severance,
sickness, accident and disability programs) or on the date that the service
was rendered or the supply was purchased (for purposes of health care
programs). The Buyer will, or will cause the Divested Companies or their
Affiliates to, waive any pre‑existing condition limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under Buyer's Welfare Plans (but only to the extent such
pre‑existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods were
satisfied under the Sellers' Welfare Plans as of the Closing Date) and will
recognize (or cause to be recognized) the amount of all expenses incurred by
Transferred Employees and their respective dependents during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs under the Sellers' Welfare Plans for purposes
of satisfying the deductibles and co‑payment or out‑of‑pocket limitations for
such calendar year under the relevant Buyer's Welfare Plans. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ff) \t\t\tAccrued Vacation. The Buyer will, or will cause the
Divested Companies to, credit each Transferred Employee with the accrued and
unused vacation days to which such Transferred Employee is entitled through
the Closing, and any personal and sickness days, or other service based leave
entitlements, accrued by such employees as of the Closing Date. To the extent
that the Sellers or any of their Affiliates are required by Law to make any
payment with respect to such accrued but unused vacation and/or personal and
sickness days as of the Closing, the Buyer agrees to promptly reimburse the
Sellers for the amount of any such payment. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (gg) \t\t\tBusiness Employee Obligations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the following terms will apply, as indicated: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tTo the extent that (A) the applicable Law of any
jurisdiction, or (B) any collective bargaining agreement, labor agreement or
other agreement with a works council or economic committee, in each case,
which has been disclosed to the Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement,
would require the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Divested Companies)
to provide any more favorable terms of employment to any Transferred Employee
than those otherwise provided for by this Section 5.9 (or modify the period of
time for which such standards are met), in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then the Buyer will, or will cause one of the
Buyer's Affiliates (including the Divested Companies) to, provide such
Transferred Employee with such more favorable term, and otherwise provide
terms of employment in accordance with this Section 5.9. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tTo the extent provided under applicable Law, (A) any
employment agreements between the Company, any Asset Sellers or Divested
Companies or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Transferred Employee,
on the other hand, and (B) any collective bargaining agreements applicable to
the Transferred Employees, will, in each case, have effect after the Closing
as if originally made between the Buyer (or its designee) and the other
parties to such employment agreement or collective bargaining agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tThe Buyer will, or will cause a Divested Company or
one of their Affiliates to, assume any Seller Benefit Plan or portion of any
Seller Benefit Plan that, under the applicable Law of the relevant
jurisdiction, is required to transfer to the Buyer  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t79  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

or such Divested Company or their Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any severance, end-of-service
pay or gratuity, dismissal compensation, termination indemnity, seniority
premium or other separation or termination payments or liabilities owed to a
Business Employee arising in connection with or as a result of the closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
will be liabilities of the Company and will be the sole responsibility of the
Company as an Excluded Liability, provided, that for the avoidance of doubt,
any action taken directly or indirectly by the Buyer following the Closing
shall not be considered an Excluded Liability.

 \t\t\t\t (hh) \t\t\tAcquired Plans - Transfer of Assets and Liabilities.
Schedule 5.9(h) sets forth each "Acquired Plan" and indicates whether the
Acquired Plan is a "defined contribution plan", "defined benefit plan", or an
"other pension plan." 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tIn respect of each Acquired Plan that is a defined
contribution plan (a "DC Acquired Plan"), (a) the Buyer will cause one or more
plans maintained by the Buyer or its Affiliates to assume the Liabilities
associated with each Business Employee (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Non-Tile Employee) under such DC Acquired Plan as of the Closing Date, and
(b) to the extent that assets are set aside in a trust or other funding
vehicle to fund such Liabilities, the Company or its applicable Affiliate will
cause the cash value of the assets attributable to the accounts of each such
Business Employee under such DC Acquired Plan (the "DC Acquired Plan Assets")
to be transferred to the Buyer's applicable plan on or as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) all
DC Acquired Plan Assets will be transferred into the applicable plan's funding
vehicle and not into any bank or similar type of account maintained for the
benefit of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and (y) all DC Acquired Plan
Assets will be transferred in cash; provided, however, that, in the Company's
discretion (subject to consent from the DC Acquired Plan trustee if required),
all or a portion of the DC Acquired Plan Assets may be transferred in kind. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tIn respect of each Acquired Plan that is a defined
benefit pension plan (a "DB Acquired Plan"), (A) the Buyer will cause one or
more plans maintained by the Buyer or its Affiliates to assume the Liabilities
associated with each Business Employee (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Non-Tile Employee) under such DB Acquired Plan as of the Closing Date, and
(B) the Buyer will cause one or more of its trusts or funding vehicles for the
plans described in clause (A) to receive (i) the assets from the trust or
funding vehicle of any DB Acquired Plan that are required by applicable
statutory or regulatory transfer rules to transfer to the Buyer's applicable
trust or other funding vehicle and (ii) the Mexico DB Assets (collectively,
the "DB Acquired Plan Assets"). The "Mexico DB Assets" are the portion of the
assets held in a trust for the DB Acquired Plans listed under "Mexico" on
Schedule 5.9(h), other than the Mandatory Termination Indemnity, (the "Mexico
DB Acquired Plans") equal to the product of (1) the total assets held in such
trust multiplied by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
the Liabilities of the Mexico DB Acquired Plans associated with the Business
Employees (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Non-Tile Employees) (the
"Mexico Transferred Liabilities") and the denominator of which is the total
Liabilities for the Mexico DB Acquired Plans. For the avoidance of doubt, (x)
all DB Acquired Plan Assets will be  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t80  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

transferred into the funding vehicle of the Buyer's applicable plan and not
into any bank or similar type of account maintained for the benefit of the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (y) The Mexico DB Assets will be determined
within 10 days of the date the Company and Buyer agree the amounts in clause
(2) above (such date being the "Transfer Date") and will be based on the DB
Acquired Plan Assets valued at the Transfer Date and the Company shall procure
that the DB Acquired Plan Assets will be transferred to the Buyer's applicable
trust or other funding vehicle within 30 days of the Transfer Date and (z)
all DB Acquired Plan Assets will be transferred in cash; provided, however,
that, in the Company's discretion (subject to consent from the DB Acquired
Plan trustee if required), all or a portion of the DB Acquired Plan Assets may
be transferred in kind (such in-kind transfer to include underlying insurance
contracts funding the applicable DB Acquired Plan). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tFor the purposes of determining the Mexico Transferred
Liabilities and the total liabilities for the Mexico DB Acquired Plans, the
obligations shall be determined on an employee by employee basis by the
Company's actuary as of the Closing Date pursuant to US GAAP requirements. The
actuarial assumptions used (including, but not limited to mortality tables,
withdrawal rates, salary trends, price inflation and discount rates) will be
set using the same methodology as those used in the analysis provided by
Mercer in relation to transferring pension accruals and disclosed in the Clean
Data Room at document reference 8.6.2.24, but with the discount rate, price
inflation and related assumptions based on financial market conditions as at
the Closing Date. The liabilities determined by the Company's actuary (Mercer)
shall be reviewed and agreed by the Buyer's actuary. The Company's actuary
will provide details of his calculation of the liabilities, including the
actuarial assumptions adopted, within 60 days of Closing Date and use
reasonable efforts to provide any information reasonably requested by the
Buyer's actuary required in order to review and agree the pension accruals.
The Company will also provide the Buyer with a statement of the total DB
Acquired Plan Assets as at the Transfer Date. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iv) \t\t\tIn respect of all Acquired Plans identified as other
pension plans on Schedule 5.9(h) ("Other Acquired Plans"), the Buyer will, or
will cause one of its Affiliates to, continue to maintain each Acquired Plan,
and each Seller shall transfer and assign, or shall cause the transfer and
assignment, to the Buyer or one of its Affiliates all of its rights, duties
and liabilities, whether stated or otherwise, under and with respect to each
Other Acquired Plan in respect of or relating to Business Employees
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Non-Tile Employee) including all
statutory duties and liabilities, and the Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall
assume sponsorship of all such rights, duties and liabilities, statutory or
otherwise, and that such rights, duties and liabilities shall be Assumed
Liabilities.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tCooperation. The Parties agree to furnish each other
with such information concerning employees, employee payroll and employee
benefit plans, subject to confidentiality and privacy considerations, and to
take all such other action, as is necessary and appropriate to effect the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 \t\t\t\t (jj) \t\t\tIndemnities from Seller Indemnified Persons. The
Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and each Buyer
Indemnified Person from and against any Losses that any Buyer Indemnified
Person suffers, sustains or incurs arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tthe termination of the employment of any Business
Employee or Transferred Employee or Automatically Transferring Employee before
the Closing Date; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tanything done or omitted to be done by the Company or
its Affiliates, or any other event or occurrence, in respect of any Business
Employee or Transferred Employee or Automatically Transferring Employee at any
time before the Closing Date; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tany termination of employment of any Business Employee
who has refused an offer of employment made by the Buyer (or its designee) or
any Automatically Transferring Employee who has objected to such transfer
under the Regulations, or any other employee not employed in the Business who
has objected to the transfer of his employment from, or otherwise not been
transferred from, a Divested Company to the Company or its Affiliates in
connection with the carve-out of the Non-Tile Business from the Divested
Companies, in each case, regardless of when such termination occurs; and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iv) \t\t\tany failure of the Asset Sellers or their applicable
Affiliates to comply with any obligation to inform or consult with any trade
union, staff association, works council or any other representative of the
Business Employees or Transferred Employees or the Automatically Transferring
Employees in connection with the matters contemplated by this Agreement and/or
the Regulations or any failure by the Asset Sellers or their applicable
Affiliates to comply with any other obligation imposed on it or them under the
Regulations with respect to the Business Employees, Transferred Employees or
Automatically Transferring Employees. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (kk) \t\t\tWrong-Pocket Employee Arrangements. If, within six (6)
months of the Closing Date, any contract of employment of any person who is
not an Automatically Transferring Employee ("Excluded Employee") is deemed or
alleged to have been effected between such Excluded Employee and the Buyer or
its Affiliates or a Divested Company as a result of the provisions of the
Regulations, the Buyer or its Affiliates or a Divested Company may terminate
any such Excluded Employee's employment by giving lawful notice and the
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Person from
and against any Losses suffered, sustained or incurred arising out of,
resulting from or on connection with: (i) the termination of such Excluded
Employee's employment and (ii) any salary payable and any other benefits or
employment costs and/or other liabilities in respect of such Excluded
Employee's employment on and from the Closing Date to the date of such
termination. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ll) \t\t\tBuyer Indemnity. The Buyer agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons from and against any Liability or
Loss suffered, paid or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Persons in relation
to the wages, salaries, remuneration, compensation or any other benefits
arising out of the employment of any Business Employees (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Non-Tile Employee) of  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t82  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

the Divested Companies or any Transferred Employee on or after the Closing
Date and payable to or accrued by them on or after the Closing Date, including
annual leave, leave loading, long service leave, sick leave and, subject to
Section 5.9(j), any entitlement to severance or redundancy payments (other
than any severance payment, end-of-service pay or gratuity, dismissal
compensation, termination indemnity, seniority premium or other separation or
termination payments or liabilities which become payable as a result of, or in
connection with, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or anything done or omitted to be done by

 \t\t\t\t (mm) \t\t\tNo Right to Employment. Nothing herein expressed or
implied will confer upon any of the employees of the Company, the Buyer, the
Divested Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, any additional
rights or remedies, including any additional right to employment, or continued
employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

contrary, this Agreement will not constitute the actual sale, conveyance,

Shares or the Sold Assets contemplated by any such agreement, arrangement or
instrument will be consummated earlier than simultaneous with the Closing.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (k) \t\t\tThe Company and the Buyer will use their respective
reasonable best efforts, including cooperating with the other Party, to amend,
modify or split any Shared Contract such that the rights or obligations of

Contract prior to Closing solely with respect to the Buyer or its designee(s)
or otherwise terminate or eliminate any such rights and obligations of the
Company or its Affiliates (other than any Divested Companies) prior to the
Closing (such actions, the "Transition"), or if not completed prior to
Closing, as promptly as practicable thereafter, in each case at reasonably
limited cost to the Company or its Affiliates as a Transaction Expense
hereunder but which shall not be borne by the Buyer or any Divested Company;
provided that if the Company and its Affiliates do not obtain or structure an
arrangement to Transition any Shared Contract prior to Closing, the Company

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tWith respect to Shared Contractual Liabilities pursuant
to, under or relating to any Shared Contract, such Shared Contractual
Liabilities shall be allocated between the Company and the Buyer as follows:
(x) if a Liability is incurred solely in respect of the Business or the other
businesses of the Company and its Affiliates, such Liability shall be
allocated to the Buyer (in respect of the Business) or the Company (in respect
of the other businesses of the Company and its Affiliates); and (y) if a
Liability cannot be so allocated under clause (x), such Liability shall be
allocated to the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, based on the relative
proportion of total benefit received by the Business and the other businesses
of the Company and its Affiliates under the relevant Shared Contract, as
mutually agreed by the Company and the Buyer, with any disputes subject to the
applicable dispute resolution mechanism of the CPA Firm pursuant to Section
2.6(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Company and the Buyer

advisable or desirable to arrange and consummate the Financings on the terms
described in the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts,

representations and warranties applicable to the Buyer set forth in the
Commitment Letters, (ii) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters on the
terms and conditions contained therein until the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated (it being understood that the Debt Commitment
Letter may be replaced or amended as provided below), (iii) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained therein or on other terms in the aggregate not materially
less favourable, taken as a whole, (iv) enforce its rights under each
Commitment Letter, (v) cause its senior management as well as appropriate
Representatives of the Buyer and its Affiliates, if applicable, to cooperate
with the marketing and/or syndication efforts of the Debt Financing Sources
for all of the Debt Financing, (vi) timely prepare the necessary offering
circulars, private placement memoranda, or other offering documents or
marketing materials with respect to any Financing, (vii) commence the
marketing and/or syndication activities contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as promptly as practicable and (viii) consummate the Financings at or
prior to the Closing; provided, however, that if funds in the amounts and on
the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter become unavailable to the
Buyer on the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Buyer shall (x)
notify the Company in writing of such event, (y) use (and shall cause each of
its controlled Affiliates to use)  \t\t

 \t\t

reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the "Alternative
Financing") in amounts and otherwise on terms and conditions no less
favourable in the aggregate to the Buyer than as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (taking into account any "market flex" provisions related
thereto), and (z) use reasonable best efforts to obtain a new commitment
letter that provides for such Alternative Financing and promptly deliver a
true an complete copy thereof to the Company; provided, that if the Buyer
proceeds with Alternative Financing, it shall be subject to the same
obligations as set forth in this Section 5.30 with respect to the Debt
Financing. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe Buyer shall keep the Company apprised of material
developments relating to the availability of the Financings and shall give the
Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to the
availability of such Financings. The Buyer shall promptly (and in any event
within one Business Day) notify the Company of (i) the expiration or
termination of any Commitment Letter, (ii) any refusal by the Lenders or
Investor (as applicable) to provide, or any stated intent by the Lenders or
Investor (as applicable) to refuse to provide, the full financing contemplated
by any Commitment Letter, (iii) any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
the Commitment Letters or definitive document related to the Financings (in
each case involving the breach or default of a third party, only if the Buyer
is aware of breach or default), (iv) any change, circumstance, or event which
causes the Buyer to believe in good faith, for any reason, that it will no
longer be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financings contemplated by
either Commitment Letter on the terms described therein (and that Buyer will
not be able to obtain acceptable Alternative Financing) or (v) receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to
any (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financings or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financings (other than ordinary course negotiations).

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe Buyer shall not replace, amend or waive the Debt
Commitment Letter without the Company's prior written consent if such
replacement, amendment or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount thereof) unless there is a corresponding increase in the Equity
Financing, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions, or otherwise expands any
of the conditions, to the receipt of Debt Financing, (iii) materially extends
the timing of the funding commitments thereunder or (iv) effects any other
amendment, modification or waiver that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay or impede the Closing; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. The
Buyer shall provide to the Company copies of any commitment letter associated
with a replacement Debt Financing or Alternative Financing as well as any
amendment or waiver of any debt commitment letter (including the Debt
Commitment Letter) that is permitted hereunder (which may reflect customary
redactions).

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tThe Buyer shall not amend, alter or waive, or agree to
amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of
the Equity Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tThe Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
any Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of any Financing
or any Alternative Financing, subject to fulfilment or waiver of the
conditions set forth herein.

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tThe Parties acknowledge and agree, that the agreements

shall be a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.31. 

---|--- 

Separation Committee \t\t

 \t\t\t. Within twenty (20) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
the Parties will establish a separation committee (the "Separation Committee")
comprising an equal number (being no less than four (4)) of Representatives of
each of (x) the Company and (y) the Buyer, each of sufficient seniority and
expertise regarding the matters within the remit of the Separation Committee.
The Separation Committee will meet at least weekly or as otherwise agreed
between the Parties until Closing and for so long thereafter as is reasonably
necessary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Antitrust counsel
for each of the Buyer and the Company shall attend the meetings of the
Separation Committee (unless the Parties mutually agree only one such counsel
needs to attend). The main purpose of the Separation Committee will be to
consult with regard to the preparation, approval and oversight of the
implementation of this Separation Plan and the activity required to separate
the Business from the Company and its Affiliates as updated and amended by
mutual agreement of the Company and the Buyer (each acting reasonably and in
good faith) from time to time to enable the Business to operate on a stand-
alone basis by Closing without any business interruption in all but de minimis
respects. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Separation Committee
shall agree and set up an appropriate governance model which shall be tasked
to cover all aspects of the separation of the Business from the Company and
its Affiliates. In connection with setting up the governance model, the
Parties' respective antitrust counsel  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t103  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

will develop appropriate protocols regarding integration matters to ensure
compliance with applicable antitrust laws. The governance model will include
project teams made up of Representatives from the Company, the Business and
the Buyer. Such project teams will be engaged in various work streams so as
to help implement the Separation Plan. The project teams will report to the
Separation Committee. The Parties agree that the Separation Plan will cover
all functions in the Business as well as the separation of the Almazora site.
Each of the Company and Buyer shall ensure that it makes available at such
times as the Separation Committee and/or any of the project teams hereunder
may reasonably request their respective employees and consultants, employed by
or contracted to the Company or Buyer or their respective Affiliates who have
the required expertise, experience and knowledge relating to such functions so
as to implement the Separation Plan. For the avoidance of doubt the
Separation Committee will be a consultative body, the decisions of which will
not be binding on the Parties unless and until documented in writing and
signed by and on behalf of the Parties. Each Party shall provide and dedicate
such resources and personnel and do all things that are reasonably necessary
to fulfill its respective obligations and responsibilities under the
Separation Plan in accordance with the timetables and milestones set
out. \t\t

Environmental Matters \t\t

 \t\t\t. In the period between the date of this Agreement and Closing, the
Company shall procure that each Divested Company and each member of the
Remaining Ferro Group (with respect to the Business) shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to complete any audits, checks or
monitoring processes that are set forth on Schedule 5.33 on a timely basis
after the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to Closing and the
Company shall procure that each of the foregoing uses its commercially
reasonable efforts to undertake all other audits, checks and monitoring
processes required to be undertaken in accordance with applicable
Environmental Law on a timely basis. The Company shall notify the Buyer
promptly if the results of any such audit, check or monitoring process
identifies any non-compliance with Environmental Law or any unacceptable risk
to human health and the Company shall, or procure that the relevant Divested
Company or the Remaining Ferro Group (as applicable) shall, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to appropriately remedy any non-compliance
or any unacceptable risk to human health (at the sole cost and expense of the
Company) prior to Closing. \t\t

Split Fees \t\t

 \t\t\t. Buyer shall be responsible for all Split Fees subject to the amount
of Split Fees that are the responsibility of the Company under Transaction
Expenses.  \t\t

Transition Amounts \t\t

 \t\t\t. Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter after the
Closing Date, the Buyer and the Company will provide the other with written
notice of the Transition Amount, if any, it is owed under the applicable Toll
Manufacturing Agreements, Reverse Toll Manufacturing Agreements, the Supply
Agreements and/or the Reverse Supply Agreements, together with reasonable
supporting documentation, and such amounts will be netted against each other
and the Party owing the remaining net Transition Amount will pay the other
Party within 10 days such amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by such receiving Party. If the Parties do not
agree on the amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 5.35 the Parties
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t104  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

shall discuss in good faith to try and resolve their disagreement. If the
Parties are unable to resolve all of their disagreements regarding the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 5.35 within 90 days of the end of the relevant
quarter, the Parties will refer their remaining differences to the CPA Firm's
transactions dispute group to resolve their dispute consistent with the
dispute process set forth in Section 2.6(c) of this Agreement. \t\t

Employee Non-Competition Provisions \t\t

 \t\t\t. After the date of this Agreement, if any of the employees of the
Company or its Affiliates set forth on Schedule 5.36 (the "Scheduled
Employees") terminate their employment with the Company or its Affiliates
other than to become employed by the Buyer or its Affiliates at the Closing,
then the Company will enforce (and will cause each of its Affiliates to
enforce to the extent applicable) its rights under the non-competition
provisions in the applicable agreements with the applicable Scheduled
Employees and pay the applicable Scheduled Employees the compensation required
under such agreements to make such non-competition provisions operative and
enforceable. The obligations of the Company and its Affiliates under this
Section 5.36 will terminate (a) at the Closing with respect to the Scheduled
Employees who become employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates upon the
Closing and (b) upon the third anniversary of the Closing (i.e., coterminous
with the expiration of the Company's obligations under Section 5.12(a)) with
respect to any of the other Scheduled Employees.  \t\t

Governmental Authority's concerns; provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) will not be available to a Party in
breach of Section 5.3 or whose breach of any other provision of this Agreement

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tby the Company, if (i) the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the date required by Section 2.9, (ii) all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII have been satisfied at the time
of such termination if the Closing were held at the time of such termination
(other than conditions that by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing and which are, at the time of termination of this Agreement, capable
of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time), (iii) the
Company has irrevocably notified the Buyer in writing that (x) all of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI have been satisfied or waived (to the
extent permitted) at the time of such termination if the Closing were held at
the time of such termination (other than conditions that, by their nature, are
to be satisfied at the Closing and which are, at the time of termination of
this Agreement, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at
such time) and (y) the Company is ready, willing and able to effect the
Closing and (iv) the Buyer fails to consummate the Closing on or prior to the
third Business Day following the date of delivery of such written notification
to the Buyer by the Company. 

---|--- 

Procedure and Effect of Termination \t\t

 \t\t\t. A Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1 must give written notice of such termination to the other Party in
accordance with Section 10.7, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effective. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein: \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tthe Buyer will deliver to the Company all documents,
work papers and other material of the Company, the Divested Companies and the
Sold Assets relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreements; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tthe provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms and conditions
thereof; and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tthis Agreement shall become void and of no further force
and effect and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party to any
other Party, except that (i) the provisions of this Section 8.2, Section
5.29(c) with respect to the Financing Cooperation Obligations, Section 8.3 and
ARTICLE X shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) except as provided in
Section 8.3, if such termination shall result from a Willful Breach by any
Party, such Party shall be fully liable for any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by the other Party as a result of such Willful Breach; provided that
no amount  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t109  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

paid by any Party with respect thereto may exceed the amount of the Buyer
Termination Fee. The Confidentiality Agreements shall survive any termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and, subject to Section 8.3,
nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be construed to discharge or relieve any
party to the Confidentiality Agreements of its obligations thereunder.

 \t\t\t\t 8.11 \t\t\tBuyer Termination Fee. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tIn the event that: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(f); or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)the Company or the Buyer terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(b) if, at the time of such termination, the Company would have
been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f);  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthen promptly, but in any event within five Business Days after the
date of such termination, the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Company (or, if instructed by the Company in writing, its assignee) an amount
in cash equal to $18,400,000 (the "Buyer Termination Fee") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by
the Company (or its assignee) prior to such payment. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not otherwise
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Buyer fails to timely pay the
Buyer Termination Fee when payable in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and in order to obtain payment, the Company commences an action
that results in a judgment against the Buyer for payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee, the Buyer shall pay the Company its reasonable and documented
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in
connection with such action, together with interest on such amounts at the
prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tPrior to the Closing, other than in connection with the
enforcement of the Confidentiality Agreements and the Company's right to
receive payments of the Reimbursement Payments, if payable pursuant to Section
5.29, and subject to the Company's right to specific performance pursuant to
Section 10.15, the right to (i) terminate this Agreement in accordance with
its terms and (ii) to receive the Buyer Termination Fee from the Buyer, if
payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company
and its Affiliates against the Buyer, its Affiliates or the Debt Financing
Sources for any Losses suffered or incurred as a result of or failure to
perform Agreement (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) under this Agreement or the Commitment Letters or any of the other
agreements or the transactions contemplated by  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t110  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

this Agreement and the Commitment Letters in the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to the bases specified in Section 8.3(a). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)
and the basis for such termination is a Willful Breach by the Buyer, the
Company may pursue monetary damages against the Buyer for such Willful Breach;
provided, however, that (A) the maximum aggregate monetary liability of the
Buyer shall be limited to an amount equal to the Buyer Termination Fee and (B)
in no event shall the Company or its Affiliates seek to recover any money
damages in excess of such amount. For the avoidance of doubt, other than in
the case of the foregoing, or a claim for Fraud, a claim to recover any
Reimbursement Payments or a claim to recover the Buyer Termination Fee, in
each case, solely in accordance with applicable Law and the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company or any
of its Affiliates seek to recover any monetary damages from the Buyer or its
Affiliates. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tOther than the remedies described in the clauses (c) and
(d) above, neither the Buyer, its Affiliates nor any Debt Financing Source
shall have any further liability or obligation, whether remedy at Law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate (or limited liability company or limited
partnership) veil, by or through a claim against the Buyer, its Affiliates or
any Debt Financing Source and the Company covenants and agrees that it shall
not institute, and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to
institute a Proceeding to seek recourse for such further liability or
obligation. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) in no event shall the
Buyer be required to pay a Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion and
(ii) any payment of a Buyer Termination Fee (together with the Reimbursement
Payments) is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount
that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

 \t\t\t\tArticle IX \t\t\tINDEMNIFICATION 

---|--- 

Indemnification by the Company \t\t

 \t\t\t. From and after the Closing and subject to this ARTICLE IX, the
Company agrees to indemnify and hold the Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Divested Companies) and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and Representatives (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnified Persons") harmless from and against any and all losses,
Liabilities, Taxes, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys) (collectively, "Losses"), that any Buyer Indemnified
Person actually suffers, sustains or incurs arising out of, resulting from or
in connection with: \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t111  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tany breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation, or failure
of any representation or warranty, made by the Company or any Affiliates in
(i) ARTICLE III as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (or such
earlier date upon which such representation was expressly made) or (ii) any
Ancillary Agreement; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tany breach, violation or non-fulfillment of or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement of the Company or its Affiliates
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tany Excluded Liability; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\t(i) Almazora Soil or Water Contamination, or (ii) any
violation of Environmental Law before Closing by the Company or any of its
Affiliates (including the Divested Companies) at the Almazora Site relating to
the presence of Hazardous Material (the "Almazora Environmental Indemnity"); 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\t(i) Other Soil or Water Contamination, or (ii) any
violation of Environmental Law before Closing by the Company or any of its
Affiliates (including the Divested Companies) at the Argentina Sites, Mexico
City Site, Egypt Sites or Thailand Site relating to the presence of Hazardous
Material (the "Other Environmental Indemnity"); or 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tthe matters set forth on Schedule 9.1(f). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this ARTICLE IX,
(i) none of the Buyer Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover from the
Company for any Losses under Section 9.1(a) (other than with respect to
Fundamental Representations, Section 3.1(b), the Tax Representations or in the
case of Fraud) unless the total of all such Losses exceeds $2,300,000 (the
"Deductible"), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Persons will be entitled
to indemnification only for such Losses in excess of the Deductible, subject
to the Cap, (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Persons will not be entitled to recover
more than the Retention Amount (the "Cap") from the Company with respect to
all Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.1(a) (other than with respect
to Fundamental Representations, Section 3.1(b), Tax Representations or in the
case of Fraud), and (iii) the Company's aggregate liability for any claims for
indemnification under Section 9.1(a), Section 9.1(b), Section 9.1(d),
Section 9.1(e) and Section 9.1(f) will not exceed the Initial Value. The
Buyer Indemnified Persons will not be entitled to recover more than $4,000,000
in the aggregate under the Other Environmental Indemnity. Any claim that may
be asserted pursuant to Section 9.1(a) that may also be asserted pursuant to
Section 9.1(b) solely as a result of the Company's failure to provide notice
as required pursuant to Section 5.20 will be asserted solely pursuant to
Section 9.1(a). \t\t

Indemnification by the Buyer \t\t

 \t\t\t. From and after the Closing and subject to this ARTICLE IX, the
Buyer and its subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Divested
Companies), jointly, and severally, agree to indemnify and hold the Company
and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents
and Representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") harmless
from and against any and all  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t112  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Losses that any Seller Indemnified Person actually suffers or incurs arising
out of, resulting from or in connection with: \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tany breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation, or failure
of any representation or warranty, made by the Buyer or any Affiliates in (i)
ARTICLE IV as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (or such earlier
date upon which such representation was expressly made) or (ii) any Ancillary
Agreement; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (h) \t\t\tany breach, violation or non-fulfillment of or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement of the Buyer or its Affiliates contained
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tany Assumed Liability; or 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (j) \t\t\tthe matters set forth on Schedule 9.2(d). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this ARTICLE IX,
the Buyer's aggregate liability for any claims for indemnification under
Section 9.2(a) and Section 9.2(b) will not exceed the Initial Value. \t\t

Exclusive Remedy \t\t

 \t\t\t. The indemnification provided in Section 5.5, Section 5.9(j),
Section 5.9(l), Section 5.24, Section 5.29(c) and this ARTICLE IX, subject
to the limitations set forth herein, will be the sole and exclusive
post‑Closing monetary remedy available to any Party in connection with any
Losses arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the Buyer's ownership or operation of the Business,
whether based in contract or tort (including negligence) or otherwise
predicated on common law standards, strict liability or otherwise; provided,
however, that the provisions of this ARTICLE IX will not prevent or limit a
cause of action at Law or in equity (a) based upon Fraud or (b) under Section
10.15 to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, nor
will such provision prevent or limit the rights of the Parties with respect to
Section 2.6(c), Section 5.5, Section 5.9(j), Section 5.9(l), Section 5.24
and Section 5.29(c). Without limiting Buyer's rights to pursue any
indemnification otherwise available under this ARTICLE IX, the Buyer
Indemnified Persons expressly waive any and all rights and remedies against
the Company or its Affiliates under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. §9601 et seq. as amended, and other
Environmental Laws in connection with any Losses arising out of or resulting
from this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, or the ownership or
operation of the Business (as currently or previously conducted at any time)
or the Sold Assets. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer's sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to Losses for which it may be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1(a) (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations, Section 3.1(b), the Tax Representations or Fraud) will be
(subject to the limitations set forth in the other Sections of this ARTICLE
IX) to satisfy the amount of such Losses in the following order of priority:
first, from the Company up to the Retention Amount (subject to the
Deductible), and  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t113  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

second, from the RandW Insurance Policy, and, for the avoidance of doubt,
without any direct recourse against the Company or its Affiliates. \t\t

Indemnification Calculations \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (k) \t\t\tFor purposes of this ARTICLE IX the determination of
whether a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty has occurred,
been made or is continuing (other than the use of "Business Material Adverse
Effect" and "Seller Material Adverse Effect" in Section 3.9(b), "in all
material respects" in the second sentence of Section 3.4(a) and "material" in
the first sentence of Section 3.4(d)), and the calculation of any Losses
arising from the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty will
be determined without regard and without giving effect to the term, or, as
applicable, the clause containing "materiality", "materially", "material" or
"material adverse effect", "Business Material Adverse Effect" or "Seller
Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import contained in such
representation or warranty. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tThe amount of Losses recoverable by an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this ARTICLE IX with respect to an indemnity claim will be reduced
by the amount of (i) insurance proceeds or other amounts actually recovered by
such Indemnified Party with respect to the Losses to which such indemnity
claim relates net of the reasonable costs and expenses (including any
increases in premiums) incurred in seeking such collection and (ii) any Tax
benefit, in connection with such Losses, actually realized (taking into
account any reduction in Tax basis in connection with such Loss) as a
reduction of cash Taxes payable in the same Tax period such Loss was incurred
by the Indemnified Party. The Parties agree that any indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Agreement will be treated for tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

---|--- 

Survival \t\t

 \t\t\t. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements (to the
extent such covenants and agreements relate to the performance of obligations
prior to the Closing) contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing
Date until and will terminate, expire and cease to be of any force or effect
at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the first Business Day following the date that
is the 18‑month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that any Fundamental
Representations, the representation in Section 3.1(b) and the Tax
Representations shall only terminate, expire and cease to be of any force or
effect at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the first Business Day following the
date that is the six-year anniversary of the Closing Date. The Other
Environmental Indemnity will survive the Closing Date until and will
terminate, expire and cease to be of any force or effect at 5:00 p.m. on the
first Business Day following that date that is the five-year anniversary of
the Closing Date. The Almazora Environmental Indemnity will survive the
Closing Date without expiration except as provided in the Almazora Separation
Plan. All other covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement which
relate to the performance of obligations following the Closing Date will
survive the Closing Date in accordance with their terms, Section 10.18 and
applicable Law. All claims for indemnification must be asserted on or prior to
the date of the termination of the applicable survival period, except such
claims may be pursued thereafter if written notice thereof (specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such claim) was duly given within such
survival period. Any claim for  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t114  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

indemnification not made by the Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller
Indemnified Persons, as applicable, on or prior to the date of termination of
the survival period will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and
waived, whether or not a longer period would be permitted by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
survival period set forth in this Section 9.5 is applicable to the Buyer's
right to indemnification against the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(a) in
accordance with this Agreement, but is not intended to, and will not, modify
or limit the Buyer right to recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy in
accordance with its terms. \t\t

Notice and Opportunity to Defend \t\t

 \t\t\t. Subject to Section 9.7, if there occurs an event which a Buyer
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person asserts is an indemnifiable
event pursuant to Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, the Buyer Indemnified Person or
Seller Indemnified Person seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party")
will reasonably promptly notify the Party obligated to provide indemnification
(the "Indemnifying Party"), which notice will specify in reasonable detail the
nature and basis of such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known. If
such event involves any claim or the commencement of any action or Proceeding
by a third Person (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party will give
such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice (the "Claim Notice")
of such claim or the commencement of such action or Proceeding, which notice
will specify in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such claim and the
amount thereof, to the extent known, and will be accompanied by copies of all
relevant material documentation with respect to such claim, including any
summons, complaint or other pleadings that may have been served, any written
demand or any other relevant document or instrument; provided, however, that
the failure to provide such reasonably prompt notice will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. In the case of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to assume the
defense thereof with notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days from the
date on which the Indemnifying Party received the notice delivered pursuant to
the previous sentence, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of such election to assume the
defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof; although, for the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Party may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (provided, that if the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the
proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based
on the written advice of counsel, that the representation of both Parties by
the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual material conflict of
interest between them, each of the Parties shall retain separate counsel at
its own expense); provided, that the Indemnifying Party must control such
defense in good faith. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree
to cooperate reasonably with each other and their respective counsel in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim, except if in a Party's reasonable determination such access and
cooperation could violate any applicable Law, or could result in a loss or
waiver any legal or attorney-client privilege or confidentiality protections
or obligations. Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section 9.6 to
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t115  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

the contrary, the Indemnified Party will at all times have the right to
participate at its own expense in the defense of such action or asserted
liability. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of an action, no
settlement or compromise thereof may be effected (a) by the Indemnifying Party
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the settlement
involves solely money damages and all such relief is paid or satisfied in full
by the Indemnifying Party (subject to the applicable limitations contained
herein) and receives an unconditional release of the applicable Indemnified
Party or (b) by the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unnecessarily withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In no event will an Indemnifying Party be liable for
any settlement effected without its written consent. The terms of this Section
9.6 will also apply to an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section 5.9(j),
Section 5.9(l), Section 5.24 or Section 5.29(c); provided, however, that in
the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 9.6 and
Section 5.9(j), Section 5.9(l), Section 5.24 or Section 5.29(c) then the
provisions of Section 5.9(j), Section 5.9(l), Section 5.24 or Section
5.29(c) (as applicable) will control with respect to the specific matters
contemplated by those respective Sections. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim or any Proceeding resulting therefrom if (i)
the claim is by a customer or supplier of the Indemnified Party, the loss of
the commercial relationship with whom would reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the Indemnified Party, (ii) the claim seeks injunctive
or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party (or any subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Indemnified Party), (iii) the Indemnifying Party has been
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have failed to diligently pursue
such Third Party Claim, (iv) the claim has a reasonable likelihood of
resulting in Losses to the Indemnified Party that would exceed the
Indemnifying Party's exposure under this Agreement in respect of such Third
Party Claim, (v) such Third Party Claim seeks criminal sanctions or penalties,
or (vi) the parties to such claim, action, suit or Proceeding include both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and counsel to the Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that there are legal defenses available
to such Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party.
For the avoidance of doubt, the procedures in this Section 9.6 shall not apply
to Taxes which shall be governed by the procedures in Sections 5.4 through
5.8. \t\t

Tax Indemnity \t\t

 \t\t\t. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE IX,
indemnification with respect to Taxes will be governed solely by Section 5.4,
Section 5.5, Section 5.6, Section 5.7, Section 5.8 and ARTICLE X; provided
that indemnification for Taxes shall be subject to the limitations in Section
9.8(b) and Section 9.8(c). \t\t

Additional Limitations \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (m) \t\t\tExcept for Losses resulting from an action brought by a
third party against a Buyer Indemnified Person or a Seller Indemnified Person,
no Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person will be entitled to
indemnification under ARTICLE IX for punitive damages or for any Losses to the
extent such Losses are not a reasonably foreseeable result of any breach by a
Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE IX to the
contrary, no Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to make any claim under any
provision of this Agreement for reimbursement or indemnification for any
Losses pursuant to this ARTICLE IX or for Taxes to the extent such Losses have
actually been taken into account and fully reimbursed in the adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5 and Section 2.6. In addition, no Party
will be entitled to be compensated more than once for the same Loss. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tNo Party will be entitled to recover any indemnification
payment or other amounts due from the other Party under this Agreement by
retaining and setting off the amounts (whether or not such amounts are
liquidated or reduced to judgment) against any amounts due or to become due
from such Party under this Agreement or under any document delivered pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith, including any Ancillary Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (p) \t\t\tEach Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Losses consistent with applicable Law. Except
pursuant to a written settlement agreed to by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party will not waive or release any contractual right to recover

 \t\t\t\t (q) \t\t\tNo Buyer Indemnified Person will be entitled to
indemnification otherwise available under Section 9.1 with respect to any
Losses arising under Environmental Laws or otherwise with respect to Hazardous
Materials to the extent that they arise as a result of or in connection with
(i) any environmental conditions or Releases discovered or found by post-
Closing testing or sampling, (ii) any Response Action, in each case, unless
such testing, sampling or Response Action (as applicable) is (A) affirmatively
required of a Buyer Indemnified Person by any Environmental Law, Governmental
Authority, Permit (including any renewal, extension or amendment of any
Permit) or Governmental Order, (B) reasonably necessary to defend any
Proceeding against any Buyer Indemnified Person by a third-party or (C)
affirmatively required by any Contract or lease in the form existing as of
Closing, or (iii) any contribution to or exacerbation of a Release after the

results from the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Divested Companies
after Closing) continuing to operate the Business in the ordinary course or in
a materially consistent manner with practices at the relevant site(s) prior to
Closing). In respect of any Response Action which a Buyer Indemnified Person
will be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.1, the Buyer will, to the
extent reasonably practicable, provide the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to review and approve (such approval not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) any such proposed Response Action prior to
implementation and review and approve (such approval not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) final drafts of material documents prepared
for submission to any Governmental Authority prior to submittal and the Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the costs of such
Response Action, including employing cost effective measures to achieve
standards applicable to industrial use (to the extent such measures are
permitted under any Contract, if applicable) including use  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t117  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

of risk based remedies and engineering and institutional controls and deed
restrictions that do not unreasonably prevent any use of the Business Owned
Real Property or Business Leased Real Property as occurring and configured as
of the Closing Date. It shall be presumed that any Almazora Soil or Water
Contamination or Other Soil or Water Contamination existed prior to the
Closing unless the Company can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
contamination by Hazardous Materials occurred or was contributed to or
exacerbated after Closing as a result of actions of the Buyer or the Divested
Companies (other than actions of the Buyer or the Divested Companies after
Closing in connection with the operation of the Business in the ordinary
course or in a materially consistent manner with the practices at the relevant
site(s) prior to Closing).

 \t\t\t\t (r) \t\t\tIn no event will the Buyer Indemnified Person be
entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of for any
Losses to the extent such Losses are for Taxes: (i) arising from any breach
of a representation in Section 3.10 in a Post-Closing Tax Period, other than
the representations in Sections 3.10(h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (m); (ii)
that are due to the unavailability of any net operating losses, or other Tax
attribute from any Pre-Closing Tax Period to offset income earned in any Post-
Closing Tax Period, other than any amounts pursuant to the Spanish Tax Group
Exit Agreement, to which the Exiting Members (as defined therein) are
entitled; or (iii) resulting from transactions or actions taken by the Buyer,
any Divested Company or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing
on the Closing Date that are not contemplated by this Agreement and are
outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 \t\t\t\tArticle X \t\t\tMISCELLANEOUS 

---|--- 

Fees and Expenses \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party will be
liable for and will bear its own expenses and the expenses of its Affiliates
in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the performance and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, whether or not
the Closing will have occurred, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall bear all Transaction Expenses. \t\t

Governing Law \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the substantive
and procedural Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction. The
Parties agree and acknowledge that the survival periods set forth herein, to
the extent expressly longer than the three (3) year survival period permitted
by Title 10, Section 8106(a) of the Delaware Code, are expressly intended to
survive for such longer periods as permitted by Title 10, Section 8106(c) of
the Delaware Code. \t\t

Projections \t\t

 \t\t\t. In connection with the Buyer's investigation of the Divested
Companies, the Sold Assets and the Business, the Buyer or its Affiliates may
have received, or may receive, from the Company, the Sellers, the Divested
Companies and/or  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t118  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

their respective Representatives certain projections and other forecasts for
the Business, and certain business plan and budget information. The Buyer
acknowledges that (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, (b) the Buyer is familiar with
such uncertainties, and (c) the Buyer has made its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and
budgets so furnished to it. Accordingly, the Buyer acknowledges that the
Company and the Sellers make no representation or warranty with respect to
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets.  \t\t

Amendment \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except
upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the
Parties. \t\t

No Assignment \t\t

 \t\t\t. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder will be assigned by any Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party; provided, however, that the Buyer may assign this
Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder (i) to any of its Affiliates
and/or (ii) to any bank or financial institution or other Person (including
any security agent or trustee acting on behalf of any such party or parties or
any hedging counterparties) by way of security for the purposes of, or in
connection with, the financing or refinancing (whether in whole or in part) by
the Buyer of the acquisition of the Shares and the Sold Assets without the
prior written consent of the Company; and provided, further that no such
assignment by the Buyer shall otherwise relieve the Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in
contravention of this Section 10.5 will be void and of no force or effect. No
assignment of any obligations hereunder will relieve the Parties of any such
obligations. In the event that the Company, or its successors or assigns (a)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (b)
transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, the Company shall procure that proper
provision will be made so that the relevant successor and assign of the
Company will be a creditworthy entity (taking into account the Company's
maximum potential liabilities under this Agreement in light of the facts and
circumstances at the time of entering into the transaction) and in the case of
clause (b), will expressly assume the obligations and liabilities of the
Company under this Agreement provided, however, that the transactions
contemplated by clauses (a) and (b) above exclude any merger or consolidation
with an unaffiliated third party which is arms-length in nature or a
transaction (or series of transactions) pursuant to which any Person or
Persons acquire voting control of the Company or substantially all of the
assets of the Company (including by merger, consolidation, stock or asset
purchase, or other similar transaction). The Company shall notify the Buyer as
soon as reasonably practicable of any proposed transaction pursuant to which
this Section 10.5 shall apply and provide any information reasonably requested
by the Buyer with respect to such proposed transaction.  \t\t

Waiver \t\t

 \t\t\t. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement which may be
lawfully waived may be waived in writing at any time by each Party which is
entitled to the  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t119  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement by any
Party will be binding only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such Party. No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement
will be deemed to or will constitute a waiver of such provision and no waiver
of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to or will
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor
will such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. \t\t

Notices \t\t

 \t\t\t. Any notice, demand, or communication required or permitted to be
given by any provision of this Agreement will be deemed to have been

Complete Agreement \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto), the Confidentiality Agreements and the Ancillary Agreements contain
the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except
as expressly set forth therein or as required by applicable Law, the Company
and the Buyer will abstain from, and cause their respective Affiliates to
abstain from, obtaining recourse under local Law under the Ancillary
Agreements. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement will control. \t\t

counterparts may be exchanged by electronic submission, all of which will be
considered one and the same agreement and each of which will be deemed an
original. \t\t

Publicity \t\t

 \t\t\t. The Company and the Buyer will consult with each other and will
mutually agree upon any publication or press release of any nature with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and will not
issue any such publication or press release prior to such consultation and
agreement except as may be required by applicable Law or Governmental Order or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange
or any securities exchange regulation, in which case the Party proposing to

prior to such issuance; provided that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Lone Star Global Acquisitions Ltd., Hudson Advisers, L.P. the Buyer
and any of their respective equityholders or Affiliates that manage or advise

performance or statistical information in connection with fundraising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities to such funds or affiliated
investment vehicles and to the partners, members or other current or potential
investors therein. \t\t

Severability \t\t

 \t\t\t. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability,
without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof in such
jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this Agreement
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible. \t\t

contemplated hereby, including pursuant to Section 5.5, Section 5.9(j),
Section 5.16, Section 5.24, Section 5.29(c), Section 5.31, Section 9.1,

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNo past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
Representative of the Company or its Affiliates will have any Liability for
any obligations or Liabilities of the Company or its Affiliates under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tNo past, present or future director, officer, employee,

obligations or Liabilities of the Buyer or its Affiliates under this Agreement

Jurisdiction \t\t

 \t\t\t. Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of

 \t\t

submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such
proceeding or action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all
claims in respect of the proceeding or action shall be heard and determined
only in any such court and agrees not to bring any proceeding or action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect
the right of any Party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the other Party in any
other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action,
suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 10.14. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing herein shall prohibit a party from enforcing a judgment
received in accordance with this Section 10.14 in a jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware or a court other than the Delaware Chancery Court. \t\t

Specific Performance \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tThe Parties agree that (i) irreparable damage would
occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement or obligations,
undertakings, covenants or agreements of the Parties were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and (ii) money
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy for any such
failure to perform or any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, it is agreed
that each of the Buyer and the Company shall be entitled, at or prior to
Closing, to specific performance (including an injunction or injunctions) to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court specified in
Section 10.14 without proof of damages, this being, subject to Section 8.3, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Without limitation of the foregoing, the Parties hereby further acknowledge
and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company and the Buyer shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants
required to be performed by the other Party under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of the Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing (solely on the
terms and conditions set forth herein), if, and only if: (1) the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, (2) the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, (3)
the Company has confirmed in writing to Buyer that it is ready, willing and
able to effect the Closing, (4) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within
two Business Days after the delivery of such written notice and the Company
stood ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing during such two
Business Day period, and (5) the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) has
been funded to the Buyer (or will reasonably be expected to be funded at the
Closing) if the Equity Financing is funded to the Buyer (or will reasonably be
expected to be funded at the Closing substantially simultaneously with the
funding of the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing) on the terms of
the Equity Commitment Letter; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, in no event will a Buyer Termination Fee or any monetary damages for
Willful Breach be payable if specific performance of the Buyer's obligation to
consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement is granted.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tEach Party agrees that it will not oppose (and hereby
waives any defense in any action for) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(i) the other Party have an adequate remedy at Law or (ii) an award of
specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at Law, equity or otherwise. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement when available pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tIf the Company brings an action for specific performance
pursuant to this Section 10.15, and a court expressly rules that the Buyer
breached this Agreement in connection with its failure to effect the Closing
in accordance with this Agreement such that Company would be entitled to the
Buyer Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(a), that the Company did
not breach this Agreement, and that the Company has the right to seek specific
performance under this Agreement to cause the Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, but such court declines to enforce
specifically the obligations of the Buyer to effect the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement, then, in addition to the right of the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company shall be
entitled to payment of the Buyer Termination Fee payable hereunder in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the exercise of the Company's right to seek specific performance
pursuant to this Section 10.15 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the
Company's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 or to
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in accordance with the terms hereof;
provided, that, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance to require Buyer to consummate the Closing and
the payment of any Buyer Termination Fee.

Waiver of Jury Trial \t\t

 \t\t\t. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTIES MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUIT OR
ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
EACH PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT IT WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS
WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. FURTHER, EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE OTHER
PARTY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. \t\t

Attorney‑Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver \t\t

 \t\t\t. Jones Day and other law firms have represented one or more of the
Company, the Sellers and the Divested Companies. The Parties recognize the
commonality of interest that exists and will continue to exist until Closing,
and the Parties agree that such commonality of interest should continue to be
recognized after the Closing. Specifically, the Parties agree that (a) the
Buyer will not, and will not cause the Divested Companies to, seek to have

Sellers in connection with any dispute that may arise between the Company and
the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer and the Divested Companies (after
the Closing), on the other hand, in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) in connection with any dispute that
may arise between the Company and/or the Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Buyer and/or the Divested Companies (after the Closing), on the other hand,
the Company and the Sellers (and not the Buyer or the Divested Companies) will
have the right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney‑client privilege
that may apply to any communications between the Divested Companies and Jones
Day or such other law firms relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby that occurred before the Closing. \t\t

Survival \t\t

 \t\t\t. Each covenant and agreement that explicitly contemplates
performance after the Closing, will, in each case and to such extent,
expressly survive the Closing in accordance with its terms as expressly
specified herein, then for twenty (20) years following the Closing Date, and
nothing in this Section 10.18 will be deemed to limit any rights or remedies
of any Person for breach of any such surviving covenant or agreement. \t\t

Financing Matters \t\t

 \t\t\t. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of
the Parties on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and each of its controlled
Affiliates hereby: \t\t

contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court
(or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be unavailable, any other court of
the State of Delaware or the courts of appeal therein), and each of the
Parties irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court;
