Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:   (i) Conversion Generally.   (A) Each share of
Company Common Stock issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other  than any shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled  pursuant to ss.4(a)(ii) and any shares of Company Common  Stock
which are held by Stockholders exercising appraisal  rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting  Stockholders")), shall be converted,
subject to ss.4(a)(iv),  into the right to receive the Per Share Purchase
Price in  cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest, and 
subject to ss.4(c) and ss.12(k) (the "Merger  Consideration"). All such
shares of Company Common Stock  shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be  canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each 
certificate previously representing any such shares shall  thereafter
represent the right to receive the Merger  Consideration therefor or the
right, if any, to receive  payment from the Surviving Corporation of the
"fair value"  of such shares of Company Common Stock as determined in 
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Certificates    12   
previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall  be exchanged
for the Merger Consideration upon the surrender  of such certificates in
accordance with the provisions of  ss.3(b), without interest. The "Per Share
Purchase Price"  shall equal the quotient of (i) the Aggregate Amount
divided  by(ii) the sum of (A) the number of outstanding shares of  Company
Common Stock as of immediately prior to the  Effective Time and (B) the
aggregate number of shares of  Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Company Options  whether vested or unvested that are In the Money and 
outstanding immediately prior to cancellation in accordance  with ss.3(e).
The "Aggregate Amount" shall equal  $550,300,000 (A) plus the Aggregate
Exercise Price, (B) plus  the Aggregate Exercise Proceeds, (C) minus the
Excess  Expenses (as defined in ss.12(k)) and (D) minus the  aggregate
amount paid by the Company or any Subsidiary of  the Company to redeem or
repurchase any Company Common Stock  or Company Options, (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt,  the transactions contemplated by ss.3(e)) between the
date  hereof and the Effective Time ("Repurchase Payments"). A  Company
Option is "In the Money" for purposes hereof if the  exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock issuable  upon exercise of such Company Option is
less than the Per  Share Purchase Price. The "Aggregate Exercise Price"
means  the aggregate exercise price of all Company Options that are  In the
Money and outstanding immediately prior to  cancellation in accordance with
ss.3(e). The "Aggregate  Exercise Proceeds" means the aggregate cash
proceeds  received by the Company from the exercise of Company Options 
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement  and ending on the
Effective Time, excluding any cash  proceeds from the exercise of Company
Options by the persons  listed on ss.3 of the Company Disclosure

shall pay to the Escrow Agent (as  defined in ss.4(c)), for deposit into the
Escrow Fund and  the Representative Expense Fund, respectively, on behalf
of  each holder of shares of Company Common Stock, a portion of  the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable in respect of  such Company Common Stock
equal to the Escrow Per Share  Amount and the Expense Fund Per Share Amount
(as defined  below), respectively, for each share of Company Common  Stock,
which in each case shall be held by the Escrow Agent  as nominee for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock  converted pursuant to ss.3(a). The
"Escrow Per Share Amount"  shall be equal to the quotient of (x) the Escrow
Amount (as  defined below) less the Total Option Escrow Amount (as  defined
in ss.3(e)) divided by (y) the aggregate number of  shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding as of the Closing  Date. The "Expense Fund Per Share
Amount" shall be equal to  the quotient of (x), the Representative Expense
Amount less  the Total Option Expense Fund Amount, divided by (y) the 
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock  outstanding as of the
Closing Date. The "Escrow Amount"    13    shall be $25,000,000. The
"Representative Expense Amount"  shall be $500,000 for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the  Stockholders\' Representative in such capacity, and shall
be  increased from time to time by the amount of any interest,  dividends,
earnings and other income on such amount.   (ii) Cancellation of Certain
Shares. Each share of  Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any
wholly  owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of  the
Company or by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company  immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled and  extinguished without any
conversion thereof and no payment  shall be made with respect thereto.  
(iii) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par  value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted  into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully  paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving 
Corporation.   (iv) Change in Shares. If, between the date of this 
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of  Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different  number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock  dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization,  split, combination or exchange of
shares, the Merger  Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted, if 
appropriate, to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,  reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or  exchange of shares.   (b) Exchange
of Certificates.   (i) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent 
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying  agent
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent (the  "Paying Agent"), for
the benefit of the holders of shares of  Company Common Stock, for exchange
in accordance with ss.2 and  this ss.3, through the Paying Agent, cash in
U.S. dollars in  an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Stock Sale
Purchase  Price as provided herein payable pursuant to ss.2(a) and the 
aggregate Merger Consideration as provided herein payable  pursuant to
ss.3(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of  Company Common Stock less, in
each case, the amount to be  deposited with the Escrow Agent into the Escrow
Account and  Representative Expense Fund (such cash being hereinafter 
referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall,  pursuant to
irrevocable instructions from Parent  given at the Effective Time, deliver
the aggregate Stock Sale  Purchase Price contemplated to be paid pursuant to
ss.2(a) and  the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid 
pursuant to ss.3(a) out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund  shall not be
used for any other purpose. Any interest earned  on the Payment Fund shall be
for the account of and paid to  the Parent.    14    (ii) Exchange
Procedures. (A) At the Effective Time,  Parent shall instruct the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder  of record of a certificate or certificates
which immediately  prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of  Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (x) a letter of  transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall  pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the  Paying Agent and shall be in customary form) and (y) 
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the  Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration,  including instructions for providing
a FIRPTA Certificate;  provided that the Company and Parent will, and will
cause the  Paying Agent to, make such letter of transmittal and 
instructions available at the Effective Time at the premises  of the Company
or such other location as the Company shall  determine and facilitate the
payment of Merger Consideration  at the Effective Time to any holder of a
Certificate or  Certificates who is prepared as of that date to surrender
its  Certificates and deliver such documents. Upon surrender of a 
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with  such letter
of transmittal, properly completed and duly  executed, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant  to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be  entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger  Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in  respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly  represented by such
Certificate (less the amount, if any, of  the applicable Merger Consideration
to be deposited in the  Escrow Fund and Representative Expense Fund pursuant
to ss.4),  after giving effect to any required withholdings, and the 
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No  interest will be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration  payable to holders of
Certificates. In the event of a transfer  of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock which is not  registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger  Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate 
representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented  to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to  evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any  applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until  surrendered as contemplated by this ss.3(b), each Certificate 
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to  represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the  Merger Consideration.   (B) At
the Stock Purchase Closing, Parent shall  instruct the Paying Agent to
deliver the Stock Sale Purchase  Price to the Sellers pursuant to ss.4(a)
(less the amount,  if any, of the applicable Stock Sale Purchase Price to
be  deposited in the Escrow Fund and Representative Expense Fund  pursuant
to ss.4). No interest will be paid or accrued on  any Stock Sale Purchase
Price.   (iii) Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All  Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof  shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of  all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock.  At and after the Effective Time, the holder
of a Certificate    15    (except Merger Sub) or of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to  have any rights as a holder of Company Common Stock, except 
for, in the case of a holder of a Certificate or a holder of  Dissenting
Shares to whom the penultimate sentence of ss.3(c)  applies, the right to
surrender Certificates in the manner  prescribed by ss.3(b)(ii) in exchange
for payment of the  Merger Consideration, and in the case of a Dissenting 
Stockholder, the right to perfect the right to receive payment  for his or
her Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of  the DGCL.   (iv)
Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the  Payment Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of  Company Common Stock for 18 months after the
Effective Time  shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders
of  Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with  this ss.3
shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger  Consideration, without
any interest thereon.   (v) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Company
shall  be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for  any
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official  pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (vi) Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have  been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an  affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate  to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,  the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable  amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim  that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate,  the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen 
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any  interest
thereon.   (vii) Withholding. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be  entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration  otherwise payable
pursuant to ss.3(b) to any holder of  Certificates such amounts as Parent or
the Paying Agent are  required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any  provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to  the
making of such payment; provided, however, that no amount  shall be deducted
or withheld under Section 1445 of the Code  withrespect to a holder who has
provided a FIRPTA Certificate.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or the  Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all 
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder  of Company
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and  withholding was made by
Parent or the Paying Agent.   c) Dissenters\' Rights. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder
shall demand to be paid the "fair value" of such holder\'s shares of Company
Common Stock, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration except as provided in this ss.3(c),
and the Company shall give Parent notice thereof and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any
Dissenting Stockholder    16    shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the shares of Company
Common Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be treated
as though such shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to ss.3(a). Parent shall contribute or cause to be contributed to
the Surviving Corporation funds sufficient from time to time to make all
payments with respect to the Dissenting Shares.   (d) Stock Transfer Books.
At the close of business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except
as otherwise provided herein or by law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be
converted into the Merger Consideration.   (e) Stock Options.   (i) Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall  take all reasonable actions
necessary and appropriate to  provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each  unexpired and unexercised option to purchase Company
Common  Stock (the "Company Options") under any stock option plan of  the
Company, including the 1997 Stock Purchase and Option Plan  for Key Employees
of KinderCare Learning Centers, Inc. and  Subsidiaries, the 2002 Stock
Purchase and Option Plan for Key  California Employees of KinderCare Learning
Centers, Inc. and  Subsidiaries (the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether
or  not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in  exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled  Company Option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration  of the cancellation of such Company
Option and in settlement  therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any
applicable  withholding taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld)  of
an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of  shares of Company
Common Stock previously subject to such  Company Option and (B) the excess,
if any, of the Per Share  Purchase Price over the exercise price per share of
Company  Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option (such 
amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the "Option  Payment"). From
and after the Effective Time, any such  cancelled Company Option shall no
longer be exercisable by the  former holder thereof, but shall only entitle
such holder to  the payment of the Option Payment. Subject to the
immediately  following paragraph, all Option Payments shall be made by the 
Company at the Effective Time.   (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the
Effective  Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of 
ss.ss.4 and 10, Parent shall pay to the Escrow Agent, for  deposit into the
Escrow Fund and the Representative Expense  Fund, respectively, on behalf of
each holder of In the Money  Company Options, a portion of the Option Payment
otherwise  payable in respect of such Company Options equal to (x) the 
quotient of the Option Escrow Amount in respect of such    17    
Company Options divided by the total number of shares of  Company Common
Stock underlying In the Money Company Options  as of the Closing Date and (y)
the quotient of the Option  Expense Fund Amount in respect of such Company
Options divided  by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock 
underlying In the Money Options as of the Closing Date,  respectively, which
in each case shall be held by the Escrow  Agent as nominee for holders of In
the Money Company Options  converted pursuant to this Section ss.3(e). In
respect of any  Company Options, (i) the "Option Escrow Amount" shall be
the  product of (x) the Escrow Amount multiplied by, (y) the  quotient of
(a) the Option Payment, divided by (b) the sum of  $550,300,000, plus the
Aggregate Exercise Proceeds, less the  aggregate Repurchase Payments and less
Excess Expenses (with  the "Total Option Escrow Amount" being the total of
all Option  Escrow Amounts) and (ii) the "Option Expense Fund Amount"  shall
be the product of (x) the Representative Expense Amount  multiplied by, (y)
the quotient of (a) the Option Payment,  divided by (b) the sum of
$550,300,000, plus the Aggregate  Exercise Proceeds, less the aggregate
Repurchase Payments and  less Excess Expenses (with the "Total Option Expense
Fund  Amount" being the total of all Option Expense Fund Amounts).   4.

action and to do  all things necessary, proper, or advisable in order to 
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement (including satisfaction, but not waiver, of the  closing conditions
set forth in ss.9 below).   (ii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees
to  have available all the funds necessary to pay all amounts  payable
pursuant to ss.ss.2 and 4 and to pay all fees and  expenses and other amounts
payable by Parent and Merger Sub  related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (iii) If any claim, action, suit, investigation or  other
proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other Person  is commenced which
questions the validity or legality of any  of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or  seeks damages in connection therewith, the
Parties agree to  cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend
against  such claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding  and,
if an injunction or other order is issued in any such    44    action,
suit or other proceeding, to use reasonable best  efforts to have such
injunction or other order lifted, and to  cooperate reasonably regarding any
other impediment to the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.   (iv) The Company agrees, at Parent\'s risk and expense 
and without any undue burden on the Company\'s operations, to  provide
reasonable assistance to Parent in connection with its  arrangement of bank
financing from a syndicate of commercial  lenders and obtaining of ratings
from rating agencies, but  without any requirement to execute any instruments
or  agreements, deliver any certificates or opinions or otherwise  make any
binding commitment (other than instruments,  agreements and commitments that
are not effective until the  Closing) and subject to appropriate
confidentiality  restrictions. The Company further agrees, at Parent\'s risk
and  expense and without any undue burden on the Company\'s  operations, to
provide reasonable cooperation to Parent in  order to make arrangements
satisfactory to the trustee to  facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of
the Company\'s  9-1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "Notes")
issued  under the Indenture dated as of February 13, 1997 between the 
Company and Marine Midland Bank, as trustee (the "Indenture")  pursuant to
the terms of Section 401 of the Indenture or the  defeasance of the Notes
pursuant to Article 12 of the  Indenture or to otherwise repurchase the Notes
in a manner  reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company; provided that 
(i) Parent shall have funded the deposit required by Section  401 or Article
12 of the Indenture or irrevocably provided  funds to otherwise repurchase
the Notes prior to the Company  taking any irrevocable steps, (ii) Parent
shall use its  reasonable best efforts to cause Section 401(b)(iii) of the

notice of redemption of the Notes is given after  the Closing, (iii) if for
any reason the Closing does not  happen and the Company becomes obligated to
repurchase or  redeem the Notes prior to maturity, then the funds deposited 
by Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) shall be used  for the
redemption or repurchase of the Notes and such funds  shall be deemed a loan
to the Company (such loan to be on  terms to be mutually agreed between the
Company and Parent and  substantially similar to, but no less favorable to
the Company  than, those of the Notes), and (iv) Parent shall provide, and 
be responsible for, all opinions, certificates and other  documents, monies
and other undertakings necessary to  accomplish such satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance. The  parties acknowledge and agree that the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
conditioned  on Parent or any of its Affiliates obtaining any financing, 
that the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(a)(iv) are an  accommodation
by the Company of Parent and that the  arrangement of financing and the
satisfaction and discharge or  defeasance or other repurchase of the Notes as
aforesaid shall  not prevent, delay or hinder the Closing. The Company makes
no  representation or warranty that such financing can be obtained  or that
such satisfaction and discharge or defeasance or other  repurchase can be
accomplished and the failure to obtain any  such financing or accomplish such
satisfaction and discharge     45    or defeasance or other repurchase
shall not excuse performance  by Parent and Merger Sub of any provision of
this Agreement.   (b) Notices and Consents.   (i) For the period between
the execution of this  Agreement and the Effective Time, the Parent and the
Company  agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause  to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all  things necessary to
consummate and make effective the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all of  the following: (A) timely seeking to obtain

reasonably  request in order to prepare filings or submissions under the 
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Each of the Company and Parent agrees  (A) to keep the

communication by such party to any  Governmental Authority and (C) to
cooperate and coordinate  with each other in connection with resolving any
investigation  or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement commenced by either such agencies to cause the  waiting
periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to terminate  or expire at the
earliest possible date after the date of  filing; provided that neither the
Company nor Parent shall be  required to continue to pursue approval to the
extent either  agency or staff of either agency has indicated, in the  good-
faith belief of both the Company\'s and Parent\'s legal  counsel, that it
will invoke judicial process to enjoin    46    consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement prior to the expiration of the
waiting period.   (iii) As promptly as practicable, and in any event not 
more than 10 Business Days after the date hereof, the Company  shal`l notify
all childcare licensing agencies having  jurisdiction over the business of
the Company or its  Subsidiaries of this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby and shall thereafter use reasonable best  efforts to
obtain all consents, authorizations, approvals,  qualifications and orders
necessary to allow the business of  the Company and its Subsidiaries to
continue uninterrupted, in  good standing and without restriction following
the Effective  Time consistent with its current status.   (iv) The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use  their reasonable best efforts to obtain the

to establish any special monitoring effort or take other actions outside of
the Ordinary Course of Business to comply with this provision. Parent and
Merger Sub shall use reasonable efforts to give prompt written notice to the
Company of any development of which Parent or Merger Sub has knowledge and
which would reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of any of
the representations and warranties in ss.5. No notice provided pursuant to
this ss.8(f) shall have any effect for purposes of determining the existence
of, or any liability for, breach of representation or warranty, either prior
to or after the Closing, and shall not be, and no party shall claim that such
notice constitutes, an admission or evidence that any information contained
therein constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty contained
herein. This covenant is for information purposes only.   (g)

certain Confidentiality Agreement dated as of August 6, 2004 between
Knowledge Learning Corporation and the Company (the "Confidentiality

respective Representatives) shall be held bound by the Confidentiality
Agreement to the same extent as if Parent and Merger Sub were Knowledge
Learning Corporation.   (h) Section 16 Approval. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of

interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or
director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes
of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder ("Section 16") of shares of Company Common Stock or options to
acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall
be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.     50    (i)
Exclusivity.   (i) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the  date
upon which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to ss.11  hereof, the
Company shall not, and shall not cause or permit  any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their directors, officers or  employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor,  attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
them  to, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly 
encourage the submission of any Purchase Proposal or (B)  participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding,  furnish any information with respect
to, assist or participate  in, or knowingly facilitate in any other manner
any effort,  inquiries or attempt by any Person to make or seek any 
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to  lead to, a
Purchase Proposal. Until the earlier of the  Effective Time and the date upon
which this Agreement is  terminated, none of the Sellers shall vote their
Company  Common Stock in favor of or participate in any Purchase  Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, any of  its Subsidiaries or any
officer, director or employee of, or  any investment banker, attorney or
other advisor or  representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or  representatives may, following receipt of a Purchase Proposal  or any
request for information or inquiry relating to any  Purchase Proposal which
did not result from any breach of  ss.8(i)(i) and which could reasonably be
expected to lead to a  Superior Proposal, furnish information, pursuant to
a  customary confidentiality agreement (the terms of which are 
substantially similar to and no less favorable to the Company  than the
Confidentiality Agreement), and participate in  discussions or negotiations
regarding such Purchase Proposal;  provided, that the Company may take such
actions only if the  Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith,  after consultation with outside counsel, that it is necessary  to do
so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the  Company\'s
stockholders under applicable law. As promptly as  practicable, but in any
event within one Business Day, after  any officer or director of the Company
receives or has  knowledge of any Purchase Proposal, the Company shall
provide  Parent with (A) oral and written notice of the material terms  and
conditions of such Purchase Proposal and the identity of  the Person or group
making any such Purchase Proposal, (B) a  copy of all written materials
provided by the Company in  connection with such Purchase Proposal, and (C) a
written  summary of any such Purchase Proposal, if it is not in  writing.
After receipt of such Purchase Proposal, the Company  shall continue to
promptly keep Parent informed in all  material respects of the status and
details of any such  Purchase Proposal, including any changes in price,
structure,  form of consideration or closing conditions.   (ii) Neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor  any committee thereof shall (A)
withdraw or modify (in a  manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) or publicly
propose to  withdraw or modify (in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger 
Sub) the approval by such Board of Directors of this Agreement  or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) approve or  recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any  Purchase Proposal or (C) enter into any
agreement with respect  to any Purchase Proposal, unless the Company receives
a   51    Superior Proposal that resulted from an unsolicited Purchase 
Proposal which did not result from any breach of ss.8(i)(i)  and the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good  faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that in order  to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s  Stockholders under applicable law it is necessary for the  Board
of Directors of the Company to withdraw or modify its  approval of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby, approve such Superior
Proposal or enter into an  agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
provided  that, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any 
committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or publicly  propose to withdraw
or modify, its approval of this Agreement  or the transactions contemplated
hereby, approve or recommend,  or publicly propose to approve or recommend,
such Superior  Proposal or enter into an agreement with respect to such 
Superior Proposal for a period of not less than three Business  Days after
Parent\'s receipt of notice of such Superior  Proposal pursuant to ss.8(i)(i)
above; provided further, that  during such three Business Day-period, the
Company shall, if  requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent
to  revise or amend this Agreement so that the Purchase Proposal  that
constituted a Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a  Superior
Proposal.   (iii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this  Agreement to
the contrary, any action by the Board of  Directors of the Company permitted
by this ss.8(i) shall not  constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company. Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or
its  board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule  14e-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  with respect to a Purchase
Proposal.   (j) Restrictive Covenants. For a period of six months from and
after the Effective Time, Individual shall not solicit or take any
steps specifically intended to induce any person who is then an employee of
any of the Company or its Subsidiaries in a management, supervisory or
senior operational position (which includes, without limitation, area
managers and center directors), to leave his or her employment to become an
employee of Individual, Individual\'s employer or of any Person which has
engaged Individual to represent it; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall apply to any employee (i) who ceases to be employed by the relevant
employer entity prior to any such solicitation or steps, (ii) who contacts
Individual or such employer or Person represented by Individual on his or her
own initiative without any solicitation from Individual, (iii) who approaches
Individual or such employer or Person represented by Individual in response
to any broad-based solicitation of employment in publications or
through advertisements or (iv) who is presented to Individual or such
employer or Person represented by Individual by a placement agency or other
similar business, so long as such agency has not been directed by Individual
or such employer or Person represented by Individual to solicit or approach
such employee. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this ss.8(j) is invalid or
unenforceable, Individual and Parent agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision,   52   and this ss.8(j) shall be enforceable as so
modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed.   (k) Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance.  
(i) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect  in the Surviving
Corporation\'s (or any successor\'s)  certificate of incorporation and by-
laws provisions identical  with respect to elimination of personal
liability,  indemnification and advancement of expenses (provided that,  the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an  undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately  determined that such Person is not entitled
to  indemnification), which provisions shall not be amended,  repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would  adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the individuals who  at or prior to the Effective Time were
directors, officers,  agents or employees of the Company as those contained
in the  Company\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws as in  effect on
the date of this Agreement. To the extent, if any,  not provided by an
existing right of indemnification or other  agreement or policy, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify, defend and  hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable  Law, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to 
the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,  an officer or
director of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (each, for purposes of
this ss.8(k) only, an  "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified  Parties") against (A) all losses, expenses (including 
reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses), claims, damages or  liabilities
or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding  sentence, amounts paid in
settlement, arising out of actions  or omissions ("Actions") occurring at or
prior to the  Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at 
or after the Effective Time) that are, in whole or in part,  based on or
arising out of the fact that such person is or was  a director or officer of
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (for purposes of this ss.8(k) only,
the  "Indemnified DandO; Liabilities"), and (B) all Indemnified DandO; 
Liabilities to the extent they are based in whole or in part  on or arise in
whole or in part out of or pertain to this  Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In the  event of any Action, the Surviving Corporation
shall control  the defense of such Action with counsel selected by the 
Surviving Corporation, which counsel shall be reasonably  acceptable to the
Indemnified Party; provided however, that  the Indemnified Party shall be
permitted to participate in the  defense of such Action through counsel
selected by the  Indemnified Party at the Indemnified Party\'s expense. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any conflict  between the
Surviving Corporation and any Indemnified Parties  or there are additional
defenses available to any Indemnified  Parties which are not available to the
other defendants, the  Indemnified Parties shall be permitted to participate
in the  defense of such Action with counsel selected by the  Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably  acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation, and Parent shall  cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the
reasonable fees and  expenses of such counsel; provided however, that the
Surviving  Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees 
and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified  Parties in any
single Action except to the extent that, in the   53    opinion of
counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more of  such Indemnified Parties
have conflicting interests in the  outcome of such Action. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall  be liable for any settlement effected without its prior 
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld) and that
a condition to the indemnification payments  provided in ss.8(k)(i) shall be
that such defendant not have  settled any Action without the consent of
Parent. Neither  Parent nor the Company shall have any obligation hereunder
to  any such defendant when and if a court of competent  jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such  determination shall have become final and
non-appealable, that  indemnification of such defendant in the manner
contemplated  hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Upon the Effective 
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for all of  its
obligations under the existing indemnification agreements  with each of the
directors and officers of the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries.   (ii)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to  maintain in effect for six
years from the Effective Time  policies (or "tail" policies) of directors\'
and officers\'  liability insurance containing terms and conditions which
are  not less advantageous than those policies maintained by the  Company at
the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring  at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent available,  and having the maximum available
coverage under the current  policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance;  provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required 
to spend in excess of 200% of the current annual premium  therefor (such 200%
amount, the "Maximum Premium"); and  provided, further, that if the Surviving
Corporation would be  required to spend in excess of the Maximum Premium per
annum  to obtain insurance having the maximum available coverage  under the
current policies, the Surviving Corporation will be  required to or procure
as much insurance coverage as it is  able to obtain for a premium equal to
the Maximum Premium.   (iii) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (A) 
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall  not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of  such consolidation or
merger or (B) transfers all or  substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person,  then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made  so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or 
transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume  the obligations
of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this  ss.8(k).   (iv) The
covenants contained in this ss.8(k) shall  survive the Effective Time until
fully discharged and are  intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by,  each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her 
representatives.   (l) Certain Labor Matters.   (i) WARN. Parent shall
not, at any time prior to 90  days after the Closing Date, effectuate a
"plant closing" or   54    "mass layoff", as those terms are defined in
WARN, affecting  in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, 
operating unit or employee of the Surviving Corporation,  without complying
with the notice requirements and other  provisions of WARN. The Parent shall
provide a full defense  to, and indemnify the Stockholders for any loss,
liability,  claim, damage or expense (including attorney\'s fees and other 
costs of defense) which the Stockholders may incur in  connection with, any
suit or claim of violation brought  against the Surviving Corporation under
WARN for any actions  taken by the Parent with regard to any site of
employment,  facility, operating unit or employee affected by this 
Agreement on or after the Closing Date. At the Closing, the  Company shall
deliver a complete and accurate list of  full-time employees that have
experienced an employment loss  in the 90-day period prior to the Closing
Date from any site  of employment of the Company or its Subsidiaries that
employed  fifty or more individuals at the time of such employment loss.  
(ii) COBRA. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall  be liable for all
notices (or lack thereof) and benefits (or  lack thereof) required to be
provided to Company employees  under COBRA on or after the Effective Time and
shall be  responsible for all liabilities and obligations with respect  to
the provision of any notice and benefits (or lack thereof)  to any Company
employees that arise under COBRA on or after  the Effective Time. Further,
Parent shall, and shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to, provide any
required notices and  benefits, and to indemnify and hold harmless the
Stockholders  from any liability, under COBRA and any other related 
applicable laws that may arise with respect to any "qualifying  event" (as
defined by COBRA) of any Company employee that  occurs due to the actions or
failure to act of Parent or the  Surviving Corporation on or after the
Effective Time.   (m) Severance Benefits. To the extent severance
benefits arise as a result of the Merger (whether alone or in connection with
any subsequent events(s)) under (i) any severance arrangements in effect
prior to the Effective Time (including the Headquarters Severance Plan
approved by the Company\'s Board of Directors on March 10, 2004, including
modifications approved on or about October 21, 2004 and November 5, 2004 (the
"Headquarters Plan"), (ii) any severance agreements between the Company and
each of the officers and senior directors of the Company approved by the
Company\'s Board of Directors on March 10, 2004, including modifications
approved on or about October 21, 2004 and November 5, 2004 (the "Severance
Agreements") or (iii) the severance policy generally applicable to employees
of the Company and providing up to a maximum of four weeks of severance
(except in the case of certain field operating management and corporate
office personnel whose severance is based on length of service pursuant to
such policy), as set forth in the Company\'s Employee Benefits Manuals (the
"Severance Policy"), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor
such plans with respect to such benefits, as applicable, for each employee of
the Company that is employed with the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
from the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
maintain a severance pay practice, program or arrangement for the benefit of
each employee of the Company that is no less favorable than the Severance
Policy with respect to such employee.    55    (n) Employee
Benefits.   (i) From the Effective Time until the one year  anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or  cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, compensation  levels and employee benefits under plans, programs
and  arrangements which, in the aggregate, will provide  compensation and
benefits to employees of the Company which  are substantially comparable to
those provided pursuant to the  plans, programs and arrangements of the
Company as of the  Effective Time (excluding the Company\'s stock option
and  deferred compensation plans); provided that this covenant  shall not
require Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving  Corporation to continue in
effect any particular Company  Benefit Plan.   (ii) With respect to any
welfare benefit plans  maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries for the
benefit of  employees of the Company on and after the Effective Time, 
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)  cause there
to be waived any eligibility requirements or  pre-existing condition
limitations to the extent such  eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations  were waived by the applicable plans of the Company,
and (ii)  give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum  out-of-
pocket limitations, amounts paid by such employees with  respect to
comparable Company Plans. Parent shall, or shall  cause the Surviving
Corporation to, give employees of the  Company full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting  and benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual
under a  defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans  or
arrangements maintained by the Parent or its Subsidiaries  in which such
employees participate for such employees\'  service with the Company or its
affiliates or predecessors, to  the same extent recognized by the Company
under comparable  Company Plans.   (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall  be entitled to, in its discretion, give irrevocable 
instructions to the trustee of the grantor trust established  to fund the
benefits under the Company\'s nonqualified deferred  compensation plan to pay
on the Closing Date the full account  balance of each participant in such
plan. Parent shall not,  and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, take
any action  to revoke, alter or delay such instructions or payment.   (iv)
With respect to any annual bonus of any employee  of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year in  which the Closing occurs, in determining
the Company\'s  performance components based on actual EBITDA or net income
of  the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, if applicable, compared  to planned
EBITDA or net income, the Company shall use its  best efforts to determine
such components on a basis  equivalent to the manner that such components
would have been  determined if the Closing had not occurred, which 
determination will include, without limitation, the exclusion  of all costs
and expenses (including legal and accounting fees  and expenses) incurred in
connection with (A) this Agreement  and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (B) the  preparation and filing of, and transactions contemplated by, 
that certain Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration    56   
No. 333-114693) filed with the SEC on April 21, 2004, as  amended to date,
and that certain Registration Statement on  Form S-4 (Registration No.
333-114701) filed with the SEC on  April 22, 2004, as amended to date.   9.

specific period of time which shall be true and correct in all  material

each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have  performed and complied with all of

(a) Bring down and Survival of Representations and Warranties. If the Closing
occurs, (i) Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent
and warrant that all of the representations and warranties made by them in
ss.5 hereof are true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing
Date, as though made on the Closing Date, unless such representations and
warranties are made only as of another date, in which case they shall be true
and correct in all material respects as of such date, (ii) each of the
Sellers hereby severally represents and warrants solely as to   
59   itself or himself (as the case may be) that all of the representations
and warranties made by it or him in ss.6 hereof are true and correct in
all material respects as of the Closing Date, except as set forth in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or in the Company SEC Filings filed prior to the
date hereof, as though made on the Closing Date, unless such representations
and warranties are made only as of another date, in which case they shall be
true and correct in all material respects as of such date and (iii) the
Company represents and warrants that all of the representations and
warranties made by it in ss.7 hereof are true and correct in all material
respects as of the Closing Date, except as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in the Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date
hereof, as though made on the Closing Date, unless such representations and
warranties are made only as of another date, in which case they shall be true
and correct in all material respects as of such date. All of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in ss.5
above, all of the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in
ss.6 above and all of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in ss.7 above shall survive the Effective Time hereunder and
continue in full force and effect for a period of one (1) year
thereafter.   (b) Indemnification Provisions.   (i) In the event any of
the Company or the Sellers  breaches any of their:   (A) representations
and warranties contained herein  (without regard to any limitation,
qualification or exception  based upon any use of the word "material" or
derivations  thereof in any representation or warranty herein, which shall 
be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a breach of  such
representation or warranty has occurred and the amount of  Adverse
Consequences resulting therefrom; provided, however,  that the word
"material" and derivations thereof in the  representations and warranties
contained in ss.7(h), ss.7(i)  and the first sentence of ss.7(j) shall not be
disregarded for  such purposes) and provided that Parent makes a written
claim  for indemnification against the Stockholders pursuant to  ss.12(g)
below within the survival period for such  representation and warranty
pursuant to ss.10(a) above; or   (B) covenants contained herein,   then,
subject to the provisions of this ss.10, each of the  Stockholders (each, a
"Stockholder Indemnifying Party" or,  collectively, the "Stockholder
Indemnifying Parties") agrees,  jointly and severally, to indemnify Parent,
Affiliates of  Parent (including Merger Sub and after the Effective Time,
the  Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and each of their 
respective officers, directors, agents or employees, and their  respective
successors and assigns (each a "Parent Indemnified  Party," or, collectively,
the "Parent Indemnified Parties")  from and against any Adverse Consequences
a Parent Indemnified  Party actually suffers resulting from, arising out of,
or  caused by such breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the 
Stockholder Indemnifying Parties shall not have any obligation  to indemnify
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this  ss.10(b)(i) until the Parent
Indemnified Parties have suffered  Adverse Consequences by reason of all such
breaches in excess  of $3,000,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), after which,
subject  to the other provisions of this ss.10, the Stockholder 
Indemnifying Parties shall be obligated to indemnify the Parent    60   
Indemnified Parties from and against the amount of any excess  Adverse
Consequences above the Deductible Amount solely from  the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow  Agreement, (B) no Adverse
Consequence may be claimed under  ss.10(b)(i)(A) by the Parent Indemnified
Parties or shall be  indemnified against by the Stockholder Indemnifying
Parties or  the Sellers or shall be included in determining the aggregate 
Adverse Consequences set forth in clause (A) above, unless the  Adverse
Consequences suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties  resulting from,
arising out of, or caused by, any single or  aggregated claims arising out of
the same set of facts, events  or circumstances, exceeds $20,000 (the "De
Minimis Claim  Size"), (C) there will be an aggregate ceiling equal to the 
amount of funds in the Escrow Account from time to time on the  obligation of
the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties to indemnify  the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this ss.10(b)(i) and  ss.9(a)(iv), and (D) the right of
the Parent Indemnified  Parties to seek indemnification under ss.10(b)(i)
shall be  limited to and capped at the Escrow Amount (as increased by any 
net profit from, or interest or income produced by, Permitted  Investments in
the Escrow Fund) and such monies as are on  deposit in the Escrow Fund shall
be the sole and exclusive  source from which indemnification obligations of
the  Stockholders to any Parent Indemnified Party under this  ss.10(b)(i)
may be satisfied.   (ii) In the event any of the Parent or Merger Sub 
breaches any of their:   (A) representations and warranties contained
herein  (without regard to any limitation, qualification or exception  based
upon any use of the word "material" or derivations  thereof in any
representation and warranty herein, which shall  be disregarded for purposes
of determining whether a breach has  occurred and the amount of Adverse
Consequences resulting  therefrom) and provided that the Stockholders\'
Representative  makes a written claim for indemnification against Parent or 
Merger Sub, as the case may be, pursuant to ss.12(g) below  within the
survival period for such representations and  warranty pursuant to ss.10(a)
above; or   (B) covenants contained herein,   then, subject to the
provisions of this ss.10, Parent and  Merger Sub (each, a "Parent
Indemnifying Party" or,  collectively, the "Parent Indemnifying Parties" and,
together  with the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties, the "Indemnifying 
Parties") agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify the  Stockholders,
Affiliates of Stockholders (excluding after the  Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries),  and each of their respective officers,
directors, agents or  employees, and their respective successors and assigns
(each a  "Stockholder Indemnified Party," or, collectively, the 
"Stockholder Indemnified Parties" and, together with the Parent  Indemnified
Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") from and  against any Adverse
Consequences a Stockholder Indemnified  Party actually suffers resulting
from, arising out of, or  caused by the breach.   (iii) For a period of one
year from and after the  Effective Time, the Sellers shall indemnify the
Parent  Indemnified Parties from and against any fees or commissions  to any
broker, finder, or agent with respect to the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for which any of  the Parent Indemnified Parties become liable
or obligated as a    61    result of any agreement entered into by the
Company or the  Stockholders on a several and not joint basis pro rata 
according to each Seller\'s percentage of the total Purchase  Price, Merger
Consideration and Option Payment received by all  of the Sellers.   (iv)
For a period of one year from and after the  Effective Time, the Sellers
shall indemnify the Parent  Indemnified Parties from and against the fees and
expenses  described in the final sentence of ss.12(k) on a several and  not
joint basis pro rata according to each Seller\'s percentage  of the total
Purchase Price, Merger Consideration and Option  Payment received by all of
the Sellers.   (c) Matters Involving Third Parties.   (i) If any third
party shall notify any Indemnified  Party with respect to any matter (a
"Third Party Claim") which  may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against any  Indemnifying Party under this ss.10, then the Indemnified 
Party shall promptly notify Parent or the Stockholders  Representative (as
the case may be) thereof in writing  describing the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail (a  "Notice of Indemnification"), which notice shall
contain an  estimate of the amount of Adverse Consequences, if known, and 
method of computation thereof, and a reference to the specific  provisions of
this Agreement in respect of which it elects to  seek indemnification;
provided, however, that no delay on the  part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying any Indemnifying  Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation  hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the 
Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.   (ii) Any Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to  defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party
Claim  with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the 
Indemnified Party so long as (A) the Indemnifying Party  provides the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably  acceptable to the Indemnified
Party that (1) in the case of a  Parent Indemnifying Party, the Parent
Indemnifying Party will  have the financial resources to defend against the
Third Party  Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder or 
(2) in the case of a Seller Indemnifying Party, the amount of  the Third
Party Claim does not, or would not reasonably be  expected to, exceed the
Escrow Amount as then currently in  effect and (B) the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of  the Third Party Claim reasonably diligently;
provided,  however, that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified 
Party in writing of its election to assume such defense prior  to the
commencement of trial of such Third Party Claim (the  "Notice Period"). An
election by the Indemnifying Party to so  assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim shall  constitute an admission by the Indemnifying Party
that it is  obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to 
such Third Party Claim; provided that during the Notice Period  the
Indemnified Party provides all such reasonable  information, access and
assistance to the Indemnifying Party  to assess whether the claim is
indemnifiable hereunder. In the  event that an Indemnifying Party exercises
the right to the  assume defense against any such Third Party Claim as
provided  above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the 
Indemnifying Party in such defense and use reasonable best    62   
efforts to make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the  Indemnifying
Party\'s expense (excluding normal internal  overhead), all relevant
witnesses, records, materials and  information in the Indemnified Party\'s
possession or control  as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
If the  Indemnifying Party does not exercise its right to assume the 
defense of any such Third Party Claim, nothing herein or any  actions taken
by any party hereunder shall be used as an  inference that such Third Party
Claim is or is not  indemnifiable pursuant to this ss.10.   (iii) If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the  defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with ss.10(c)(ii)  above, (A) the Indemnified Party may retain
separate  co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the 
defense of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party  will not consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into  any settlement with respect to
the Third Party Claim without  the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, and (C)  the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any 
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the  Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the  Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld unreasonably or delayed)  unless any such judgment or settlement
involves only the  payment of money damages by one or more of the
Indemnifying  Parties and any such settlement contains a full and complete 
release in favor of all Indemnified Parties. The Indemnified  Party shall, at
the reasonable request of the Indemnifying  Party, provide the Indemnifying
Party with periodic updates on  the status of any Third Party Claim for which
the Indemnifying  Party has not assumed the defense and shall use
reasonable  efforts to retain records pertaining to such Third Party Claim 
for a reasonable period of time.   (iv) During the Notice Period and
thereafter, unless  and until such time as the Indemnifying Party elects to
defend  the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, (A) the 
Indemnified Party may defend the Third Party Claim in any  manner it
reasonably may, upon advice of counsel and after  reasonable consultation
with the Indemnifying Party, deem  appropriate; provided that (1) the
Indemnified  Party\'s choice of counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to 
the Indemnifying Party and (2) the Indemnified Party will not  consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any  settlement without the prior written
consent of the  Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld).   (d)
Determination of Adverse Consequences.   (i) Certain Limitations. The amount
of any Adverse  Consequences with respect to any claim for indemnification 
hereunder shall be determined net of (i) any insurance  proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar  payment received by the Indemnified
Party or any of its  Affiliates (it being understood that the Indemnified
Party and  its Affiliates shall pursue such proceeds or payments in good 
faith, provided that good faith shall not require the filing  of a lawsuit)
with respect to such claim (such proceeds or  payment to be paid over to the
Indemnifying Party up to the  amount paid by the Indemnifying Party if
received after   63    payment of the indemnification claim by the
Indemnifying  Party) and (ii) any reserves provided for the item in
question  in the Financial Statements. Each of the Parties agrees to  take,
and cause its Indemnified Parties to take, all  reasonable steps to mitigate
their respective Adverse  Consequences upon and after becoming aware of any
event or  condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to  any
Adverse Consequence that are indemnifiable pursuant to  this ss.10. The
amount of any Adverse Consequences with  respect to any claim for
indemnification hereunder shall be  determined net of any Tax benefit
actually realized by the  Indemnified Party with respect to such claim;
provided,  however, that any Tax benefit resulting from such a claim  shall
be determined only after applying all other deductions  and losses, including
any net operating loss carryforwards,  available to the Indemnified Party, as
if the Tax benefit  arising from such claim did not exist (for example, all 
existing net operating loss carryforwards would have to be  exhausted before
a "Tax benefit" would be actually realized  from such a claim) and provided
further that creating or  increasing a net operating loss carryforward shall
be deemed  not to create a Tax benefit. To the extent such claim does not 
give rise to a currently realizable Tax benefit, if the amount  with respect
to which any claim is made gives rise to a  subsequently realized Tax benefit
to the Indemnified Party,  such Indemnified Party shall refund to the
Indemnifying Party  the amount of such Tax benefit when, as and if realized.
The  amount of Adverse Consequences for any claim for  indemnification
hereunder shall include interest at the  Applicable Rate from the date that
is five (5) days after the  time the Indemnified Party paid such amount to a
third party  through and including the date of payment of such claim by the 
Indemnifying Party.   (ii) Matters Involving Environmental Claims. Parent 
agrees to cooperate with the Sellers and to take all  commercially reasonable
actions to mitigate all Adverse  Consequences that would otherwise be subject
to  indemnification under ss.10(b) above regarding any breach of  any
representation or warranty in ss.7(w) above. Nothing in  this Agreement shall
be construed to preclude the Parent  Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate)
from acting in a  commercially reasonable and prudent manner (it being 
understood that whether an action is commercially reasonable  and prudent
shall be determined without any consideration of  the indemnification set
forth under ss.10(b) above regarding  any breach of any representation or
warranty in ss.7(w) above)  after becoming aware of any Liabilities under
Environmental  Law or Environmental Claims (or conditions that could 
reasonably be expected, if the affected property continues to  be used in the
same manner in which it is currently used, to  give rise to such claims or
Liabilities). In any case, the  Stockholder Indemnifying Parties shall have
no obligation to  indemnify for any Adverse Consequences arising out of the 
implementation by or on behalf of the Parent Indemnified Party  (or any
Affiliate) of measures with respect to the condition  giving rise to such
claim for indemnification, to the extent  such measures are not (i)
reasonably cost-effective for  addressing such condition, (ii) required by
applicable  Environmental Law in effect as of the Effective Date or by any 
environmental regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the  matter acting
pursuant to such Environmental Law, or (iii)    64    reasonably
necessary for the continued use of the property at  issue as it was used
immediately prior to the Closing Date.   (e) Other Indemnification
Provisions.   (i) The Parties agree that, from and after the  Effective
Time, the remedies provided in this ss.10 ["Remedies  for Breaches of this
Agreement"], ss.12(k) ["Miscellaneous-  Expenses"] and ss.12(o)
["Miscellaneous-Specific  Performance"] are the exclusive remedies for any
breach of any  representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement; 
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein  shall limit any
party\'s liability for fraud or willful  misconduct. Effective as of the
Effective Time, and without  limiting any rights any Seller may have
hereunder or pursuant  to any other agreement or instrument benefiting such
Seller,  each Seller hereby waives, and acknowledges and agrees that it 
shall not have and shall not exercise or assert, any right of  contribution
or subrogation against the Company or the  Surviving Corporation in
connection with any Adverse  Consequences claimed by any Parent Indemnified
Party pursuant  to ss.10(a) by reason of the fact that the Company is the 
Party which made the representation or warranty or agreed to  the covenant
which is the basis for such indemnification  claim. Each of the Sellers
hereby agree, as among themselves  and without limiting the rights of any
Parent Indemnified  Party, that they shall be liable for, and contribute an
amount  equal to, any indemnity payment made by any other Seller  (including
by disbursement of such other Seller\'s pro rata  interest in the Escrow
Fund) (x) arising out of a breach by  such Seller of any representation,
warranty or covenant under  this Agreement or (y) made pursuant to Section
10(b)(iii) and  relating to a broker, finder or agent that was retained by 
such Seller or an Affiliate of such Seller (other than the  Company or any of
its Subsidiaries).   (ii) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to 
this ss.10 and ss.12(k) shall be treated for Tax purposes as  an adjustment
to the consideration received by the  Stockholders unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.   (f) Escrow Fund Procedures.   (i) Distributions from
Escrow Fund to Stockholders.  Upon the one-year anniversary of the Closing
Date (the  "Distribution Date"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver any 
remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders based  on each
Stockholder\'s sharing percentage to be set forth in  the Escrow Agreement
(the "Sharing Percentage"), less any  amounts that would be reasonably
necessary to satisfy any then  pending and unsatisfied or unresolved claims
specified in any  Escrow Claim Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
the  Distribution Date, and less any applicable withholding tax.  Amounts
not distributed under the foregoing from time to time  in respect of pending
and unsatisfied or unresolved claims  shall remain in the Escrow Fund until
the related claims have  been resolved or until any such portion of such
amounts is  determined pursuant to ss.10(f)(iv) to be no longer
necessary    65    to satisfy such claims. As soon as all such claims
have been  resolved or any such portion of such amounts is determined 
pursuant to ss.10(f)(iv) to be no longer necessary to satisfy  such claims,
the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the  Stockholders based on each
Stockholder\'s Sharing Percentage  the remaining portion of such
undistributed amount, if any  (and any remaining amounts in the
Representative Expense  Fund), not required to satisfy such claims (less
any  applicable withholding tax).   (ii) Claims Upon Escrow Fund. Upon
receipt by the  Escrow Agent on or before the Distribution Date of a notice 
from Parent (an "Escrow Claim Notice"),   (A) stating that an
indemnification claim or  claims pursuant to ss.10(b)(i) or any other
provision  of this Agreement that expressly contemplates payment  to be made
out of the Escrow Fund is being made;   (B) stating, in the case of an
indemnification  claim or claims pursuant to ss.10(b)(i) of this  Agreement
that Adverse Consequences are in excess of  the Deductible Amount; and  
(C) specifying in reasonable detail the Adverse  Consequences in respect of
the claim, the Escrow Agent  shall, subject to the provisions of
ss.ss.10(a),  10(f)(iii) and 10(f)(iv), deliver to Parent out of the  Escrow
Fund, as promptly as practicable, cash held in  the Escrow Fund in an amount
equal to such Adverse  Consequences. Cash contributed to the Escrow Fund by 
the Stockholders in accordance with ss.4(c) hereof  shall be delivered to
Parent out of the Escrow Fund  pro rata based on each Stockholder\'s
contribution to  the Escrow Fund.   (iii) Objections to Claims. At the time
of delivery of  any Escrow Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate
copy  of such Escrow Claim Notice shall be delivered to the  Stockholders\'
Representative, and, for a period of thirty (30)  Business Days after the
receipt by the Escrow Agent of such  Escrow Claim Notice, the Escrow Agent
shall make no payment  pursuant to ss.10(f)(ii) hereof unless the Escrow
Agent shall  have received written authorization from the Stockholders\' 
Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of  such thirty
(30) Business Day period, the Escrow Agent shall  make payment in accordance
with ss.10(f)(ii) hereof; provided  that no such payment may be made if the
Stockholders\'  Representative shall object in a written statement to  the
claim made in the Escrow Claim Notice and such statement  shall have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent  prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30) Business Day  period.   (iv) Resolution of Conflicts.   (A)
In case the Stockholders\' Representative  shall so object in writing to any
claim or claims by  Parent made in any Escrow Claim Notice, the 
Stockholders\' Representative and Parent shall attempt    66     in
good faith for thirty (30) Business Days to agree  upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect  to each of such claims. If the
Stockholders\'  Representative and Parent should so agree, a  memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be  prepared and signed by both parties
and shall be  furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall  be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall  pay the amount set forth
in such memorandum in  accordance with the terms thereof.   (B) If no such
agreement can be reached after  good faith negotiation, Parent or the
Stockholders\'  Representative may institute proceedings in a court of 
competent jurisdiction (in accordance with ss.12(p))  to resolve any such
dispute, and each of Parent and  Stockholders\' Representative shall seek to
resolve  such dispute in as expeditious a manner as  practicable. The
parties to any such proceeding shall  each pay its own costs and expenses
incurred in  connection with the application of the provisions of 
ss.10(f)(iv).   (g) Stockholders\' Representative.   (i) Appointment. The
Company and the Stockholders hereby  appoint KLC as agent and attorney-in-
fact (the "Stockholders\'  Representative") for and on behalf of the
Stockholders. The  Stockholders\' Representative shall have full power and 
authority to represent all of the Stockholders and their  successors with
respect to all matters arising under this  Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
and all actions taken by the  Stockholders\' Representative hereunder and
thereunder shall be  final, conclusive and binding upon all such Stockholders
and  their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in  writing by
each of them and no Stockholder shall have the right  to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same. The  Stockholders\' Representative
shall take any and all actions  which it believes are necessary or
appropriate under this  Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf
of the  Stockholders, as fully as if the Stockholders were acting on  their
own behalf, including executing the Escrow Agreement as  Stockholders\'
Representative, giving and receiving any notice  or instruction permitted or
required under this Agreement or  the Escrow Agreement by the Stockholders\'
Representative or any  Stockholder, interpreting all of the terms and
provisions of  this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, authorizing

Agreement with  respect to all matters arising under this Agreement and the 
Escrow Agreement, taking any and all other actions specified in  or

engaging counsel, accountants or other Stockholders\'  Representatives in
connection with the foregoing matters.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the  Stockholders\' Representative shall have full power and 
authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of this  Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and to consent to any  amendment hereof or thereof on
behalf of all such Stockholders  and such successors.   (ii) Authorization.
By their approval and adoption of  this Agreement, the Stockholders hereby
authorize the  Stockholders\' Representative, on the Stockholders\' behalf,
to:   (A) receive all notices or documents given or to  be given to any of
the Stockholders by Parent pursuant  hereto or to the Escrow Agreement or in
connection  herewith or therewith and to receive and accept  service of
legal process in connection with any suit  or proceeding arising under this
Agreement or the  Escrow Agreement;   (B) deliver to Parent at the
Effective Time all  certificates and documents to be delivered to Parent  by
any of the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement,  together with any other

legal counsel, and such accountants  and other advisors for any of the
Stockholders and  incur such other expenses on behalf of any of the 
Stockholders in connection with this Agreement or the  Escrow Agreement and
the transactions contemplated  hereby or thereby as the Stockholders\'
Representative  may in its sole discretion deem appropriate; and   (D) take

of:   1. taking such other action as the Stockholders\'  Representative or
any of the Stockholders is  authorized to take under this Agreement or the 
Escrow Agreement;   2. receiving all documents or certificates and  making
all determinations, on behalf of any of  the Stockholders, required under
this Agreement  or the Escrow Agreement;   3. all such other matters as the
Stockholders\'  Representative may in its sole discretion deem  necessary or

Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;  and   4.
all such action as may be necessary after the  Effective Time to carry out
any of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and  the Escrow
Agreement, including, without  limitation, the defense and/or settlement of
any  claims for which indemnification is sought  pursuant to ss.10 and any
waiver of any  obligation of Parent or the Surviving  Corporation.   All
actions, decisions and instructions of the  Stockholders\' Representative
shall be conclusive and  binding upon all of the Stockholders and no
Stockholder  shall have any claim or cause of action against the 
Stockholders\' Representative, and the Stockholders\'  Representative shall
have no liability to any Stockholder,  for any action taken, decision made or
instruction given  by the Stockholders\' Representative in connection with
the  Escrow Agreement or this Agreement, except in the case of  its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct.   (iii) Indemnification of
Stockholders\' Representative.  The Stockholders\' Representative shall incur
no liability to  the Stockholders or the Escrow Agent with respect to any 
action taken or suffered by it in reliance upon any note,  direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other documents  reasonably believed by
the Stockholders\' Representative to be  genuinely and duly authorized by at
least a majority in  interest of the Stockholders (or the successors or
assigns  thereto), nor for other action or inaction taken or omitted in 
good faith in connection herewith or with the Escrow  Agreement, in any case
except for liability to the  Stockholders for its own gross negligence or
willful  misconduct. The Stockholders\' Representative shall be  indemnified
for and shall be held harmless by the Stockholders  against any loss,
liability or expense incurred by the  Stockholders\' Representative or any of
its Affiliates and any  of their respective partners, directors, officers,
employees,  agents, stockholders, consultants, attorneys, accountants, 
advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, in  each case
relating to the Stockholders\' Representative\'s  conduct as Stockholders\'
Representative, other than such  losses, liabilities or expenses resulting
from the  Stockholders\' Representative\'s gross negligence or willful 
misconduct in connection with its performance under this  Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. This indemnification shall  survive the termination of this
Agreement. The costs of such  indemnification (including the costs and
expenses of enforcing  this right of indemnification) shall be paid from
the  Representative Expense Fund, and thereafter and otherwise  shall be the
responsibility of the Stockholders. For all  purposes hereunder, a majority
in interest of the Stockholders  shall be determined on the basis of each
Stockholder\'s  ownership of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the 
Effective Time (assuming the exercise or conversion of all  Company Stock
Options outstanding immediately prior to the   69    Effective Time). The
Stockholders\' Representative may, in all  questions arising under this
Agreement, rely on the advice of  counsel and for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good  faith by the Stockholders\' Representative in accordance
with  such advice, the Stockholders\' Representative shall not be  liable to
the Stockholders or the Escrow Agent. In no event  shall the Stockholders\'
Representative be liable under this  ss.10(g) or otherwise for any loss of
profits or incidental,  consequential, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary
or other  similar damages.   (iv) Access to Information. Subject to
applicable  privileges, Parent shall provide the Stockholders\' 
Representative reasonable access, subject to appropriate  confidentiality
restrictions, to information of and concerning  any Parent Indemnity Claim
which is in the possession or  control of Parent and the reasonable
assistance of the  Surviving Corporation\'s officers and employees for
purposes of  performing the Stockholders\' Representative\'s duties under 
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and exercising its  rights under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,  including for the purpose of evaluating
any Parent Indemnity  Claim by Parent; provided that the Stockholders\' 
Representative shall treat confidentially and not, except as  reasonably
necessary in connection with enforcing its rights  or the rights of the
Stockholders hereunder or under the  Escrow Agreement, disclose any nonpublic
information from or  concerning any Parent Indemnity Claim to anyone (except
to the  Stockholders\' Representative\'s attorneys, accountants or other 
advisers, to Stockholders, to the arbitrators appointed to  resolve disputes
pursuant to this Agreement, and on a  need-to-know basis to other individuals
who agree to keep such  information confidential).   (v) Reasonable
Reliance. In the performance of its  duties hereunder, the Stockholders\'
Representative shall be  entitled to rely upon any document or instrument
reasonably  believed by it to be genuine, accurate as to content and  signed
by any Stockholder or Parent. The Stockholders\'  Representative may assume
that any person purporting to give  any notice in accordance with the
provisions hereof has been  duly authorized to do so.   (vi) Attorney-in-
Fact.   (A) The Stockholders\' Representative is hereby  appointed and
constituted the true and lawful  attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder, with
full power  in his, her or its name and on his, her or its behalf  to act
according to the terms of this Agreement and  the Escrow Agreement in the
absolute discretion of the  Stockholders\' Representative; and in general to
do all  things and to perform all acts including, without  limitation,
executing and delivering the Escrow  Agreement and any other agreements,
certificates,  receipts, instructions, notices or instruments  contemplated
by or deemed advisable in connection with  the Escrow Agreement.   
70     (B) This power of attorney and all authority  hereby conferred is
granted and shall be irrevocable  and shall not be terminated by any act of
any  Stockholder, by operation of law, whether by such  Stockholder\'s
death, disability protective supervision  or any other event. Without
limitation to the  foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the 
performance of a special obligation and, accordingly,  each Stockholder
hereby renounces its, his or her  right to renounce this power of attorney
unilaterally  any time before the end of the survival period set  forth in
ss.10(a) and the complete distribution of the  Escrow Fund.   (C) Each
Stockholder hereby waives any and all  defenses which may be available to
contest, negate or  disaffirm the action of the Stockholders\' 
Representative taken in good faith under the Escrow  Agreement.   (D)
Notwithstanding the power of attorney  granted in this ss.10(g), no
agreement, instrument,  acknowledgement or other act or document shall be 
ineffective by reason only of the Stockholders having  signed or given such
directly instead of the  Stockholders\' Representative.   (vii) Liability.
If the Stockholders\' Representative  is required by the terms of the Escrow
Agreement to determine  the occurrence of any event or contingency, the
Stockholders\'  Representative shall, in making such determination, be
liable  to the Stockholders only for its proven bad faith as  determined in
light of all the circumstances, including the  time and facilities available
to it in the ordinary conduct of  business. In determining the occurrence of
any such event or  contingency, the Stockholders\' Representative may request
from  any of the Stockholders such reasonable additional evidence as  the
Stockholders\' Representative in its sole discretion may  deem necessary to
determine any fact relating to the  occurrence of such event or contingency,
and may at any time  inquire of and consult with others, including any of
the  Stockholders, and the Stockholders\' Representative shall not  be
liable to any Stockholder for any damages resulting from  its delay in acting
hereunder pending its receipt and  examination of additional evidence
requested by it.   (viii) Orders. The Stockholders\' Representative is 
authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with final,  nonappealable
orders or decisions issued or process entered by  any court of competent
jurisdiction or arbitrator with respect  to the Escrow Fund. If any portion
of the Escrow Fund is  disbursed to the Stockholders\' Representative and is
at any  time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order,  or
in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or  delivery of any
such property shall be stayed or enjoined by  any court order, or in case any
order, judgment or decree  shall be made or entered by any court affecting
such property  or any part thereof, then and in any such event, the 
Stockholders\' Representative is authorized, in its sole  discretion, but in
good faith, to rely upon and comply with  any such order, writ, judgment or
decree which it is advised  by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon
it without the    71    need for appeal or other action; and if the
Stockholders\'  Representative complies with any such order, writ, judgment
or  decree, it shall not be liable to any Stockholder by reason of  such
compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or  decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set  aside or vacated.   (ix)
Successor Stockholders\' Representative. The  Stockholders\' Representative
shall have the right at any time  during the term of the Escrow Agreement to
appoint a successor  Stockholders\' Representative; provided, however, that
such  appointment of a successor Stockholders\' Representative shall  not be
effective until the delivery to the Escrow Agent of  executed counterparts of
a writing signed by the Stockholders\'  Representative with respect to such
appointment, together with  an acknowledgment signed by the successor
Stockholders\'  Representative appointed in such writing that he or she 
accepts the responsibility of successor Stockholders\'  Representative and
agrees to perform and be bound by all of  the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the  Stockholders\' Representative. Each successor
Stockholders\'  Representative shall have all of the power, authority,
rights  and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original 
Stockholders\' Representative, and the term "Stockholders\'  Representative"
as used herein and in the Escrow Agreement  shall be deemed to include any
interim or successor  Stockholders\' Representative.   (x) Expenses of the
Stockholders\' Representative. The  Stockholders\' Representative shall be
entitled to withdraw  cash amounts held in the Representative Expense Fund
in  reimbursement for out of pocket fees and expenses (including  legal,
accounting and other advisors\' fees and expenses, if  applicable) incurred
by the Stockholders\' Representative in  performing under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. Any  and all amounts in the Representative Expense Fund
shall  otherwise remain in such fund until such time as the  Stockholders\'
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to  distribute any or all of
such fund to the Stockholders based  on each Stockholder\'s Sharing
Percentage.   (xi) Actions of Stockholders\' Representative. Any  action
taken by the Stockholders\' Representative pursuant to  the authority granted
in this ss.10(g) shall be effective and  absolutely binding on each
Stockholder notwithstanding any  contrary action of, or direction from, any
Stockholder, except  for actions taken by the Stockholders\' Representative
which  are in bad faith.   (xii) Binding Appointment. The provisions of
this  Agreement, including without limitation ss.10 hereof, shall be 
binding upon each Stockholder and the executors, heirs, legal 
representatives and successors of each Stockholder, and any  references in
this Agreement to a Stockholder or the  Stockholders shall mean and include
the successors to the  Stockholders\' rights hereunder, whether pursuant to 
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution  or
otherwise.    72     11. Termination.   (a) Termination of Agreement.

two Business Days after the  consummation of such Purchase Proposal, each
Seller  participating in such Purchase Proposal shall pay to Parent  fifty
percent (50%) of the product of (A) the amount by which  the Purchase
Proposal Consideration received by such Seller  exceeds the Per Share
Purchase Price multiplied by (B) the  number of shares of Company Common
Stock sold by such Seller  in such transaction or, in the event shares of
Company Stock  are not sold in such transaction, the value received by such 
Seller when it thereafter sells such shares, calculated on a  per share
basis, with payment to be made within two Business  Days after such sale.  
(iii) The Company, Sellers and Parent acknowledge that  the agreements
contained in this ss.11(b) are an integral part  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that,  without these agreements, none of
the Company, Sellers or  Parent would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if the  Company or Sellers fail promptly to pay any amount due to  Parent
pursuant to this ss.11(b), and in order to obtain such  payment, Parent
commences a suit which results in a judgment  against the Company or Sellers
for the fees and expenses in  this ss.11(b), the Company or Sellers (as the
case may be)  shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including 
reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses) incurred in  connection with such
suit, together with interest on the  aggregate amount of the fees and
expenses at a rate equal to  the prime rate reported in the Wall Street
Journal on the date  such payment was required to be made plus two percent;
it  being understood that each Seller shall be liable only for its  pro rata
portion of such costs and expenses and interest (if  any) based on the number
of shares of Company Common Stock  such Seller owned as compared to the
shares of Company Common  Stock owned by all Sellers.    74     (c)
Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to
ss.11(a) above, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no effect, and
all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without
any liability of any Party to any other Party (except for any liability of
any Party then in breach) and except that ss.ss.8(e)(ii), 11(b), 12(c),
12(g), 12(h), 12(i), 12(j), 12(k), 12(l), 12(m), 12(n), 12(o), 12(p) and
12(r) shall continue in full force and effect.   12. Miscellaneous.   (a)
Press Releases and Public Announcements. Parent, the Stockholders\'
Representative and the Company shall mutually agree upon the timing and
content of any public statements with respect to the Merger and
any communications with third parties, except that any Party may make any
public disclosure that, upon advice of counsel, is required by applicable law
or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities
(in which case the disclosing Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Parties prior to making the disclosure and
to agree on the nature, extent and form of such disclosure).   (b) No
Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in ss.8(k) (Indemnification of
Directors and Officers; Insurance), this Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.   (c) Entire Agreement. This
Agreement (including the documents referred to herein) constitutes the entire
agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.   (d)
Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Prior to the Effective Time, no Party may assign either
this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written approval
of Parent and the Company; provided, however, that Parent may (i) assign any
or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates
and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations
hereunder (in any or all of which cases Parent nonetheless shall remain
responsible for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder), and
(iii) pledge or collaterally assign any or all of its rights and interests
hereunder to its lenders, but any such assignment, delegation or pledge
permitted by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub
of any of their obligations hereunder. Following the Effective Time, no Party
may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of Parent and the
Stockholders\' Representative.   (e) Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.    75     (f) Headings. The section headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   (g) Notices. All

and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws
principles.    78    (i) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment,
modification or supplement of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Parent and the Company and
if the Closing has occurred, the Stockholders\' Representative. No waiver by
any Party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence. The failure of any Party at any time to
require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall in no manner
affect the right to enforce the same.   (j) Severability. Any term or
provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation
in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of
the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. To the extent permitted by law,
the Parties waive any provision of law which renders any such provision
prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.   (k) Expenses. Except for
filing fees under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and Transfer Taxes (the "Excluded
Expenses"), all of which will be borne by Parent, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Sellers shall bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall bear its own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses and all expenses incurred by it in
connection with ss.8(b)(iv) of this Agreement, other than the Excluded
Expenses) incurred in connection with (i) this Agreement, (ii) the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) the preparation and filing of,
and transactions contemplated by, that certain Registration Statement on Form
S-1 (Registration No. 333-114693) filed with the SEC on April 21, 2004, as
amended to date, and that certain Registration Statement on Form S-4
(Registration No. 333-114701) filed with the SEC on April 22, 2004, as
amended to date; provided, however, if immediately prior to the Effective
Time, as certified by the Company, the estimated amount of such Company costs
and expenses exceeds $3,500,000, then such excess amount (the "Excess
Expenses") shall be deducted pursuant to ss.3(a)(i)(A) on a pro rata basis
from the Merger Consideration and Stock Sale Purchase Price paid in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock and the Option Payment paid in respect
of each Company Option in accordance with ss.2 and ss.4. In addition, (A) if
the estimated amount of such Company costs and expenses was less than or
equal to $3,500,000 and if following the Effective Time such actual costs and
expenses exceed $3,500,000, then the Sellers agree on a several and not joint
basis pro rata according to each Seller\'s percentage of the total Purchase
Price, Merger Consideration and Option Payment received by all of the Sellers
to indemnify Parent for such excess amount in accordance with and subject to
ss.10(b)(iv) and (B) if the amount of such Company costs and expenses as
estimated and certified by the Company was greater than $3,500,000 and if
following the Effective Time such actual Company costs and expenses exceed
the amount so estimated and certified, then the Sellers agree on a several
and not joint basis pro rata according to each    79   Seller\'s
percentage of the total Purchase Price, Merger Consideration and Option
Payment received by all of the Sellers to indemnify Parent for such excess
amount in accordance with and subject to ss.10(b)(iv).   (l) Transfer Taxes.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by Parent, and the Company, the Sellers and
Parent shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and
forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of such tax laws. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Transfer Taxes" shall mean transfer,
documentary, sales, use, registration and other such Taxes (including all
applicable real estate transfer taxes).   (m) Construction. The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any
reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be
deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall mean
including without limitation.   (n) Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules.
The Exhibits and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof. Each of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Seller Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in paragraphs
corresponding to the lettered and numbered paragraphs to which the
information relates. The description or listing of a matter, event or thing
within either disclosure schedule (whether in response for a description or
listing of material items or otherwise) shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment that such matter, event or thing is "material" for purposes of
this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or item pursuant to any section of
either disclosure schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed for the
purpose of all other sections of such disclosure schedule where its relevance
or applicability is reasonably apparent. Disclosure of any fact or item
pursuant to any Company SEC Filing shall be deemed to have been disclosed for
all purposes of this Agreement. Matters reflected on either disclosure
schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected therein and the inclusion of such matters shall not be deemed an
admission that such matters were required to be reflected on such disclosure
schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.  
(o) Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state
thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to the
provisions set forth in ss.12(p), in addition (subject to ss.10(e)) to any
other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.   
80     (p) Jurisdiction; Attorneys\' Fees; Waiver of Jury Trial.   (i)
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and  unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the  exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware

and all claims, grievances, demands, controversies, causes of  action or
disputes of any nature whatsoever (including tort  and contract claims, and
claims upon any law, statute, order  or regulation) (hereinafter "Transaction
Claims") arising out  of, in connection with or in relation to (i) the 
interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement or  (ii) any
relationship before, at the time of entering into,  during the term of or
upon or after expiration or termination  of this Agreement, between the
parties hereto, and each of the  parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (A) agrees not  to commence any Transaction Claims except in
such courts, (B)  agrees that any Transaction Claims may be heard and
determined  in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by 
law, in such Federal court, (C) waives, to the fullest extent  it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it  may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any  Transaction Claims in any such Delaware State or
Federal  court, and (D) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,  the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of  such Transaction
Claims in any such Delaware State or Federal  court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment  in any such Transaction Claims shall be
conclusive and may be  enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in  any other manner provided by law. Each party to this
Agreement  irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner 
provided for notices in ss.12(g). Nothing in this Agreement  will affect the
right of any party to this Agreement to serve  process in any other manner
permitted by law.   (ii) The Parties hereto agree that the prevailing 
party in any such Transaction Claims shall be entitled to  recover its costs
and expenses, including reasonable  attorneys\' fees, incurred in connection
with such action,  including any appeal of such action.   (iii) EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY  CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO  INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT  HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY  HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY  OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR  THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND  ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF  ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT  SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK  TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS  CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH  
81    WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO  THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND  CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS PARAGRAPH.   (q) Computation of Time. Whenever the last day for
the exercise of any privilege or the discharge of any duty under this
Agreement shall fall upon any date which is not a Business Day, the Party
having such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such
duty on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day.   (r) Parent
Guarantee of Merger Sub Obligations. Parent agrees to take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to
perform all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under
this Agreement. Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Sellers the full and
complete performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be
liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
of Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this
Agreement. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first
against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, protest,
notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its
obligations set forth in this ss.12(r).     *****     82      IN
