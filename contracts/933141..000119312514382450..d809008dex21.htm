AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Louisiana Business
Corporation Law ("BCL"), at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined),
Company shall be merged with and into Purchaser (the " _Merger_ "). Following
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease, and
Purchaser shall continue as the surviving corporation after the Merger.
Simultaneously with the  execution and delivery of this Agreement, Old Florida Bank and New

Subsidiaries shall cease, and Purchaser Bank shall continue as the surviving
corporation after the Bank Mergers. The parties intend that the Bank Mergers
will become effective immediately following the Effective Time or at such
other time as Purchaser shall determine in its sole discretion.

Section 1.2 _Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place on a
mutually agreed upon Business Day as soon as practicable after the date on
which the last condition to Closing is satisfied. In no event shall the
Closing occur after the first day of the calendar month following the month
subsequent to the month in which occurred the later of (i) receipt of
all Requisite Regulatory Approvals of the Merger and the expiration of all
required waiting periods, or (ii) shareholder approval of this Agreement at
the Company Shareholders Meeting to be held pursuant to Section 5.4(b) of this
Agreement, or such other date as the parties hereto may mutually agree. If
all conditions in Article VI hereof are satisfied, or waived by the party
entitled to grant such waiver, at the Closing (i) the parties shall each
provide to the others such proof of satisfaction of the conditions in Article
VI as the party whose obligations are conditioned upon such satisfaction may
reasonably request, (ii) the certificates, letters and opinions required by
Article VI shall be delivered, (iii) the appropriate officers of the parties
shall execute, deliver and acknowledge this Agreement, and (iv) the parties
shall take such further action, including (without limitation) filing the
Certificate of Merger, as are required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 

(b) If on any date established for the Closing all conditions in Article VI
hereof have not been satisfied or waived by each party entitled to grant such
waiver, then either party, on one or more occasions, may declare a delay of
the Closing of such duration, not exceeding ten (10) Business Days, as the
declaring party shall select, but no such delay shall extend beyond the last
date set forth in Section 7.1(b)(i) and no such delay shall interfere with
the right of either party to declare a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(i). The Closing shall take place telephonically, electronically or at
the office of Purchaser set forth in Section 8.2.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by taking the following actions:

 

(a) Company and Purchaser shall file a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Louisiana, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the BCL,
and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make any and
all other filings or recordings required under the BCL.

 

(b) The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger is
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Louisiana, or such later
time as may be agreed in writing by Purchaser and Company and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



2 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the BCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Company shall vest in Purchaser, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of Purchaser.

Section 1.5  _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) The articles of incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of Purchaser
following the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law.

 

(b) The bylaws of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of Purchaser following the Merger until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of Purchaser following the Merger until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified.

 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers following the Merger until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or approved and qualified.

 

Section 1.8 _Reservation of Right to Change Structure_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective
Time, Purchaser and Company may agree at any time to change the method of
effecting the business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to
the extent that they mutually deem such a change to be desirable; _provided_
, that (A) any such change shall not affect the United States federal income
tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock, and (B) no
such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration
to be issued to holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement
or (ii) impede or delay consummation of the Merger. In the event Purchaser and
Company elect to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate
documents to effect the change.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF CONSTITUENT

 

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Purchaser Capital Stock_. Each share of capital stock of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Capital Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding after, and
shall be unaffected by, the Merger.

 



3 Section 2.2 _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Company, Purchaser
or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Company or Purchaser:

 

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, including
shares of Company Common Stock to be issued on or before the Effective Time
to the holders of Company Preferred Stock upon conversion (collectively, the "
_Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) any Dissenting Company Shares (as hereinafter
defined) and (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.2(d)) shall thereupon be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, subject to
the other provisions of this Article II, 0.34 of a share (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Purchaser (the "
_Purchaser Common Stock_ "), and subject to payment of cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock as provided in Section 2.4.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Measurement Price_ " means the
arithmetic mean of the daily weighted average trading prices of Purchaser
Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as calculated by Bloomberg
Screen AQR using reported trading prices between the hours of 9:30 AM Eastern
Time and 4:00 PM Eastern Time) on each of the fifteen (15) trading days ending
one (1) Business Day immediately prior to the day of the Effective Time. The
Exchange Ratio is subject to possible further adjustment as set forth below:

(i) if the Measurement Price is greater than $70.05 per share, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal the quotient (to the nearest
thousandth of a share) obtained by dividing $23.82 by the Measurement Price;
or

(ii) if the Measurement Price is less than $57.31 per share, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal the quotient (to the nearest
thousandth of a share) obtained by dividing $19.49 by the Measurement Price.

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Preferred
Stock shall automatically convert into one share of Company Common Stock for
each share of Company Preferred Stock.

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (together,
the " _Company Capital Stock_ ") owned or held by Company or Purchaser or any
of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (other
than shares held in trust accounts or otherwise held in a bona fide fiduciary
or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties not
affiliated with Company or Purchaser and shares held, directly or indirectly,
by Company or Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries and acquired
upon exercise of rights in respect of debt arrangements previously made in
good faith and in effect prior to the date hereof) shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(e) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Purchaser shall occur (or for which the relevant record date will occur) as a
result of any reclassification,

 



4  recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary
and without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ , that nothing in
this Section 2.2(e) shall be construed to permit Company or Purchaser to take
any action with respect to their respective securities that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment for Company Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At or promptly after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with an exchange agent designated by Purchaser and
reasonably acceptable to Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") evidence of shares
in book-entry form (or stock certificates (a " _Certificate_ ") at Purchasers
option) representing the aggregate number of shares of Purchaser Capital
Stock into which shares of Company Capital Stock have been converted in
accordance with Section 2.2, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.4. In addition, Purchaser shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time at or after the Effective
Time, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.5.
All shares of Purchaser Capital Stock and dividends and distributions
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to
Sections 2.2, 2.4 or 2.5, except as provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), Purchaser shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each holder of record of (i) an
outstanding Certificate or outstanding Certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock ("
_Company Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Capital
Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Company Shares_ ") which, in
each case, were converted into the right to receive the Purchaser Common
Stock with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.2, (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates or Book-
Entry Company Shares held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Company Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal, and shall contain such other provisions as Purchaser or
the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company
Shares in exchange for the Purchaser Common Stock payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.2. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Company Share to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry
Company Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Purchaser
Common Stock for each share of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by
such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share (subject to deduction for
any required withholding Tax), and such Company Certificate or Book-Entry
Company Share shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on any Purchaser Common Stock payable upon surrender of any Company
Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share. In the event that any Purchaser
Common Stock is to be paid to a Person other

 



5  than the Person in whose name any Company Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Company Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on
such Company Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly
guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Company Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of Purchaser and the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender or transfer, the Purchaser Common Stock, plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.4, payable in respect of shares
of Company Capital Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificate
or Book-Entry Company Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.2, without
any interest thereon.

(c) All shares of Purchaser Capital Stock issued, including any cash paid in
lieu of fractional shares, upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented by such Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares. At the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of Purchaser of the shares of Company Capital Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to Purchaser or the
Exchange Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Company
Shares, such Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable
Law in the case of Dissenting Company Shares. To the extent permitted by Law,
the former Company shareholders shall be entitled to vote after the Effective
Time at any meeting of Purchaser shareholders the number of whole shares of
Purchaser Capital Stock into which their respective shares of Company Capital
Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their
Company Certificates for certificates representing Purchaser Capital Stock in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2, but beginning 60 days
after the Effective Time no such holder shall be entitled to vote on any
matter until such holder surrenders such Company Certificate or Book-Entry
Company Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 2.3.

 

(d) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Purchaser; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Purchaser Common Stock or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares
entitled to receive such consideration, and Purchaser shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of
Company Certificates and Book-Entry Company Shares in the amount of any such
losses to the extent necessary for payment of the Purchaser Common Stock. Any
interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Purchaser or as directed by Purchaser.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any income earned thereon) that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company
Shares for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be paid 

 



6  to Purchaser or as directed by Purchaser, and any holders of Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Purchaser (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of the
Purchaser Common Stock with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock
formerly represented by such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Company
Share, in each case without interest thereon.

(f) None of Purchaser, Company, or the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of Purchaser Capital
Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, or any cash in
lieu of fractional shares, in each case properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Purchaser or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or Purchaser with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Purchaser Common Stock payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(h) Each of Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts that are so deducted and
withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Purchaser
or the Exchange Agent and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each holder that is
to receive a distribution pursuant to this Agreement will have the sole and
exclusive responsibility for the satisfaction and payment of any such
withholding Tax obligations imposed on Purchaser by any Governmental Entity on
account of such distribution and (ii) no distribution will be made to or on
behalf of such holder pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such holder
has made arrangements satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Exchange Agent for
the payment and satisfaction of such withholding Tax obligations.

 

Section 2.4 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Article II, no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued
pursuant to the Merger. Instead, Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid to the
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock that would, pursuant to this
Article II, otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the fraction of a share to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time to
be converted into Purchaser Common Stock) and (y) the Measurement Price.

 



7 Section 2.5 _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to shares of Purchaser Capital Stock
issuable with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock with a record date on
or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares until those Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares are surrendered as provided in this
Article II. Upon surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of
the shares of Purchaser Capital Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (A) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to those shares of Purchaser Capital Stock with a record
date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of this surrender and not previously paid and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
those shares of Purchaser Capital Stock with a record date on or after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of the FBCA ("
_Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Purchaser Common Stock, unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders
right to appraisal under the FBCA. If any such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such share of Company
Common Stock of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become
exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective
Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost,
withdrawn or expired, the Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.2, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.4.
Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices
or demands and any other instruments received by Company relating to rights
to appraisal, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with
respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 

Section 2.7 _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards
of Company_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under the Old Florida Bancshares, Inc. 2009 Stock Option Plan,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a "Company Stock Option") shall cease to represent a
right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
converted automatically into a cash payment by Company (subject to required
tax withholdings) in an amount equal to (a) the difference between (i) the
product of the Exchange Ratio (as may be adjusted) and the Measurement Price,
and (ii) the exercise price per share (the " _Option Payment_ "). Prior to
the receipt of the Option Payment and at the Effective Time, each holder of a
Company Stock Option shall execute a cancellation agreement, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Company. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Company shall deliver the Option Payment to the holders of
Company Stock Options. The Aggregate Option Payment equals the sum of all
Option Payments to holders of Company Stock Options. 

 



8 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Equity Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
transactions described in this Section 2.7, including accrual of an amount in
cash sufficient to effect the necessary cash payment.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall deliver all required notices
(which notices shall have been approved by Purchaser, in its reasonable
discretion) to each holder of Company Stock Options or Company Stock Awards
setting forth each holders or participants rights pursuant to the applicable
Company plan and stating that such Company Stock Options or Company Stock
Awards shall be treated in the manner set forth in this Section 2.7.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Company to Purchaser
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_
") (which sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is
necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or
more representations or warranties contained in this Article III, or to one
or more of Companys covenants contained herein, _provided_ , that disclosure
in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall apply only to the
indicated Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
relevant to another Section of this Agreement, _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect),
Company represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as
now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such
concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Company has previously made available to Purchaser true and complete
copies of Companys articles of incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") and
bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") and the articles or certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable

case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so made available
is in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Significant
Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of the Company Charter or
Company Bylaws or such articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of such Significant Subsidiary, as
applicable.

Section 3.2 _Capital Stock_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 15,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock, 1,500,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value
(the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which 500,000 shares of Company
Preferred Stock are designated as Series A Preferred Stock (" _Company Series
A Preferred Stock_ ") and 700,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock are
designated as Series B Preferred Stock (" _Company Series B Preferred Stock_
"). As of the close of business on October 21, 2014, (i) 10,562,259 shares of
Company Common Stock (excluding treasury shares) were issued and outstanding,
(ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by Company in its treasury,
(iii) 332,586 shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, (iv) 700,000 shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding, and (v) 2,178,969 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to Company Equity Plans (of which 2,124,009
shares were subject to outstanding Company Stock Options and no shares
were subject to outstanding Company Stock Awards). All the outstanding shares
of capital stock of Company are, and all shares reserved for issuance as noted
in clause (v) above will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to any preemptive or similar antidilution rights. No shares of capital stock
of Company are owned by any Subsidiary of Company. Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of
Company or such Subsidiary on any matter. As of the date of this Agreement,
except for this Agreement, as set forth above in this Section 3.2(a), the
Company Stock Options set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, and the shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity
interests of each Subsidiary that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
Company, there are no outstanding (A) shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of Company, (B) securities of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares
of capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (C) stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock
rights, performance units, interests in or rights to the ownership or earnings
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other equity equivalent or equity-
based award or right, (D) subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments, Contracts or other rights to acquire from Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or obligations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,

convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or other
voting securities or equity interests of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
rights or interests described in clause (C) or (E) obligations of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities or to issue, grant, deliver, register, transfer or sell, or cause
to be issued, granted, delivered, registered, transferred or sold, any such
securities. Except for this Agreement, there are no shareholder agreements,
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Company or any of
its

 



10  Subsidiaries is a party or on file with Company with respect to the holding,
voting, registration, redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that
restricts the transfer of, any capital stock or other equity interest of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Section 3.2(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any trust capital securities or other similar securities outstanding.

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list, as of October 26, 2014, of all holders of outstanding Company
Stock Options, indicating, with respect to each Company Stock Option then
outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, the name of the plan under which
such Company Stock Option was granted, the date of grant, exercise price,
vesting schedule and expiration thereof (the " _Company Equity Award Schedule_
"). Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies. The exercise price of each
Company Stock Option is no less than the fair market value of a share of
Company Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such Company Stock
Option and within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated
Treasury Department guidance. Company has made available to Purchaser true and
complete copies of all Company Equity Plans and the forms of all
award agreements evidencing outstanding Company Stock Options.

(c) Except for this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement pursuant to which any Person is
entitled to elect, designate or nominate any director of it or its
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.3 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of (a) each Subsidiary
of Company and the Bank Subsidiaries, including its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation, and (b) each other Person that is not a Subsidiary
but in which Company holds, directly or indirectly, a 5% or greater equity
interest (each, a " _Company Minority Interest Business_ "), and the
percentage of Companys equity interest in such Company Minority Interest
Business relative to all outstanding equity interests (on a fully
diluted basis). All the outstanding shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of each Subsidiary of Company have been duly
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are not
subject to any preemptive or similar rights. All of the shares of capital
stock or other equity or voting interests of each Subsidiary and each Company
Minority Interest Business that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Company
or a Subsidiary thereof are free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, options, rights of first refusal, encumbrances and security interests
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including any limitation on voting, sale,
transfer or other disposition or exercise of any other attribute of
ownership) (collectively, " _Liens_ ") other than restrictions on transfer
under applicable securities Laws. Except for (x) the capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries and (y) its interests
in the Company Minority Interest Businesses, Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any 5% or greater equity, membership interest, partnership
interest, joint venture interest in any Person, or any interest convertible
into, exercisable or exchangeable for, any of the foregoing. In the case of
the Company, except for its ownership of the Bank Subsidiaries, it does not
own, beneficially or of record, either directly or indirectly, any stock or
equity interest in any depository institution (as defined in 12 U.S.C.
Section 1813(c)(1)). The deposits of the Bank Subsidiaries are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

 



11  to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all insurance premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due. No proceedings for the revocation or termination of such deposit
insurance are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. The
Bank Subsidiaries are members in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank
(" _FHLB_ ") of Atlanta.

 

Section 3.4 _Authority_.

 

(a) Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to
obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approval and Company Shareholder Approval
(as hereinafter defined), to consummate, and cause its Bank Subsidiaries to
consummate, the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Company and the consummation by Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly approved by
all necessary corporate action on the part of Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject in the case of the
consummation of the Merger and assuming the accuracy, as of the record date
for the determination of Company shareholders entitled to vote at the Company
Shareholder Meeting, of Purchasers representation and warranty contained in
the second sentence of Section 4.18, to the adoption and approval of this
Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Company
Capital Stock, entitled to vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting and voting
together as single class (such approval of the Merger, hereinafter referred to
as the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "), and to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Louisiana Secretary of State as required by the
BCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
hereto, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Company, enforceable
against Company in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly adopted
resolutions (i) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best
interests of Company and its shareholders, (ii) approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted to the
shareholders of Company at the Company Shareholder Meeting for adoption and
approval and (iv) recommending that Companys shareholders vote in favor of
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), which
resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any
way, except as may be permitted by Section 5.3.

 

(c) Assuming the accuracy, as of the record date for the determination of
Company shareholders entitled to vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting, of
Purchasers representation and warranty contained in the second sentence of
Section 4.18, the Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of Companys Capital Stock or other securities
required in connection with the consummation of the Merger.

 



12 Section 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Company do
not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by Company with the
provisions hereof do not, and will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or remedy or to

the SEC since December 31, 2012 (all such filed or furnished documents,
together with all exhibits and schedules thereto and all information
incorporated therein by reference, the " _Purchaser SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective filing dates (and, in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, as of the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing,
respectively), except to the extent that any Purchaser SEC Document has been
amended by a subsequently filed Purchaser SEC Document prior to the date
hereof, in which case, as of the date of such amendment, (i) the Purchaser
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, and (ii) none of the Purchaser SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

(or incorporated by reference) in the Purchaser SEC Documents comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the

year-end audit adjustments that were not, or are not expected to be, material
in amount), all in accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC.

 



33 (c) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and since December 31,
2012, neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred (except, in
each case, as permitted by Section 5.2), any liabilities or obligations,
whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, whether
due or to become due, except (i) those liabilities fully accrued or reserved
against in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser and its

maintain a system of internal accounting controls effective to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Purchaser (i)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Purchasers internal controls over financial reporting.

reports, forms, schedules, registrations, statements and other documents,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file since December 31, 2012 with the Federal Reserve,
the OFI and the FDIC, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable

of its Subsidiaries.

becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, _provided_
, that no representation or warranty is made by Purchaser with respect to
information supplied in writing by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
specifically for inclusion therein. The portions of the Proxy Statement and

their respective properties or assets, or any present or former officer,
director or employee of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries in such
individuals capacity as such (and Purchaser is not aware of any basis for any
such Action), other than Actions that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Neither Purchaser nor any of its

submission.

referred to in clause (x) or (y) of this Section 5.3(a) would violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then Company may (and may authorize
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to) (x) furnish non-public
information with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Company Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to,
and no less favorable to Company than, those set forth in the Confidentiality

Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Company Acquisition
Proposal.

or is reasonably likely to result in, a Company Superior Proposal and such

continues to be a Company Superior Proposal after taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 5.3;

 



48 (ii) within three (3) Business Days after notice to Purchaser of receipt of a
Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.3(c) of this Agreement,

and shall contemporaneously provide an unredacted copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Company Superior
Proposal) to Purchaser; and

(iii) Company shall negotiate, and shall cause its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Purchaser during such notice period to the
extent Purchaser wishes to negotiate, to enable Purchaser to revise the terms
of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal.

In the event of any material change to the terms of such Company Superior
Proposal, Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Purchaser a
new written notice, the notice period shall have recommenced and Company shall
be required to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.3 with respect
to such new written notice, except that the deadline for such new written
notice shall be reduced to five (5) Business Days (rather than ten (10)
Business Days referenced in clause (ii) above).

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in Sections 5.3(a) and
(b), Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt) shall

Representatives receives (i) any Company Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to
a Company Acquisition Proposal) or to engage in negotiation that is reasonably
likely to lead to or that contemplates a Company Acquisition Proposal, in each
case together with the material terms and conditions of such Company
Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the Person making any such
Company Acquisition Proposal or request. Company shall keep Purchaser informed
(orally and in writing) in all material respects on a timely basis of the
status (including after the occurrence of any material amendment or
modification) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request and shall
provide Purchaser with copies of all material documentation and
correspondence related hereto. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Purchaser orally and
in writing if it determines to begin providing non-public information or
to engage in negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to Sections 5.3(a) and shall in no event begin providing such information or
engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

aspects of the proposal and the Person (or group of Persons) making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), (A) if consummated would be more favorable to the
shareholders of Company from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including taking into account any adjustment

organizational documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries in each
case, upon receipt of an undertaking, from such Indemnified Party to repay
such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was
not entitled to indemnification hereunder, arising out of matters existing or

obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for a period of six years
following the Effective Time by payment of such amount; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that (i) Purchaser may substitute therefor "tail" policies the

request that Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under
Companys existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time) in an amount not in excess of 175% of the amount of the aggregate

and officer insurance policies, including any tail policy, without
the written consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably

severance agreements in accordance with the terms of such agreements with such

control, severance, stock option or similar arrangement in excess of
limitations under 280G of the Code.

the remainder of the Company Termination Fee on the earlier of (i) the date of
execution of such agreement or (ii) consummation of such transaction; or 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i),

Section 7.1(c)(iii) or 7.3(b)(iii). The payment of the Company Termination
Fee shall be Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy and shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages.

(e) Each of Company and Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either Company or Purchaser fails

obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the amounts set forth in this
Section 7.3, the non-paying party shall pay to other party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this

obtained, no amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the shareholders of Company without such
further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or

time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer on

 



65  behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any
right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would
otherwise have hereunder.
