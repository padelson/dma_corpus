the unvested portion of each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (each an "Unvested Option" and together with the vested portion
of each outstanding option, a "Company Option") under the Company Option Plan
or otherwise shall be, in connection with the Merger, assumed by Parent. Each
Unvested Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
Company Option Plan and/or as provided in the respective option agreements
governing such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time except
that (A) such Unvested Option shall be exercisable (when vested) for that
number of whole shares of Common Stock of Parent equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming such
Unvested Option was then fully vested) multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock of
Parent, and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Unvested Option shall be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such Unvested Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent.   (ii) It is the intention of the parties that
the Unvested Options assumed by Parent qualify following the Effective Time
as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the
extent the Unvested Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent will use reasonable efforts to ensure
that such assumed Unvested Options maintain their status as incentive stock
options.   (iii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent will issue to each holder of an outstanding Unvested Option a
document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Unvested Option by
Parent.   (iv) To the extent Parent has waived the Closing condition
set forth in Section 6.3(u) hereof, with respect to any holder of a Company
Option, the unexercised, vested portion of any such Company Option
outstanding on the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time and
thereafter, represent the right to receive an amount of cash consideration
(without interest) equal to (A) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration
less the per share exercise price of such option multiplied by (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such option.   (g) Restricted
Stock. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company 
---------------- Restricted Stock then outstanding shall be assumed by Parent
in accordance with the provisions described below:   -6-     (i) At the
Effective Time, each outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock shall be,
in connection with the Merger, assumed by Parent. Each share of Company
Restricted Stock so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
Company Option Plan and/or as provided in the respective agreements governing
such Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that such Company Restricted Stock shall be exchanged for that number
of whole shares of Common Stock of Parent equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming such Company
Restricted Stock was then fully vested) multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock of
Parent. The shares of Common Stock of Parent issued in exchange for such
shares of Company Restricted Stock shall also be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificate representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
(A) be held in escrow by Parent until such shares are no longer subject to
such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition or (B) be
marked with appropriate legends in the discretion of Parent while such shares
are subject to such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition.   (ii) As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent will issue to each holder of outstanding Company Restricted
Stock a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company
Restricted Stock by Parent.   (h) Warrants. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company  -------- warrant not exercised prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and extinguished.   (i) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.
Each share of Common Stock of  --------------------------- Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of
Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares of Common Stock of Merger
Sub shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such shares of
Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (j) Adjustments to Option
Exchange Ratio. The Option Exchange 
------------------------------------ Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully
the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Capital
Stock), recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Capital
Stock that occurs or has a record date after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.   1.7 Dissenting Shares.  -----------------   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares
of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected
appraisal or dissenters\' rights for such shares in accordance with Delaware
Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such appraisal or dissenters\' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not
be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled
to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law.   -7-     (b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(a) above, if any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock who is otherwise entitled to
exercise dissenters\' rights under Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such dissenters\' rights,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6
hereof, without interest on the payment and subject to the provisions of
Section 1.8 and Article VII hereof, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares.   (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for the exercise of dissenters\' rights in
respect of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law (including without
limitation instruments concerning appraisal or dissenters\' rights) and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for the exercise of dissenters\' rights
in respect of any shares of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle or
settle any such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that
Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any
Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have
been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or
(ii) incurs any other costs or expenses in respect of any Dissenting Shares
(excluding payments for such shares) (together "Dissenting Share Payments"),
Parent shall be entitled to recover under the terms of Article VII hereof the
amount of such Dissenting Share Payments.   1.8 Exchange Procedures;
Surrender of Certificates. 
----------------------------------------------   (a) Exchange Agent.
Computershare Trust Company (or such agent as Parent  -------------- shall
reasonably appoint) shall serve as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in

upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)

the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent (as defined in Article VII hereof).
The Escrow Amount so deposited with the Escrow Agent shall be available to
compensate Parent as provided in Article VII hereof. From the Closing and

from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent
solely the right to receive the applicable consideration set forth in Section
1.6 hereof.   (d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this  ------------ Section 1.8 hereof, none of the Exchange Agent, the

have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration

Agreement. In addition, each of Parent and Company and their respective
counsel shall coordinate with each other in preparing and exchanging such
information and promptly provide each other with copies of all filings,
presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) with
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that with respect to any such
filing, presentation or submission, Company and Parent and their respective
counsel need not supply each other with copies (or in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that Counsel advises the party that
disclosure should be limited or prohibited to avoid a violation of any law,
treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity.   (c) Notification.
Each of Parent and Company will notify counsel  ------------ for the other
party promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any officials of any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments

for the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental

coordinate and cooperate with one another in connection with any press
releases issued in connection with the receipt of any comment or request by

previously executed Joint  ----------------------- Defense Agreement between
counsel for Parent and counsel for Company shall supercede the terms of this
Agreement. This Agreement and the Joint Defense Agreement shall be construed
as complementary, and the previously executed Joint Defense Agreement shall
be interpreted to embody the general principles of this Agreement.   (e)
Limitation on Divestiture. Notwithstanding anything in this 
------------------------- Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or Company or any Subsidiary
or affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its
affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property,
or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets,

plan(s) and/or program(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of

resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective as
of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. In the event that
distribution or rollover of assets from the trust of a 401(k) plan which is
terminated is reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any
participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon the Company or
plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Parent as soon as possible following the date of this
Agreement. The Company shall terminate any and all group health and welfare

------------ shares of Company Restricted Stock, the Company shall accelerate
the vesting of such securities in accordance with any applicable acceleration
provisions set forth in such holder\'s stock option and restricted stock
agreements. In addition to any acceleration pursuant to the preceding
sentence, with respect to each holder of a Company Option and/or Company
Restricted Stock, the Company shall accelerate the vesting of 50% of the
aggregate unvested portion of such securities immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to
effectuate such acceleration and to facilitate the exercise of such Company

therein, subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of the unaudited
financial statements, which such adjustments will not be material in amount
or significance.   5.21 Cash Dividend. Immediately prior to the Closing, the
Company shall pay  ------------- a cash dividend to its stockholders as set

representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this

-------------------   (a) Escrow Fund. At the Effective Time the holders of
Company Capital  ----------- Stock entitled to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof (the "Indemnifying Stockholders") will not
receive the Escrow Amount but such stockholders will be deemed to have
consented to the deposit with the Escrow Agent (as defined below) of the
Escrow Amount without any act required on the part of any such stockholder.
Instead, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount,
without any act required on the part of any stockholder, will be deposited by
Parent with an escrow agent acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to
constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set
forth herein and at Parent\'s cost and expense. The portion of the Escrow
Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock shall be
determined with reference to each such stockholder\'s Pro Rata Escrow Basis.
The Escrow Amount shall be contributed entirely out of the
Merger Consideration payable upon the Merger in respect of  
-48-    the Company Capital Stock. The Escrow Fund is available to
compensate Parent and its officers, directors and affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation (each, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses, and expenses of investigation and defenses (hereinafter
individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") paid, incurred, accrued or
sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them, directly or indirectly
as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty
of the Company contained in Article II herein as of the date of this
Agreement or as of the Closing Date, as though then made (except to the
extent that such representation or warranty speaks as of an earlier date),
(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant
contained in this Agreement, (iii) any Dissenting Share Payments, (iv) any
claim made by any person that such person is or was entitled (by contract
or otherwise) to receive any amount or property in such person\'s capacity
(or asserted capacity) as a holder of equity interests in the Company or
contingent equity interests or as a beneficiary of any rights in excess of
the consideration set forth in this Agreement by virtue of or as a result of
the Merger, other than any claim described in clause (iii) above, (v) any
claims made by foreign employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
whether or not disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule, (vi) any claims made by
Parametric Technology Corporation or its subsidiaries relating to the Company
Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, any claims related to
trade secret misappropriation, whether or not disclosed on the Disclosure
Schedule, (vii) the Acceleration or (viii) the Cash Dividend; provided,
however, that to the extent that a specific Liability (as defined in Section
2.7 hereof) is used to reduce the amount of the Cash Dividend (as calculated
pursuant to Schedule 5.21 hereof), such Liability shall not be considered a
Loss for purposes of this Article VII. Parent and the Company each
acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved
contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at the
Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the aggregate Merger
consideration. Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company for
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if the Merger does not
close.   No Indemnified Party may recover any Losses unless and until one or
more Officer\'s Certificates identifying a Loss or Losses in excess of
$100,000 in the aggregate (the "Threshold Amount") has or have been delivered
to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7.2(d) hereof, in which case such
Indemnified Party  -------------- shall be entitled to recover all Losses
(including the Threshold Amount) so identified to the extent then available
in the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled
to recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to,
any and all claims or payments made with respect to (i) all Losses incurred
pursuant to clauses (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of this Section 7.2(a), or (ii)
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct.   (b) Escrow
Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods. 
-------------------------------------------------------------- Subject to the
following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately
following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., (California
Time) on the Expiration Date (the "Escrow Period"); provided that the Escrow
Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount (or some portion
thereof), that is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent (subject to
reduction as may be determined by arbitration of the matter as provided in
Section 7.2(f) hereof in the event of the objection of the Stockholder
Representative (as defined in Section 7.2(h) hereof) in   -49-    the
manner provided in Section 7.2(e) hereof) to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination
of such Escrow Period and to the extent specified in any Officer\'s
Certificate (as defined below) delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
termination of such Escrow Period. As soon as all such claims have been
resolved, the Escrow Agent shall transfer to the stockholders of the Company,
pursuant to written instructions by Parent, the remaining portion of the
Escrow Fund, if any, not required to satisfy such claims. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, on the third business day following the date that is twelve months
from the Closing Date, Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to
distribute 50% of the Escrow Amount remaining (and not subject to any
unsatisfied claims under any Officer\'s Certificate(s) delivered to the
Escrow Agent prior to the date of the Early Release) in the Escrow Fund to
the stockholders (the "Early Release"); provided, however, that there shall
be no Early Release if an Indemnified Party(ies) has previously submitted an
Officer\'s Certificate(s) claiming an aggregate of $5,000,000 or more in
Losses. Deliveries of Escrow Amounts to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall be made with reference to each
stockholder\'s Pro Rata Escrow Basis.   (c) Protection of Escrow Fund. The
Escrow Agent shall hold and  ------------------------- safeguard the Escrow
Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of the
Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof. All income earned on
the cash in the Escrow Fund, if any, shall become part of, and be held as an
additional portion of the Escrow Fund in proportion to each
applicable stockholder\'s Pro Rata Escrow Basis, subject to the tax
distribution authorized below. It is expressly agreed and understood that the
Escrow Fund shall, until distributed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, constitute assets of the Parent for tax purposes,
provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall not distribute any amounts
from the Escrow Fund except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement or pursuant to any final and nonappealable order of a court
of competent jurisdiction with respect to payment. Accordingly, for tax
purposes, the assets and all earnings on the assets shall be considered owned
by the Parent until distributed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, and reported as such for all tax reporting purposes.
Interest shall accrue on Parent\'s obligation to Company stockholders under
the Escrow Fund arrangement at a rate equal to the rate at which interest is
earned on the amounts in escrow. Parent will report such accrued interest to
the Company stockholders as required by income tax reporting rules (including
the original issue discount rules). The Escrow Agent is hereby directed to
pay to the Company stockholders out of the Escrow Fund, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the reporting of such accrued interest to such Company
stockholders, a tax distribution equal to 40% of the amounts reported
to Company stockholders. Within 30 days after the Closing Date, the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent a properly executed, valid
IRS Form W-8 or W-9 and such other tax reporting documents that the Parent
may reasonably request, for each Company stockholder.   (d) Claims Upon
Escrow Fund. Subject to Section 7.2(e) hereof, upon 
----------------------- receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before
the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer of
Parent (an "Officer\'s Certificate"): (A) stating that an Indemnified Party
has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to
pay or accrue Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual
items of Losses included in the amount so stated,   -50-    the date
each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such reasonably
anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or covenant or otherwise to which such item is related, the Escrow
Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(e) hereof, transfer to
Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, funds held in
the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses. Such payments from the
Escrow Fund will be made with reference to each stockholder\'s Pro Rata
Escrow Basis.   (e) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any 
-------------------- Officer\'s Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate
copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative
and for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent
shall make no transfer to Parent of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section
7.2(d) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written
authorization from the Stockholder Representative to make such transfer.
After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall
transfer the funds from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 7.2(d)
hereof, provided that no such transfer may be made if the Stockholder
Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the
Officer\'s Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.   (f)
Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration. 
------------------------------------   (i) In case the Stockholder
Representative shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any
Officer\'s Certificate as provided in Section 7.2(e) hereof, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall
be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on any such memorandum and distribute funds from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof.   (ii) If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the Stockholder
Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the
damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall
be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators
shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce
the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity,
adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant
information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the
dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery
and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees
and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or equity, should
the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three
arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer\'s
Certificate shall be binding   -51-    and conclusive upon the parties
to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(e) hereof, the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and
make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.
Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of
fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or
order awarded by the arbitrators.   (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered
by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such
arbitration shall be held in Marin County, California under the rules then in
effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section
7.2(f), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof
stated in the Officer\'s Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to
be the prevailing party in the event that the arbitrators award Parent an
amount equal to at least the sum of one-half (1/2) of the disputed amount
plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the Stockholder Representative
shall be deemed to be the prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an
arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administrative costs of the arbitration, and the expenses, including without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and costs, incurred by the other party
to the arbitration.   (g) Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes
aware of a  ------------------ third-party claim that Parent reasonably
believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall notify
the Stockholder Representative of such claim, and the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in any
defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
control the defense of all such claims and to settle any such claim;
provided, however, that no settlement of any such claim with third-
party claimants shall be the sole determining factor of the amount of any
claim against the Escrow Fund, except with the consent of the
Stockholder Representative. In the event that the Stockholder Representative
has consented to any such settlement and acknowledged that the claim is a
valid claim against the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed to the claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund in an
amount equal to such settlement.   (h) Stockholder Representative; Power of
Attorney.  ---------------------------------------------   (i) In the event
that the Merger is approved, effective upon such vote, and without further
act of any stockholder, Irwin Jungreis, shall be appointed as agent and
attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholder Representative") for each stockholder of
the Company (except such stockholders, if any, as shall have exercised their
dissenters\' rights under Delaware Law), for and on behalf of stockholders of
the Company, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
delivery to Parent of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by
Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take
all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Stockholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be
changed by the stockholders of the Company from time to time upon not less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided that
the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-
thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity
of the substituted   -52-    agent. Any vacancy in the position of
Stockholder Representative may be filled by approval of the holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not
receive compensation for his or her services. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each
of the stockholders of the Company.   (ii) The Stockholder Representative
shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder
Representative in good faith, absent gross negligence. The stockholders of
the Company on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow
Fund shall severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholder Representative\'s duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by
the Stockholder Representative.   (i) Actions of the Stockholder
Representative. A decision, act, 
----------------------------------------- consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute a decision of all the
stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to
them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each of such stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent
may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each such stockholder of the Company. The Escrow Agent and
Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative.   (j) Escrow Agent\'s Duties. 
---------------------   (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for
the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as
set forth in any additional written escrow instructions that the Escrow Agent
may receive after the date of this Agreement that are signed by an officer of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be
protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably
believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper
party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith, provided
that the Escrow Agent has exercised reasonable care in the selection of such
counsel.   (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized
to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by
any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law or
the arbitrators, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey
orders, judgments or decrees of any court or the arbitrators. In case the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any
court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or
to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any  
-53-    such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
jurisdiction.   (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect
on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing
or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any
documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder absent gross negligence
or willful misconduct.   (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to
this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent absent
gross negligence or willful misconduct.   (v) In performing any duties
under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for
damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur
any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good
faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument,
including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement
that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the
Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations,
or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the
Escrow Agent may consult with the legal counsel in connection with Escrow
Agent\'s duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act
taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the
advice of counsel provided that the Escrow Agent has exercised reasonable
care in the selection of such counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible
for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting
or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.   (vi) If
any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any
other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or
conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and funds held in escrow and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings. In such event, the Escrow
Agent will not be liable for damage.   Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at
its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer
and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and funds
held in escrow, except all cost, expenses, charges and reasonable attorneys
fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action and which
the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action,
the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all
obligations and liabilities imposed by the terms of this Agreement.   (vii)
The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and
severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable
costs of investigation, attorneys fees, and disbursements that may be imposed
on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection   -54-    with
the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including but not
limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving
its subject matter.   (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon
giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided,
however, that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent, which shall be accomplished as
follows: the parties shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a
successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice.
If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time,
the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent
authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor escrow
agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and
it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties,
rights, powers and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally
named as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further
duties and liability under this Agreement.   (k) Fees. All fees of the
Escrow Agent for performance of its  ---- duties hereunder shall be paid by
Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for
services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary
services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions
of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders
any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a
substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if
the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation
pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be
reasonably compensated by Parent for such extraordinary services
and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, and expenses occasioned by
such default, delay, controversy or litigation.   (l) Escrow as the Sole
Remedy. The Escrow Fund shall be the sole  ------------------------- and
exclusive source of satisfaction of any claim made by the Indemnified Parties
for any Losses resulting from the matters set forth in this Article VII and
the Indemnified Parties shall have no other right of indemnification
against the Indemnifying Stockholders with respect to any other information,
documents or materials furnished to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors; provided that nothing
herein shall limit any remedy of an Indemnified Party for fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, and nothing herein shall
limit the liability of the Company for any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, nothing shall prohibit Parent from seeking
and obtaining recourse against the Company\'s stockholders, or any of them,
in the event that Parent issues to the Company\'s stockholders, or any of
them, more than the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is
entitled pursuant to Article I of this Agreement.   -55-     ARTICLE

permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which
order, decree or ruling is final and nonappealable;   (d) by Parent if there
shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,

portion of the business or assets of the Company or Parent;   (e) by

would not then be satisfied; provided, that if such inaccuracy in the
Company\'s representations and warranties or breach by the Company is curable
by the Company through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts,
then Parent may only terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) if
the breach is not cured within ten (10) days following the date of written
notice from Parent of such breach (but no cure period shall be required for a
breach which by its nature cannot be cured); or   (g) by Parent, if a
Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred after the date of this
Agreement, and such Company Material Adverse Effect has not been cured within
thirty (30) calendar days; provided, however, that no cure period shall be
required for a Company Material Adverse Effect which by its nature cannot be
cured.   Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1, it shall be sufficient for such action to be authorized by the
Board of Directors (as applicable) of the party taking such action.   8.2
Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement 
--------------------- as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers,

full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.   8.3

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL
