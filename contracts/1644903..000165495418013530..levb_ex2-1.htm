and no later than twenty (20) days in the fifty ninth (59th) month of the
Marking Period, Parent's Chief Financial Officer (or other financial officer
designated by Parent) shall deliver to the Company Members a certificate
(each, a "Net Revenue Certificate") setting forth (x) the calculation of
the Net Revenues for Sub LLC for each applicable Marking Period, and (y) the
aggregate Net Revenues for Sub LLC which shall be determined by adding the
applicable Marking Period's Net Revenues with all Net Revenues set forth in
any prior Net Revenue Certificates for any prior Marking Periods (x and y,
collectively, "Aggregate Net Revenues").

 

 

 (ii) First Earnout Shares. Upon determination of the Aggregate
Net Revenues as of the end of the First Marking Period, the Parent shall
issue the First Earnout Shares to the Company Members in such amounts as set
forth on Exhibit B. By way of illustration, in the event the Aggregate Net
Revenues during the First Marking Period are (a) $15,000,000, then the number
of the First Earnout Shares shall be 2,859,375 (.190625 X $15,000,000),
or (b) $25,000,000, then the Parent shall issue 4,289,063 shares, which is
equal to the number of First Earnout Shares of 3,812,500 (.190625 X
$20,000,000) and the number of Second Earnout Shares of 476,563 ($5,000,000 X

 (iii) Second Earnout Shares. Upon determination of the Aggregate
Net Revenues as of the end of the Second Marking Period, the Parent shall
issue the Second Earnout Shares to the Company Members in such amounts as set
forth on Exhibit B. By way of illustration, in the event the Aggregate Net
Revenues during the First Marking Period was $25,000,000 and the Aggregate
Net Revenues during the Second Marking Period is $65,000,000, then the
Parent shall issue 3,574,219 shares, which is the sum of (a) zero
with respect to the First Earnout Shares which were by Parent following the
First Marking Period), (b) 3,335,937.5 with respect to the Second Earnout
Shares (35,000,000 (the Aggregate Net Revenues during the Second Marking
Period minus the Aggregate Net Revenues during the First Marking Period) X
.0953125), and (c) 238,281.25 with respect to the Third Earnout Shares

 (v) Fourth Earnout Shares. Upon determination of the Aggregate
Net Revenues as of the end of the Fourth Marking Period, the Parent shall
issue the Fourth Earnout Shares to the Company Members in the amount set
forth on Exhibit B. 

 

 

 (vi) Total Potential Earnout Shares. For clarification purposes, all the
Earnout Shares shall be issued by the Parent to such Company Members as set
forth in this Section 2.06(c) when the Aggregate Net Revenues equal
$300,000,000.

 

 

 (vii) Subdivisions and Combinations. If the Parent shall at any time after
the Closing Date but prior to the Marking Period End Date subdivide
its outstanding Parent Common Stock, by split-up or otherwise, or combine
its outstanding Parent Common Stock, the number of Earnout Shares as to which
the Company Members may have a right to receive under this Section 2.06(c)
as of the date of such subdivision, split-up or combination shall forthwith
be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision, or proportionately
decreased in the case of a combination.

 

 

 (d) Merger Sub Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the respective shareholders or members thereof, each membership
interest of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become a membership interest
in the Company (and the membership interests of the Company into which the
membership interests of Merger Sub are so converted shall be the
only membership interests of the Company that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). Each certificate, if
any, evidencing ownership of membership interests of Merger Sub
will evidence ownership of the Company Membership Interest.

 

 

 (e) Company Membership Interests. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the respective shareholders or members thereof, each Company Membership
Interest issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive, subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.06 (a) ,
without surrender of the certificate, if any, representing such
Company Membership Interest, the Merger Consideration.

 

 

 Section 2.07 Effect of Secondary Merger on Stock and LLC Interests. At
the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Secondary Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Sub LLC, the
Surviving Company, the Company or the respective shareholders or members,
as applicable, thereof, (a) each membership interest of the
Surviving Company that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Secondary Merger
and without further action on the part of the sole member of the Surviving
Company, be cancelled and extinguished for no consideration therefor, and (b)
each membership interest of Sub LLC outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Secondary Merger and without
further action on the part of the sole member of Sub LLC, remain unchanged
and continue to remain outstanding as a membership interest in the
Surviving LLC.

 

 

 

 

 

 

17

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Section 2.08 Parent Payment Shares.

 

 

 (a) As a condition precedent to Closing, each Company Member shall
enter into a Leak-Out Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D
hereto with respect to the First Tranche Shares and the Second
Tranche Shares. As a condition precedent to the issuance of any
Earnout Shares, each Company Member entitled to the Earnout Shares
will enter into the Leak-Out Agreement.

 

 

 (b) The Parent Payment Shares will be issued in a transaction exempt
from registration under the Securities Act by reason of Section
4(a)(2) thereof and may not be re-offered or resold other than in conformity
with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other
applicable rules and regulations or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The
certificates evidencing the Parent Payment Shares when issued shall include
legends contained in the Voting Proxy Agreement, and the Leak-Out Agreement,
as applicable, in addition to a legend substantially in the following form

 

 

 "THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THESE SECURITIES IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION. THESE
SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY BE REOFFERED AND SOLD ONLY IF SO
REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE."

 

 

 The legend set forth in this Section 2.08(b) shall be removed by Parent
from any certificate or book-entry security entitlement evidencing Parent
Payment Shares upon delivery by the holder thereof to Parent of a written
request to that effect if at the time of such written request (i) a
registration statement under the Securities Act is at that time in effect
with respect to the legended security or (ii) the legended security can be
freely transferred in a transaction in compliance with Rule 144 under
the Securities Act without such a registration statement being in effect and
that such transfer will not jeopardize the exemption or exemptions from
registration pursuant to which Parent issued the shares of Parent Payment
Shares, and, in the case of (ii), upon the reasonable request of Parent's
transfer agent, the holder of such Parent Payment Shares (x) executes and
delivers a representation letter that includes customary
representations regarding the holding requirements and whether such holder is
an "affiliate" for purposes of Rule 144, and/or (y) secures the delivery to
Parent's transfer agent of an opinion by counsel, in form and substance
satisfactory to Parent, that such security can be freely transferred in a
public sale without registration pursuant to an available exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and that such transfer
will not jeopardize the exemption or exemptions from registration pursuant to
which Parent issued the shares of Parent Payment Shares.

 

 

 

 (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Membership Interests. The
agreement to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement in exchange for the Company Membership Interests shall be
deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Membership Interests, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Company or the Surviving Company of Company Membership
Interests which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, the certificates representing the
Company Membership Interests are presented to the Company or the
Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled without
any additional consideration to any Company Member, it being understood by
the parties that the sole consideration to be received by the Company Members
at the Effective Time shall be the contractual right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

18

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Surviving LLC, or
any party hereto shall be liable to a Company Member for any amount paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

 

 Section 2.09 Withholding Taxes. The Company, the Parent, and the
Surviving Company, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
any provision of federal, local or foreign tax Law or under any legal
requirements or applicable orders. Parent shall give the Company Member
reasonable prior notice of any amount to be withheld and the Company
Member shall be entitled to review, comment upon, and request
reasonable changes to such withholding and Parent shall promptly make any
such changes unless Parent reasonably objects to such changes. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

 

 2.10 Taking of Further Action. If at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement including, without limitation, to vest the Surviving
Company with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, or to vest Parent
with full right, title and possession to all of the Company Membership
Interests, then each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the managers,
officers and directors of each of the Surviving Company and Parent are fully
authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

 

 

 2.11 Tax Treatment. The Merger and Secondary Merger are intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of
the Code pursuant to the principles set forth in Revenue Ruling 2001-46, and
this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3.
No party hereto shall take any action or position before a Governmental
Authority which is inconsistent with the intent to treat the Merger and
Secondary Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code unless otherwise required pursuant to
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.
Further, each party hereto shall cause all Tax Returns relating to the
Mergers to be filed on the basis of treating the Merger and Secondary Merger
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code,
unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Neither Parent nor the Company has Knowledge
of any facts or circumstances or will take or omit to take any action if such
fact, circumstance, action or omission would cause the Merger and Secondary
Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code (e.g., as a result of a failure to meet
the continuity of business enterprise requirement of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(d), or otherwise).

any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to limit
the adverse effect upon the Company and the Parent, their respective
subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or that would
reasonably be expected to result after the consummation of the Mergers, from
the failure to obtain such consent.

in respect of such Losses or any of the events or circumstances giving rise
to such Losses, in each case, net of any costs or expenses incurred in

the 30-day period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice
by delivery of a written notice of objection containing a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances supporting

set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

 

 (c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall deliver
an Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section

Notice, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such claims. If Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party should so agree,

Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand for
indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, Parent shall notify the
Company Members of such claim, and the Company Members shall have the right
to defend against the Third Party Claim provided that (i) the Company Members
notify Parent in writing within fifteen (15) days after Parent has given
notice of the Third Party Claim that Indemnifying Parties will
indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties from and against the entirety of
any Losses the Parent Indemnified Parties may pay resulting from, arising
out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the Third Party Claim,

52

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (c) If Parent conducts the defense of any such claim, whether by
reason that the Company Members chooses not to conduct the defense of
such Third Party Claim or by reason that the Company Members fails
to qualify to conduct such defense in accordance with Section 8.07, Parent
shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and
to settle, any such claim;provided, however, that (i) except without the
consent of the Company Member, no settlement of any Third Party Claim with
third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses the
Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover pursuant to
the indemnification provisions of Article VIII relating to such matter, and
(ii) the Company Members shall be permitted to participate (at the sole cost
and expense of the Company Members) in the defense of such Third Party Claim
and Parent will consult with the Company Members in respect of all material
developments and decisions, including settlement offers, with respect to such
Third Party Claim. In the event that the Company Members have consented to
any such settlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall not have any power or

with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
claims of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement;provided, however, that (i) this Section 8.08
shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party (and this Article VIII
shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of such Indemnifying
Party) in connection with claims based on fraud committed by such
Indemnifying Party regardless of the capacity in which such Indemnifying
Party committed such fraud.

 

 

 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any Indemnified
Party to pursue remedies under any other Transaction Document against
the parties thereto.

 d. Voluntary Termination. If the Executive terminates the
Executive\'s employment on the Executive\'s own volition prior to the
expiration of the Term of this Agreement, including any renewals thereof,
such termination shall constitute a voluntary termination and in such event
the Executive shall be limited to the same rights and benefits as provided in
connection with a termination for Cause as provided in Section 6c.

 

 

 

 7. Covenant Not To Compete and Non-Disclosure of Information.

 

 

 

 a. Covenant Not To Compete. The Executive acknowledges and recognizes the
highly competitive nature of the Company\'s Business and the goodwill,
continued patronage, and the names and addresses of the Company\'s Clients
(as hereinafter defined) constitute a substantial asset of the Company having
been acquired through considerable time, money and effort. Accordingly, in
consideration of the execution of this Agreement, and as except as may
specifically otherwise approved by the Parent Board, the Executive agrees to
the following:

 

 

 

 (1) That during the Restricted Period (as hereinafter defined) and
within the Restricted Area (as hereinafter defined), the Executive will not,
individually or in conjunction with others, directly or indirectly, engage in
any Business Activities (as hereinafter defined), whether as an officer,
director, proprietor, employer, partner, independent contractor, investor

nine one hundreds percent (4.99%) of the outstanding capital stock of
a publicly traded company), consultant, advisor, agent or otherwise.

 

 

 

 (2) That during the Restricted Period and within the Restricted Area,
the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, compete with the Company by

a business relationship with the Company at the time during the Restricted
Period to discontinue or reduce the extent of such relationship with the
Company.

 

 

 

 (3) That during the Restricted Period and within the Restricted Area,
the Executive will not (A) directly or indirectly recruit, solicit
or otherwise influence any employee or agent of the Company to discontinue
such employment or agency relationship with the Company, or (B) employ or
seek to employ, or cause or permit any business which competes directly or
indirectly with the Business Activities of the Company (the
"Competitive Business") to employ or seek to employ for any Competitive
Business any person who is then (or was at any time within two (2) years
prior to the date Executive or the Competitive Business employs or seeks to
employ such person) employed by the Company.

concerning the Company\'s sources, products, services, pricing, formula,
training methods, development, technical information, marketing activities
and procedures, credit and financial data concerning the Company and/or the
Company\'s Clients, and (the "Proprietary Information") are valuable,
special and unique assets of the Company, access to and knowledge of which
are essential to the performance of the Executive hereunder. In light of the
highly competitive nature of the industry in which the Company\'s
Business is conducted, the Executive agrees that all
Proprietary Information, heretofore or in the future obtained by the
Executive as a result of the Executive\'s association with the Company
shall be considered confidential.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    EXHIBIT E TO MERGER AGREEMENT

 

 

 

 In recognition of this fact, the Executive agrees that the
Executive, during the Restricted Period, will not use or disclose any of
such Proprietary Information for the Executive\'s own purposes or for
the benefit of any person or other entity or organization (except
the Company) under any circumstances unless such Proprietary Information has
been publicly disclosed generally or, unless upon written advice of legal
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Executive is legally
required to disclose such Proprietary Information. Documents (as hereinafter
defined) prepared by the Executive or that come into the
Executive\'s possession during the Executive\'s association with the Company
are and remain the property of the Company, and when this
Agreement terminates, such Documents shall be returned to the Company at
the Company\'s principal place of business, as provided in the
Notice provision (Section 10) of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 c. Documents. "Documents" shall mean all original written, recorded, or
graphic matters whatsoever, and any and all copies thereof, including, but
not limited to: papers; books; records; tangible things; correspondence;
communications; telex messages; memoranda; work-papers; reports; affidavits;
statements; formulas; summaries; analyses; evaluations; client records and

manuals; brochures; publications; directories; industry lists; schedules;
price lists; client lists; statistical records; training manuals;
computer printouts; books of account, records and invoices
reflecting business operations; all things similar to any of the
foregoing however denominated. In all cases where originals are
not available, the term "Documents" shall also mean identical copies of
original documents or non-identical copies thereof.

 

 

 

 d.   Company\'s Clients. The "Company\'s Clients" shall be deemed to be
any persons, partnerships, companies, professional associations or
other organizations for or with whom the Company or Cure, prior to the
Mergers, has performed Business Activities, including, but not limited to,
suppliers or vendors with whom the Company or Cure, prior to the Mergers, has
done or is endeavoring to do business.

 

 

 

 e. Restrictive Period. The "Restrictive Period" shall be deemed to be one
(1) year following termination of this Agreement.

the Business, and any additional activities which the Company or any of
its affiliates may engage in during any portion of the twelve (12) months
prior to the termination of Executive\'s employment.

 

 

 

 h. Covenants as Essential Elements of this Agreement. It is understood
by and between the parties hereto that the foregoing covenants contained in
Sections 7a and b are essential elements of this Agreement, and that but for
the agreement by the Executive to comply with such covenants, the Company
would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement. Such covenants by the
Executive shall be construed to be agreements independent of any other
provisions of this Agreement. The existence of any other claim or cause
of action, whether predicated on any other provision in this Agreement, or
otherwise, as a result of the relationship between the parties shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against the
Executive. To the extent that the covenants contained in this Section 7 may
later be deemed by a court to be too broad to be enforced with respect
to their duration or with respect to any particular activity or geographic
area, the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration or scope of the provision, and to add or delete specific words or
phrases to or from the provision. The provision as modified shall then be
enforced.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    EXHIBIT E TO MERGER AGREEMENT

 

 

 

 i. Survival After Termination of Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the covenants in Sections 7a
and b shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Executive\'s
employment with the Company.

 

 

 

 j. Remedies.

 

 

 

 (1) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company\'s remedy at
law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 7a
or b herein would be inadequate and the breach shall be per se deemed as
causing irreparable harm to the Company. In recognition of this fact, in the
event of a breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Section 7a or
b, the Executive agrees that, in addition to any remedy at law available to
the Company, including, but not limited to monetary damages, all rights of
the Executive to payment or otherwise under this Agreement and all amounts
then or thereafter due to the Executive from the Company under this Agreement
may be terminated and the Company, without posting any bond, shall be
entitled to obtain, and the Executive agrees not to oppose the Company\'s
request for equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary
restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable
remedy which may then be available to the Company.

 

 

 

 (2) The Executive acknowledges that the granting of a temporary
injunction, temporary restraining order or permanent injunction
merely prohibiting the use of Proprietary Information would not be
an adequate remedy upon breach or threatened breach of Section 7a or b and
consequently agrees, upon proof of any such breach, to the granting of
injunctive relief prohibiting any form of competition with the Company.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened
breach.

 

 

 

 8. Indemnification. The Executive shall be covered by the Articles of
Organization and Operating Agreement of the Company with respect to
matters occurring on or prior to the date of termination of the
Executive\'s employment with the Company, subject to all the provisions of
North Carolina and Federal law, the Articles of Organization the Company and
the Operating Agreement of the Company then in effect. Such reasonable
expenses, including attorneys\' fees, that may be covered by these
indemnification provisions shall be paid by the Company on a current basis in
accordance with such provision, the Company\'s Articles of Organization,
Operating Agreement and North Carolina law. To the extent that any such
payments by the Company pursuant to these provisions may be subject to
repayment by the Executive pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of
Organization and/or Operating Agreement, or pursuant to North Carolina or
Federal law, such repayment shall be due and payable by the Executive to
the Company within twelve (12) months after the termination of
all proceedings, if any, which relate to such repayment and to
the Company\'s affairs for the period prior to the date of termination of
the Executive\'s employment with the Company and as to which Executive has
been covered by such applicable provisions.

 

 

 

 9. Withholding. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments
required to be made by the Company hereunder to the Executive or
the Executive\'s estate or beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding
of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the
Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to any
applicable law or regulation. In lieu of withholding such amounts, the
Company may accept other arrangements pursuant to which it is satisfied that
such tax and other payroll obligations will be satisfied in a manner
complying with applicable law or regulation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    EXHIBIT E TO MERGER AGREEMENT

 

 

 

 10. Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under the terms
of this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if sent postage
prepaid by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested; by
overnight delivery; by courier; or by confirmed telecopy, in the case of the
Executive to the Executive\'s last place of business or residence as shown on
the records of the Company, or in the case of the Company to its principal
office as set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement, or at
such other place as it may designate.

 

 

 

 11. Waiver. Unless agreed in writing, the failure of either party, at any
time, to require performance by the other of any provisions hereunder shall
not affect its right thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall a waiver by
either party of any breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a
waiver of any other preceding or succeeding breach of any term or provision
of this Agreement. No extension of time for the performance of any obligation
or act shall be deemed to be an extension of time for the performance of any
other obligation or act hereunder.

 

 

 

 12. Completeness and Modification. This Agreement constitutes the
entire understanding between the parties hereto superseding all prior
and contemporaneous agreements or understandings among the parties hereto
concerning the Agreement. This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded
or canceled, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by the
parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the party to be charged.

 

 

 

 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
shall constitute but one agreement.

 

 

 

 14. Binding Effect/Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
the parties hereto, their heirs, legal representatives, successors
and assigns. This Agreement shall not be assignable by the Executive but
shall be assignable by the Company in connection with the sale, transfer or
other disposition of its business or to any of the Company\'s affiliates
controlled by or under common control with the Company.

 

 

 

 15. Governing Law. This Agreement shall become valid when executed

other political subdivision in which the Executive is located.

 

 

 

 16. Further Assurances. All parties hereto shall execute and deliver such
other instruments and do such other acts as may be necessary to carry out the
intent and purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 17. Headings. The headings of the sections are for convenience only and
shall not control or affect the meaning or construction or limit the scope
or intent of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    EXHIBIT E TO MERGER AGREEMENT

 

 

 

 18. Survival. Any termination of this Agreement shall not, however, affect
the ongoing provisions of this Agreement which shall survive
such termination in accordance with their terms.

 

 

 

 19. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part,
of any covenant, promise or undertaking, or any section,
subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word or of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remaining portions thereof.

 

 

 

 20. Enforcement. Should it become necessary for any party to institute
legal action to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the successful party will be awarded reasonable attorneys\' fees at
all trial and appellate levels, expenses and costs.

Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, shall be the venue and exclusive proper
forum in which to adjudicate any case or controversy arising either, directly
or indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement and the parties
further agree that, in the event of litigation arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement in these courts, they will not contest or
challenge the jurisdiction or venue of these courts.

 

 

 

 22. Construction. This Agreement shall be construed within the fair meaning
of each of its terms and not against the party drafting the document.

 

 

 

 23. Role of Counsel. The Executive acknowledges his understanding that
this Agreement was prepared at the request of the Company by Pearlman Law
Group LLP, its counsel, and that such firm did not represent the Executive in
conjunction with this Agreement or any of the related transactions. The
Executive, as further evidenced by his signature below, acknowledges that he
has had the opportunity to obtain the advice of independent counsel of his
choosing prior to his execution of this Agreement and that he has availed
himself of this opportunity to the extent he deemed necessary and advisable.

 EXHIBIT G-1 TO MERGER AGREEMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

  Opinion of Pearlman Law Group LLP

 

 

 

 

 

1. The Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the state of North Carolina. The Parent Group are each a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the state of North Carolina. The Parent Group are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Parent.

 

 

2. Each of the Parent and the Parent Group has full corporate power and authority to enter into the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Parent and/or the Parent Group is a party, to carry out its obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery by Parent of the Merger Agreement and any other Transaction Document to which Parent is a party, the performance by Parent of its obligations thereunder and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of Parent. The Merger Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Company) the Merger Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms. When each other Transaction Document to which Parent is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by Parent (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding obligation of Parent enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

 

 

3. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent of the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not: (a) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any provision of the articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of Parent; (b) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Law or Governmental Order applicable to Parent; or (c), require the consent, notice or other action by any Person under any Contract to which Parent is a party is required. No consent, approval, Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to Parent in connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, except for the Shareholder Approval, the NYSE Listing Approval, and such consents, approvals, Permits, Governmental Orders, declarations, filings or notices which, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

4. To our Knowledge there are no Actions pending or threatened against or by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent that challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. To our Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstances exist that may give rise or serve as a basis for any such Action.

 

 

5. The shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration, prior to issuance, will have been, duly authorized by all necessary corporate actions and, when so issued in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be issued in violation of the pre-emptive or similar rights of any person.

 

 

6. To our Knowledge, as of their respective filing dates, none of the SEC Documents filed with the SEC contain any untrue statement of material fact or omitted a statement of material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. To our Knowledge the Parent's SEC Documents complied when filed in all material respects with the then applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder. To our Knowledge the Parent has filed all reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act.

 

 

7. Nothing has come to our attention that caused us to believe that Merger Agreement or the other Transactional Documents contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

the following:

and procedures, credit and financial data concerning the Company and/or the

highly competitive nature of the industry in which the Company\'s
Business is conducted, the Executive agrees that all
Proprietary Information, heretofore or in the future obtained by the
Executive as a result of the Executive\'s association with the Company
shall be considered confidential.

 In recognition of this fact, the Executive agrees that the
Executive, during the Restricted Period, will not use or disclose any of
such Proprietary Information for the Executive\'s own purposes or for
the benefit of any person or other entity or organization (except
the Company) under any circumstances unless such Proprietary Information has

counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Executive is legally
required to disclose such Proprietary Information. Documents (as hereinafter
defined) prepared by the Executive or that come into the
Executive\'s possession during the Executive\'s association with the Company
are and remain the property of the Company, and when this

    EXHIBIT H TO MERGER AGREEMENT

 

 

 

 h. Covenants as Essential Elements of this Agreement. It is understood
by and between the parties hereto that the foregoing covenants contained in
Sections 7a and b are essential elements of this Agreement, and that but for
the agreement by the Executive to comply with such covenants, the Company
would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement. Such covenants by the
Executive shall be construed to be agreements independent of any other
provisions of this Agreement. The existence of any other claim or cause
of action, whether predicated on any other provision in this Agreement, or
otherwise, as a result of the relationship between the parties shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against the
Executive. To the extent that the covenants contained in this Section 7 may
later be deemed by a court to be too broad to be enforced with respect
to their duration or with respect to any particular activity or geographic
area, the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration or scope of the provision, and to add or delete specific words or
phrases to or from the provision. The provision as modified shall then be
enforced.

 

 

 

 i. Survival After Termination of Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the covenants in Sections 7a
and b shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Executive\'s
employment with the Company.

 

 

 

 j. Remedies.

 

 

 

 (1) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company\'s remedy at
law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 7a
or b herein would be inadequate and the breach shall be per se deemed as
causing irreparable harm to the Company. In recognition of this fact, in the
event of a breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Section 7a or
b, the Executive agrees that, in addition to any remedy at law available to
the Company, including, but not limited to monetary damages, all rights of
the Executive to payment or otherwise under this Agreement and all amounts
then or thereafter due to the Executive from the Company under this Agreement
may be terminated and the Company, without posting any bond, shall be
entitled to obtain, and the Executive agrees not to oppose the Company\'s
request for equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary
restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable
remedy which may then be available to the Company.

 

 

 

 (2) The Executive acknowledges that the granting of a temporary
injunction, temporary restraining order or permanent injunction
merely prohibiting the use of Proprietary Information would not be
an adequate remedy upon breach or threatened breach of Section 7a or b and
consequently agrees, upon proof of any such breach, to the granting of
injunctive relief prohibiting any form of competition with the Company.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened
breach.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    EXHIBIT H TO MERGER AGREEMENT

applicable provisions.

Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to any
applicable law or regulation. In lieu of withholding such amounts, the

such tax and other payroll obligations will be satisfied in a manner
complying with applicable law or regulation.

the records of the Company, or in the case of the Company to its principal
office as set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement, or at
such other place as it may designate.

 

 

 

 11. Waiver. Unless agreed in writing, the failure of either party, at any
time, to require performance by the other of any provisions hereunder shall
not affect its right thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall a waiver by
either party of any breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a
waiver of any other preceding or succeeding breach of any term or provision
of this Agreement. No extension of time for the performance of any obligation
or act shall be deemed to be an extension of time for the performance of any
other obligation or act hereunder.

 

 

 

 12. Completeness and Modification. This Agreement constitutes the
entire understanding between the parties hereto superseding all prior
and contemporaneous agreements or understandings among the parties hereto
concerning the Agreement. This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded
or canceled, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by the
parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the party to be charged.

 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
shall constitute but one agreement.

 

 

 

 14.  Binding Effect/Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon

 19. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part,
