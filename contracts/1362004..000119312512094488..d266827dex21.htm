Firm reflecting the terms of this Agreement and any other customary provisions mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Initial Members). Purchaser and the Initial Members shall instruct the Accounting Firm not to, and the Accounting Firm shall

the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The resulting calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount and the corresponding Excess Amount or Shortfall Amount by the Accounting Firm
shall become final and binding on the parties hereto (and may be relied upon by SunTrust) on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to Purchaser and the Initial Members (which final resolution shall be requested by the

on the ratio of the disputed amount not awarded to such Person to the total amount actually disputed by the Initial Members and Purchaser. For example, if the aggregate amount disputed by the Initial Members is $1,000, and if Purchaser contests only
$500 of the amount disputed by the Initial Members, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by finding that the Initial Members properly disputed $300 of the $500, then the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be paid 60%
