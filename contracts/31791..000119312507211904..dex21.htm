v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 1,
2007, is among PerkinElmer, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Parent"),
Victor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Parent (the "Purchaser"), and ViaCell, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company").

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Purchaser and
the Company have determined that it would be advisable and in the
best interests of their respective stockholders for the Parent to acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Purchaser will make a cash
tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this
Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the Companys issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Company
Common Stock"), at a price of $7.25 per share, net to the seller in cash,
without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, to effectuate such acquisition, following consummation of the Offer,
the Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has by unanimous vote (i)
determined that the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interest
of, the Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") and (iii) declared the advisability of this Agreement
and resolved to recommend that the holders of the Company Common Stock tender
their shares into and accept the Offer and adopt this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE CASH TENDER OFFER _

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, within ten business
days of the day on which the Purchasers intention to make the Offer is
publicly announced (which announcement will be made by the Parent on October
1, 2007), the Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), the
Offer to purchase any and all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a
price of $7.25 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon
(the "Offer Consideration"). On the terms and subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of
the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, the Purchaser shall accept
for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the
expiration of the Offer and shall pay for all such shares of Company Common
Stock promptly after acceptance. The obligation of the Parent and the
Purchaser to commence the Offer and to accept for payment and pay for shares
of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ to
this Agreement.

(b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day
after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rules
14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). The Purchaser    expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with the Exchange Act,
to waive, amend or modify any term or condition of the Offer in its
sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, the Purchaser shall not:

(i) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the Offer
Consideration or decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought
pursuant to the Offer;

(ii) extend the expiration date of the Offer except (A) as required by
applicable law (including for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof), (B) that if, immediately prior
to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended), any
condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived, the Purchaser may, in
its sole discretion, and shall at the request of the Company, extend the
expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods (not in excess of ten
business days each) but in no event later than February 28, 2008 or (C) in
connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the
Offer so as to comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC;

(iii) waive the Minimum Condition;

(iv) amend any material term of the Offer in any manner materially adverse to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock or which would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the ability of the Parent and the Purchaser to consummate the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

(v) impose any condition to the Offer not set forth in _Annex I_.

The Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, elect to provide a
subsequent offering period for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act following its acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common
Stock in the Offer. If immediately following the Acceptance Time (as defined
in Section 1.3(a)), the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute more than 80%
but less than 90% of the Shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at that
time, then to the extent requested by the Company, the Purchaser shall provide
for a subsequent offering period of at least 5 business days; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to provide for such
subsequent offering period if it notifies the Company that it intends to
promptly exercise the Top-Up Option (as defined in Section 2.7(a)), and that
the Purchaser does so. The Offer may be terminated prior to its expiration
date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance
with this Agreement) only if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with its terms.

(c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser
shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect
to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain an offer to purchase (the "Offer
to Purchase"), a form of the related letter of transmittal (the "Letter of
Transmittal"), and ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the
Offer will be made (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Parent and the Purchaser agree that the
Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable U.S. federal securities laws and, on the date first filed with the
SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the
Companys stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty is made by the Parent or the
Purchaser with respect to information supplied by the Company or any of its
stockholders in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Offer Documents. The Parent and the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal securities laws. Each of the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company
each shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that  



 

2  such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule TO and, as applicable, the Offer Documents
and to cause the Schedule TO as so amended and supplemented to be filed with
the SEC and the Offer Documents as so amended and supplemented to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination to the stockholders of the
Company. The Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of any
oral comments the Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer promptly after the receipt thereof,
shall consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such
comments, and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any
written responses thereto and telephonic notification of any oral responses
thereto of the Parent or the Purchaser or their counsel.

(d) The Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Purchaser on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any and all shares of Company
Common Stock that the Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

(e) The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer such amounts as the
Purchaser reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or under any other applicable law.

1.2 _Company Actions_. 

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer, if practicable, and
otherwise reasonably promptly (and in any event within two business days)
thereafter, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") and disseminate the
Schedule 14D-9, to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities
laws, to the stockholders of the Company. Except and to the extent otherwise
permitted pursuant to Section 7.1 below, the Offer Documents and the Schedule
14D-9 shall contain the recommendation of the board of directors of the
Company (the "Company Board") in favor of the Offer and the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and
the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of such
recommendation. The Company agrees that the Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all
material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal
securities laws and on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date
first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by the Parent or
the Purchaser in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser each shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Parent and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9
and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or
dissemination to stockholders of the Company, except to the extent that any
delay caused by such opportunity to review and comment would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board. The Company shall provide
the Parent and its counsel with a copy of  



 

3  any written comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the Parent
and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and shall provide
the Parent and its counsel with a copy of any written responses thereto and
telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of the Company or its
counsel.

(c) The Company shall promptly supply to the Parent and the Purchaser in
writing, for inclusion in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, all
information concerning the Company required under applicable U.S. federal
securities laws to be included in the Offer Documents or that may be
reasonably requested by the Parent and the Purchaser in connection with the
preparation of the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents or their obligations
hereunder.

(d) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct and cause its
transfer agent to promptly furnish to the Purchaser or its designed agent
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of
the shares of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date and, to the extent known, a
list of the beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock as of a
recent date, together with copies of all security position listings and all
other computer files and other information in the Companys possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of such shares, and shall furnish to
the Purchaser such information and assistance (including updated lists and
information) as the Purchaser may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial owners of the shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the date of this Agreement, all such
information concerning the Companys record and, to the extent known,
beneficial holders shall be made available to the Purchaser. Subject to the
requirements of applicable laws and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser shall, until consummation
of the Offer, hold in confidence the information contained in any of such
labels and lists, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 9.1,
shall, upon request, deliver to the Company, or destroy at the Purchasers
election, all copies of such information then in their possession or under
their control.

1.3 _Directors_.

(a) Promptly after the first time at which the Purchaser accepts for payment
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Time")
satisfying the Minimum Condition, and from time to time thereafter as shares
of Company Common Stock are accepted for payment and paid for by the
Purchaser, the Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of
members of the Company Board (the "Purchaser Designees"), rounded up to the
nearest whole number, as will give the Purchaser representation on the Company
Board equal to the product of the total number of members of the Company
Board (after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Parent or the Purchaser at such time (including
shares of Company Common Stock so accepted for payment) bears to the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding; provided that in no
event shall the Purchaser Designees constitute less than a majority of
the Company Board. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon the
request of the Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts promptly (and in any
event within one business day) either to increase the size of the Company
Board or to secure the resignations of such number of the Companys incumbent
directors, or both, as is necessary to enable the Purchaser Designees to be so
elected or appointed to the Company Board and the Company shall take all
actions available to the Company to cause the Purchaser Designees to be so
elected or appointed. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by the
Purchaser, also take all action necessary to cause persons designated by the
Purchaser to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next
whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each subsidiary of
the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board.
The provisions of this Section 1.3  



 

4  are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which the Purchaser, the
Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner
of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable law with respect
to the election of directors or otherwise.

(b) The Company shall take all actions required in order to fulfill its
obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to its stockholders the
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder as part of the Schedule 14D-9, provided that the
Parent and the Purchaser have timely supplied to the Company in writing any
information with respect to the Parent and the Purchaser and the Purchaser
Designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, and
Parent shall be solely responsible for such information.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that at least two
of the members of the Company Board shall, at all times prior to the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 2.3 hereof), be directors of the Company who were
directors of the Company on the date hereof (the "Independent Directors"),
provided that, if there shall be in office less than two Independent Directors
for any reason, the Company Board shall cause the person designated by the
remaining Independent Director to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be
an Independent Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no
Independent Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in
office shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies who will not be
directors, officers, employees or affiliates of the Parent or the Purchaser
and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for all purposes
of this Agreement. From and after the time, if any, that the Purchaser
Designees constitute a majority of the Company Board and prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment or modification of
this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any
extension of time for performance of any of the obligations of the Parent or
the Purchaser hereunder, any waiver of any condition to the Companys
obligations hereunder or any of the Companys rights hereunder (other than a
waiver of clause (A) of Section 2.7(b)) or any amendment to the Companys
certificate of incorporation or bylaws may be effected only if (in addition to
the approval of the Company Board as a whole) there are in office one or more
Independent Directors and such action is approved by a majority of the
Independent Directors then in office.

ARTICLE II

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

conditions), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60
State Street, Boston, MA 02109, or at such other time, date or place agreed to
in writing by the Parent and the Company; provided that if all the conditions
set forth in Article VIII shall not have been satisfied or (to the

Agreement as the "Closing Date".

2.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, a certificate
of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the  



 

5  "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged
by the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent time or date
as the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Effective Time".

2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL.

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided under the DGCL.

2.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their successors are elected and qualified. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause each member of the Company Board,
other than the Purchaser Designees, to execute and deliver a letter
effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the Company effective
upon the Effective Time.

2.7 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to Section 2.7(b) and Section 2.7(c), the Company grants to
Purchaser an assignable and irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option") to
purchase from the Company the number of shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Purchaser as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (determined in
accordance with _Annex I_ ) (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the
aggregate of the number of shares of Company Common Stock held as treasury
shares by the Company and its Subsidiaries and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of
incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not reserved
for issuance pursuant to the instruments disclosed pursuant to Section 4.2(d))
as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Purchaser, in whole or in part, at
any time at or after the Acceptance Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of
the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by the Company,
that (A) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option
would not require approval of the Companys stockholders under applicable
laws, rules or regulations (including, without limitation, the NASDAQ rules
and regulations), (B) immediately following exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned in the aggregate
by the Parent, the Purchaser and each of the Parents direct and indirectly
wholly owned subsidiaries constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis (determined in accordance with _Annex I_ ) (assuming the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares) and (C) the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied.
The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable laws, rules or
regulations, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer
Consideration. Such purchase price may  



 

6  be paid by Purchaser, at its election, either in cash or by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
such purchase price, or by any combination of cash and such promissory note.
Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the applicable federal rate
determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code, shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and
may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

(c) In the event that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it
shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares that it intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii)
the manner in which it intends to pay the applicable exercise price and (iii)
the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares by Purchaser is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Option Shares, Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate
representing such shares.

(d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will
be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor",
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

ARTICLE III

_CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER_

3.1 _Effect of Merger of Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(i) each share of the Purchasers capital stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the same class of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the Parent, the Purchaser or the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company, including all shares of Company Common Stock held by
the Company as treasury stock, shall automatically be cancelled and
retired, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to clause (ii) above and any Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 3.1(b) hereof)) shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished
and be converted into and become the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation $7.25 in cash per share (or any such higher price per share as may
be paid in the Offer) without any interest thereon (the
"Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 3.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 3.2, without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding rights in accordance with Section 3.2(h).



 

7 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares
(the "Dissenting Shares") of the Companys Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a)(iii),
but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At
the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 3.1(a)(iii). The Company shall give the Parent and the Purchaser
prompt notice of any demands for payment, or notices of intent to demand
payment, received by the Company with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of the Parent and the Purchaser, make any payment with respect
to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

(c) Following the Effective Time, Company Stock Options and Company Warrants
shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 7.8 and Section 7.10.

3.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall select a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the payment after the Effective Time of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of Certificates. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the
Paying Agent, cash necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of Certificates (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund").

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate within five business days
after the Effective Time (or, if reasonably practicable, sooner): (i) a Letter
of Transmittal (in customary form and which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Parent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and properly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount of cash equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(iii), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of cash,  



 

8  without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(iii). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

(c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of the
capital stock of the Company (the "Company Capital Stock") formerly
represented by such Certificate. Upon the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III.

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by
the Paying Agent to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate
who has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to the Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, but shall have no
greater rights against the Parent than may be accorded to general unsecured
creditors of the Parent under applicable law. 

(e) None of the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from
the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 4.4)), any such cash in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund in (i)
direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for payment of all principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies,
or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing,
or a combination thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable hereunder and the Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Payment Fund to include at all times cash
necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of Certificates. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be the property of the
Parent.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration required pursuant to
Section 3.1(a)(iii), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof with such assurances as the Parent, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration, may require
of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

(h) The Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as any of them reasonably determines
that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other applicable law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent.



 

9 ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
the Parent on or before the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to
any other section of this Agreement, but only to the extent that it is readily
apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies
to such other section to which such disclosure is relevant), or as disclosed
in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2006, or any report filed with the SEC by the Company pursuant to the
Exchange Act after the date of filing of such Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
the SECs EDGAR system at least three business days prior to the date hereof
(other than any information in the "Risk Factors" and "Note Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements" sections of such Company SEC Documents, and other than
any other forward-looking statements contained in such Company SEC Documents
that are of a nature that they speculate about future developments) (the
"Designated SEC Documents"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
the Parent and the Purchaser as follows:

4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction listed in
Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which jurisdictions constitute
the only jurisdictions in which the character of the properties it owns,
operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good
standing that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event,
circumstance, development or effect that, individually or in the aggregate
with all other changes, events, circumstances, developments or effects
occurring or existing prior to the determination of a Company Material Adverse
Effect, has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets,
liabilities, capitalization, condition (financial or other), or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following shall be
deemed either alone or in combination with any of the following to constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) any adverse effect that results from
general economic, business, financial or market conditions (provided that
such adverse effect does not affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, in a disproportionate manner as compared to the Companys industry
peers); (B) any adverse effect that results from conditions in any of
the industries or industry sectors in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries operates (provided that such adverse effect does not affect the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner
as compared to the Companys industry peers); (C) any adverse effect
resulting from any act of terrorism, war, national or international calamity
or any other similar event (provided that such adverse effect does not affect
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate
manner as compared to the Companys industry peers); (D) any adverse effect
resulting from any change in any applicable United States or foreign, federal,
state or local laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations or agency
requirements of any Governmental Entity, or regulatory requirements (provided
that such adverse effect does not affect the Company in a disproportionate
manner as compared to the Companys industry peers or as compared to the
Parent); (E) any changes (after the date hereof) in GAAP; (F) any loss of
customers, suppliers, vendors or employees or any cancellation of or delay in
customer orders resulting from the announcement or pendency of
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger (but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
any direct legal or contractual consequence of the Companys execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby); (G) the failure of the Company
to meet internal or analysts expectations or projections, in and of itself
(it being understood that any cause of any such failure may be deemed to
constitute, in and of itself, a Company Material Adverse Effect and may be
taken into consideration when determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred); (H) any adverse effect resulting from any action taken
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with Parents prior written consent
or the taking of any action  



 

10  expressly required by this Agreement (other than in the first sentence of
Section 6.1); (I) a decline in the Companys stock price, in and of itself
(it being understood that any cause of any such decline may be deemed to
constitute, in and of itself, a Company Material Adverse Effect and may be
taken into consideration when determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred); and (J) the Companys continuing to suffer operating
losses in amounts not materially larger than the losses projected to be
suffered by the Company in projections previously provided to Parent by the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the terms
"material", "materially" or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an
initial lower case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary
meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse
Effect in the prior sentence of this paragraph. The Company has delivered to
the Parent complete and accurate copies of the Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws of the Company. 

4.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par
value per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). The rights and privileges of
each class of the Companys capital stock are as set forth in the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation. As of September 27, 2007, (i) 39,079,100 shares
of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of
Company Common Stock were held in the treasury of the Company or by
Subsidiaries of the Company, and (iii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock
were designated, issued or outstanding.

(b) The Company has made available to the Parent complete and accurate list of
all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that constitute
restricted stock or that are otherwise subject to a repurchase or redemption
right or right of first refusal in favor of the Company, indicating the name
of the applicable stockholder, the vesting schedule for any such
shares, including the extent to which any such repurchase or redemption right
or right of first refusal has lapsed as of the date of this Agreement, whether
(and to what extent) the vesting will be accelerated in any way by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by termination of employment
or change in position following consummation of the Merger, and whether such
holder has the sole power to vote and dispose of such shares.

(c) The Company has made available to the Parent complete and accurate
information, as of the date of this Agreement, regarding all plans or other
arrangements under which Company Stock Options (as defined below) were granted
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), indicating for each Company Stock
Plan, as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date
of this Agreement, the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued to
date under such Plan, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
outstanding options under such Plan (such outstanding options, the "Company
Stock Options") and the number of shares of Company Common Stock reserved for
future issuance under such Plan. The Company has made available to the Parent

and accurate list of all contracts and agreements (collectively, the "Company
Material Contracts"), that are material to the business, assets, liabilities,
capitalization, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company
has provided the Parent with a complete and accurate copy of each Company
Material Contract. Each Company Material Contract is in full force and effect
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, any other party to
any Company Material Contract is in violation of or in default under (nor does
there exist any condition which, upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both, would cause such a violation of or default under) any Company
Material Contract, except for violations or defaults that have not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
transaction with any Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any transaction that would be subject to proxy statement disclosure pursuant
to Item 404 of Regulation S-K that has not been disclosed in a Designated SEC
Document.

(c) There is no non-competition or other similar agreement, commitment,
judgment, injunction or order to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or is subject that has or would reasonably be expected to result in
the effect of prohibiting or impairing the conduct of the business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Company does
not as of the date of this Agreement have any "standstill" agreements in
effect that restrict the acquisition of securities of the Company, or the
taking of certain other actions relating to the control of the Company, by
third parties other than the Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into (or is otherwise bound by) any agreement under
which it is now, or following the Effective Time the Parent or any of the
Parents Affiliates (including without limitation the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) would be, restricted from selling, licensing or otherwise
distributing any of their respective technology or products, or providing
services to, customers or potential customers or any class of customers, in
any geographic area, during any period of time or any segment of the market or
line of business.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement under which a third party would be entitled to receive a license or
any other right to intellectual property of the Parent or any of the Parents
Affiliates following the Closing that such party did not have before Closing.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been suspended
or debarred from bidding on contracts or subcontracts with any Governmental
Entity; no such suspension or debarment has been initiated or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened; and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any such suspension or
debarment. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has since January
1, 2001 been audited or investigated or is now being audited or, to the
Companys knowledge, investigated by the U.S. Government Accounting Office,
the U.S. Department of Justice, or the Inspector General of any Governmental
Entity, nor, to the Companys knowledge, has any such audit or investigation
been threatened. To the Companys knowledge, there is no valid basis for (a)
the suspension or debarment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
bidding on contracts or subcontracts with any Governmental Entity or (b) any
material claim pursuant to an audit or investigation by any of the entities
named in the foregoing sentence.

is no material action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no material judgments,
orders or decrees outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
No claims have been asserted or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to services, products
or product candidates developed, tested, manufactured, marketed, distributed
or sold by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case that if decided adversely to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would
be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

21 4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) The Company has made available to the Parent a complete and accurate list
of all Employee Benefit Plans maintained, or contributed to, by the Company,

"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any

the Code), any of which includes or, at any applicable time included, the
Company or a Subsidiary.

(b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company has made available
to the Parent, a complete and accurate copy of (i) such Company Employee Plan
(or a written summary of any unwritten plan), (ii) the most recent annual
report (Form 5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), if

policies, (vi) all current employee handbooks and (vii) the three most recent
reports regarding the satisfaction of the nondiscrimination requirements of
Sections 410(b), 401(k) and 401(m) of the Code. 

(c) Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws and the
regulations thereunder and in accordance with its terms and each of the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all
material respects met its obligations with respect to such Company Employee
Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved such
contributions on the Company Balance Sheet). All filings and reports as to
each Company Employee Plan required to have been submitted to the Internal
Revenue Service or to the United States Department of Labor have been timely
submitted, except where the failure to do so has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect. With
respect to the Company Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to be subject
to any material liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.

(d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP (to the
extent required by GAAP), on the financial statements of the Company, except
for any such failures to make, accrue, account for or footnote that have not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Code, no such determination or opinion letter has been revoked and revocation
has not been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or
operated since the date of its most recent determination or opinion letter or
application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred,
that would adversely affect its qualification or  



 

22  materially increase its cost. Each Company Employee Plan which is required
to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested
for compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending
prior to the Closing Date.

(f) Neither the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Company Employee Plan which was
ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been
obligated to contribute to a "Multiemployer Plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with
or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan holds
securities issued by the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates.

(g) Except as disclosed in Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there have been no oral amendments or modifications to any Company
Employee Plan made by (or with the consent of) the Company that would impair
the Companys right to amend or terminate each Company Employee Plan
in accordance with the terms of such Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any
stockholders, director, executive officer or other employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the
terms of which are altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing any term of employment or
compensation guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits
after the termination of employment of such director, executive officer or
employee; or (ii) agreement or plan binding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan,
restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan or severance benefit plan, any of
the benefits of which shall be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of
which shall be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which
shall be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company has provided to the Parent the information
necessary to accurately calculate any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the
Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which
the Company or the Parent may directly or indirectly become liable and the
amount of deductions that may be disallowed under Section 280G of the Code as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by
applicable law.

(i) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)) has been operated since January
1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Code Section 409A and IRS Notice 2005-1.
No Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
has been materially modified (as determined under Notice 2005-1) after October
3, 2004. No event has occurred that would be treated by Code Section 409A(b)
as a transfer of property for purposes of Code Section 83\. No stock option
or equity unit option granted under any Company Employee Plan had an exercise
price that was or may have been less than the fair market value of the
underlying stock or equity units (as the case may be) as of the date such
option was granted, or has any feature for the deferral of compensation other
than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or
disposition of such option.

4.15 _Compliance With Laws_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has complied with, and is not in
violation of, any applicable provisions of any statute, law or regulation with
respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its
properties or assets, except for any such failure to be in compliance that
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has

violation with respect to any applicable provisions of any statute, law or
regulation with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or

any other comparable Governmental Entity required to conduct their respective
businesses. Each of the Registrations is valid and subsisting in full force
and effect, and may be assigned and transferred to Parent in accordance with
the Agreement. The Company does not have knowledge that FDA or any other
comparable Governmental Entity is or may consider limiting, suspending, or
revoking such Registrations, changing the marketing classification or
materially changing labeling of the Companys products. To the Companys
knowledge, there is no false or misleading information or significant omission
in any product application or other submission to FDA or any other comparable
Governmental Entity. The Company has fulfilled and performed its
obligations under each Registration in all material respects, and no material
event has occurred or condition or state of facts exists which would
constitute a breach or default or would cause revocation or termination of any
such Registration. To the Companys knowledge, any third party that is a
supplier, manufacturer, or contractor for the Company is in compliance in all
material respects with all Registrations from the FDA or any comparable
Governmental Entity insofar as they pertain to the manufacture of product
components or products for the Company. For purposes of this Agreement,

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

7.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.1, the Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors and
representatives, collectively, "Representatives") to directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, including without
limitation (A) approving any transaction under Section 203 of the DGCL and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the acceptance for payment of any
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Specified Time"),
the Company may, to the extent failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board, as determined in good faith by the
Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date
of this Agreement that the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel and a nationally recognized
independent financial advisor is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, in each case that did not result from a breach by the Company of
this Section 7.1, and subject to compliance with Section 7.1(c), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations (including
solicitation of a revised Acquisition Proposal) with such person and its
Representatives regarding any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 7.1(a) by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.1(a)
by the Company.



 

33 (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(i) except as set forth in this Section 7.1 withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or the Purchaser, the
approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger;

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,

circumstances referred to in 7.1(a));

any Acquisition Proposal.

(other than an immaterial breach) its obligations under Section 7.1(a), the
Company Board may withdraw or modify the recommendation by the Company Board
or any committee thereof of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger in
circumstances where the Company Board has determined that a Superior Proposal
is outstanding, if (1) (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that to do otherwise would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board, but only at a time that
is prior to the Specified Time and is after the third business day following
the Parents receipt of written notice (an "Adverse Recommendation Notice")
advising the Parent that the Company Board desires to withdraw or modify the
recommendation (and the manner and timing in which it intends to do so), and
(B) the Company provides the Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiates in
good faith with the Parent with respect thereto during the three (3) business
day period after the Parent has received the Adverse Recommendation Notice, in
each case as would enable the Company Board or committee thereof to proceed
with its recommendation in favor of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger,
and (2) (A) such withdrawal is due to the existence of a Superior Proposal,
and the Company has complied with the requirements of Section 7.1(c),
including without limitation specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior
Proposal, and (B) the Parent shall not have within three (3) business days of
the receipt of the Adverse Recommendation Notice made an offer or
proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial and legal advisors) to be at least as favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view as such Superior
Proposal. Nothing in this Section 7.1 shall be deemed to permit the Company
to take any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of
this Section 7.1(b) unless it has terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(d)(iii) and paid to the Parent the fees specified in Section 9.3.
In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Specified Time, the Company Board may in response to a material development or
change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was
neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior
to the date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such
material development or change in circumstances, an "Intervening Event"),
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in Section 9.1(c)(ii)
hereof) if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, failure
to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations; _provided_ that, the Company Board shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (x) provided to the
Parent at least three business days prior written notice (unless the
Intervening Event arises fewer than three business days prior to the
Specified Time) advising the Parent that the Company Board intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (y)
during such three business day period, if requested by the Parent, engaged in
good faith negotiations with the Parent to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that obviates the need or reason for a Company Adverse  



 

34  Recommendation Change as a result of the Intervening Event. Any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement
or any other approval of the Company Board, including in any respect that
would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate
takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

(c) The Company shall promptly advise the Parent orally, with
written confirmation to follow within 24 hours, of any Acquisition Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected
to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep the Parent
informed, on a current basis, of the status and material details (including
any material change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,
(ii) provide to the Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company, including those provided by electronic mail, from any
third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by
the Company to any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
and (iii) if the Parent shall make a counterproposal, consider in good faith
the terms of such counterproposal. Contemporaneously with providing any
information to a third party in connection with any such Superior Proposal or
inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of such information to the Parent.

(d) Nothing contained in Section 7.1 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a
tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall the
Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 7.1(b).

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have all copies of all nonpublic information it or its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives have distributed on or prior to the date of
this Agreement to other potential purchasers returned to the Company as soon
as possible.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

"Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets, tender offer,
recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of over 15% of its equity securities or
(iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly,
over 15% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company,
in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

"Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written proposal made by
a third party to acquire a majority of the equity securities or assets of the
Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, other business combination or a sale of its assets, (i) on
terms which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to be
more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after consultation
with a nationally recognized independent financial advisor), taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any proposal by the Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement)
and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal.



 

35 7.2 _Efforts; Consents, Notices and Approvals_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to cooperate with each
of the other parties hereto in connection with the foregoing, including using
its reasonable best efforts: (A) to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and
approvals from third parties; (B) to obtain all necessary consents, approvals
and authorizations as are required to be obtained under any federal, state or
foreign laws or regulations; (C) to effect all necessary registrations and
filings, including filings under the HSR Act and submissions of information
requested by Governmental Entities; (D) to fulfill all conditions to this
Agreement; and (E) to keep each other reasonably informed of progress with
respect to tenders of shares of Company Common Stock. Each of the Company,
the Parent and the Purchaser further covenants and agrees that, prior to the
exercise by the Parent or the Purchaser of its right to terminate the Offer
under paragraphs (iii)(a) or (iii)(b) of  _Annex I_, each of the Company,
the Parent and the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Section shall
require either the Company, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to: (i) agree
to or to effect any divestiture of, or hold separate (including by
establishing a trust or otherwise), or agree to restrict its ownership or
operation of, any business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or Purchaser and its subsidiaries, or to enter into
any settlement or consent decree, or agree to any undertaking, with respect to
any business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or
its Subsidiaries or of Purchaser and its subsidiaries, (ii) enter into, amend
or agree to enter into or amend, any contracts or agreements of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries, (iii) otherwise waive, abandon or alter any material rights or
obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or (iv) file or defend any
lawsuit, appeal any judgment or contest any injunction issued in a proceeding
initiated by a Governmental Entity if such action is reasonably expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be prohibited under this Section 7.2(a) from taking any
action permitted by the terms of Section 7.1.

(b) The Company shall confer with the Parent on a regular and frequent basis
as reasonably requested by the Parent concerning operational matters and
promptly advise the Parent orally and in writing of any change or event
having, or which would reasonably be expected to result in, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall promptly provide to the Parent (or
its counsel) copies of all filings made by the Company with any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.2(a), if any "fair price" or
"control share acquisition" or "anti-takeover" statute, or other similar
statute or regulation or any state "blue sky" statute shall become applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the
Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
thereby, and otherwise act to minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

7.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_. 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to the
Parent if, at any time (i) any change, event, circumstance, development or
effect occurs or exists that would result in any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
not being true and accurate in any respect as if such representation or
warranty were made at such time, or any such representation or warranty that
is not so qualified not being true and accurate in any material respect as if
such representation or warranty were made at such time, or (ii) the Company
fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it  



 

36  under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall, within 24 hours after it has notice of any of
the following, notify the Parent of: 

(i) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any Subsidiary which, if pending on the
date of this Agreement would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby.

(b) The Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company if, at any time (i) any
change, event, circumstance, development or effect occurs or exists that would
result in any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality not being true
and accurate in any respect as if such representation or warranty were made at
such time, or any such representation or warranty that is not so
qualified not being true and accurate in any material respect as if such
representation or warranty were made at such time, or (ii) the Parent or the
Purchaser fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by them
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parent or the Purchaser or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

7.4 _Company Stockholder Approval of the Merger_. 

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is
required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall,
acting through the Company Board, at the Parents request, as soon as
practicable following the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares
of Company Common Stock by the Purchaser in the Offer (coordinating the
timing thereof with the Parent), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the
purpose of obtaining such stockholder approval. Subject to Section 7.1, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall, through the Company
Board, recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 7.4(a) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchaser or any other subsidiary of the
Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock, the parties shall, at the request of the Parent, take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders
meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is
required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall,
at the Parents request, as soon as practicable following the acceptance for
payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock by the Purchaser
in the Offer, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy or information statement
(the "Proxy Statement") in accordance with the Exchange Act and any other
applicable laws, and will use its reasonable efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to
all such comments to the satisfaction of the staff. The Company shall notify
the Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments  



 

37  from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any
request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information, and shall supply the Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of its representatives, on the on hand, and the
SEC, or its staff, or any other government officials on the other hand with
respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall consult with the Parent and
its counsel prior to responding to any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its stockholders and file with the SEC any such amendment
or supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, to the Companys stockholders unless it has
first obtained the consent of the Parent to such mailing, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) The Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased by the
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock
owned by the Parent or the Purchaser or any other subsidiary of the Parent to
be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

7.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Companys and such Subsidiaries
Representatives to, afford to the Parent and its Representatives complete
access, at all reasonable times, during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries,
properties, books, records, contracts, commitments and personnel and shall
furnish the Parent all financial, operating and other data and information as
the Parent may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law, the
Parent will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company shall, within two business days of any request
therefore, provide to the Parent the information described in Rule
14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information to which a holder
of Company Common Stock would be entitled under Section 220 of the DGCL
(assuming such holder met the requirements of such section). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure for the Parent access to and
copies of the workpapers of its independent public accountants. No information
or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section or
otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained in the Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Offer or the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose any
information if doing so would (i) violate any applicable laws, rules or
regulations, (ii) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect
to such information (provided that such privilege cannot be reasonably
sufficiently protected using a joint defense or other similar agreement) or
(iii) result in a breach of an agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or result in the disclosure of trade secrets of third
parties. The Parent and the Company shall work together in scheduling and
coordinating all inspections.

7.6 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations, (i) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Parent and (ii) the Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon,
any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and
the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to using such efforts, except to the extent that any delay
caused by such consultation, opportunity to review and comment would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the board of directors of
Parent or the Company, as applicable.

7.7 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Purchaser shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the
Companys obligations to indemnify and advance expenses, to hold harmless and
to exculpate each  



 

38  present and former director and officer of the Company (the "Indemnified
Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid
in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the extent that such obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless, advance expenses or exculpate exist on the date of this Agreement.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent and the
Purchaser shall either cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the
extent available in the market) in effect a directors and officers liability
insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and
accurate copy of which has been made available to the Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement), or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a
"tail policy", in either case with coverage in amount and scope at least
favorable to such persons as the Companys existing coverage; provided that in
no event shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
in excess of 225% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such coverage. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase prior to the
Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
providing not materially more favorable benefits as the current directors
and officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy, in which case the Parent and the Purchaser shall not be
required to purchase a "tail policy" pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, provided that the Company shall not expend, in purchasing such "tail
policy", an amount in excess of $1,250,000.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. 

(d) In the event the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, if the
Parent and the Surviving Corporations successors and assigns do not assume
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8 by operation of law, then
proper provision shall be made such that such successors and assigns assume
such obligations. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be
deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
section is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any
such policies.

7.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to the extent such employees remain
employed by the Surviving Corporation ("Company Employees") (i) a base salary
at a rate no less than the rate of annual base salary provided to such
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits
(excluding equity compensation) that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall, subject to
applicable law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and  



 

39  its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Employee
Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in
a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to the Company Employee Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii)(A) for purposes of
each New Plan providing primarily medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, the Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under Old Plan of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (B) the Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps necessary
to cause all Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to become fully vested and
each such Company Stock Option to be cancelled, as of the Effective Time,
in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section
3.2(h) with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (x) the excess
of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of
such Company Stock Option by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option (the "Option Consideration"). Payment of
Option Consideration shall be made as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time.

(d) On the Closing Date (or, to the extent the date of the Closing can be
reasonably anticipated by the Company, on the second business day prior to the
Closing Date), the Company shall provide to the Parent a complete and accurate
list of all outstanding Company Stock Options as of the Closing Date,
indicating with respect to each such Company Stock Option the name of the
holder thereof, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option as of the Closing Date, the exercise price and the date
of grant. 

7.9 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 401(k) Plan_. As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board or, if appropriate,
any committee administering the ViaCell, Inc., Inc. 2004 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as are required to (i) cancel all options granted under such plan and
(ii) terminate such plan prior to the Effective Time and return all payroll
deduction amounts credited to the participants in such plan entitled thereto.
Prior to the Effective time, the Company Board or, if appropriate,
any committee administering the Companys 401(k) Plan, shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as are required to terminate such plan
on or prior to the Effective Time.

7.10 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. The Company shall take all commercially
reasonable actions necessary to ensure that all Company Warrants, to the
extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall terminate and be
cancelled as of the Effective Time and thereafter shall be of no further force
or effect.

7.11 _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall give the Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and its directors relating to any Transaction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without
the Parents consent.



 

40 7.12 _Parent Guaranty_. The Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees the
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement and agrees to be liable for any
breach of this Agreement by the Purchaser.

ARTICLE VIII

Merger.

(iii) if the Company materially breaches the covenant contained in Section 7.1
of this Agreement.

(d) by the Company, prior to the purchase of any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer: 

(i) if the Parent or the Purchaser breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of their respective representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
materially impairs the Parents and the Purchasers ability to consummate the
Offer or the Merger and which breach or failure to perform cannot be or has
not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the Parent
of such breach (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement);

(ii) upon three business days notice to the Parent if, for any reason, (x)
the Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer by the date that is 15
business days after the date of this Agreement (other than as a result of the
failure by the Company to provide any information to the Parent that is
required to be provided hereunder) or (y) the Offer expires as a result of
the non-satisfaction of the Minimum Condition without the Purchaser having
accepted for payment all shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer, in each of (x) and (y) which failure has not be cured prior to the
expiration of such three business days notice; _provided_ that the Company is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement; and _provided further_ , that the Parent shall
retain any right it has to terminate this Agreement prior to the expiration of
such three business days notice; or

(iii) if: (A) the Company has not breached (other than any immaterial breach)
Section 7.1; (B) the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal; (C) in
light of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure of the
Company Board to withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations; (D) the Company has notified the Parent in writing (which shall
include written electronic communication) of the determinations described in
clause (C) above on the date such determinations are made; (E) at least three
business days following delivery to the Parent of the notice referred to in
clause (D) above (or, if such notice is delivered fewer than three business
days prior to the Specified Time, then for the period remaining up to
immediately prior to the Specified Time), and taking into account any revised
proposal that is binding and irrevocable for such three business day (or, as
applicable, shorter) period made by the Parent, such Superior Proposal remains
a Superior Proposal and the Company Board has again made the determinations
referred to in clause (C) above; (F) at or before the effective time of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d)(iii), the
Company pays to the Parent the fee due under Section 9.3; and (G) the Company
Board concurrently approves, and the Company concurrently enters into, a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior
Proposal.



 

42 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 9.1, all obligations and agreements of the parties set
forth in this Agreement shall forthwith terminate and be of no further force
or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of the Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company hereunder, except as set forth in 4.22, 5.9, this
Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X, which provisions shall survive such
termination; provided that the foregoing shall not relieve any party for
liability for damages actually incurred as a result of any willful breach of
this Agreement.

9.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.3, each party shall bear
all of the fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, and no party may recover any

Agreement.

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iii);

(ii) the Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) or
Section 9.1(c)(iii), in either case as a result of the Companys willful
breach of Section 7.1;

(iv) after the date of this Agreement: (A) any person makes an Acquisition
Proposal or amends an Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date of this

Any fee due under this Section 9.3(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-
day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement (except that in the
case of clause (iv) above, in which case such payment shall be made on the
date of execution of such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation
of such transactions).

9.4 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may
amend, modify and supplement this Agreement in any and all respects, whether
before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such stockholder
approvals shall have been obtained, no amendment shall be made which, under
applicable law, requires the further approval of such stockholders without
such approval. Any such amendment, modification or supplement shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly

the other parties contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

9.6 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, an amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4 or an
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.5 shall, in order
to be effective, require, in the case of the Purchaser or the Company, action
by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of
Directors (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the approval
contemplated by Section 1.3(c)).

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, facsimile, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless
and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any
party to this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the  



 

44  manner herein set forth. For the avoidance of doubt, a notice or other
communication required under this Agreement to be delivered or received on or
before a certain date or at or before a certain time, and actually delivered
or received (without regard to this Section 10.2) on or before such date or at
or before such time, shall not be considered not timely delivered or received
because such notice is deemed delivered or received at a later time pursuant
to this Section 10.2.

10.3 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

10.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than the provisions of Section 7.7,
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any other person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto.

10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Parent and/or the Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent without the consent of the
Company, provided that the Parent and/or the Purchaser, as the case may be,
shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

10.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

10.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

10.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Party. Whenever the
context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, including _Annex I_ , they  



 

45  shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The term
"affiliate" of any person means any person that directly or indirectly,
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with, such first person and the term "person" means any
individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, trust,
limited liability company, unincorporated organization or other entity. For
purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall not be deemed to be an affiliate
or Subsidiary of the Purchaser or the Parent. Inclusion of information in the
Company Disclosure Schedule does not constitute an admission or
acknowledgment of the materiality of such information. No summary of this
Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The term "knowledge" with respect to the Company shall mean
the actual knowledge, after reasonable investigation, of the individuals
listed on Section 10.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Representations and
warranties as to the enforceability of contracts, including this Agreement,
shall be deemed qualified as to enforceability by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors rights
generally and general principles of equity and subject to the
due authorization, execution, and delivery by the counter-parties thereto.
Where this Agreement refers to information that has been "made available" to
the Parent, that shall mean that such information was either (i) included in
the Designated SEC Documents or (ii) included in the Bowne electronic data
room at least two business days prior to the date of this Agreement.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

10.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents
to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense or inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing
in this Section 10.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

10.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARENT, THE PURCHASER AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARENT, THE PURCHASER OR THE COMPANY
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

47 _ANNEX I_

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

_Capitalized terms used in this Annex I but not defined herein have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, the
Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including Rule 14e-1(c)
under the Exchange Act, to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may terminate or amend the Offer, and may
postpone the acceptance of, or payment for, any shares of Company Common
Stock, if:

(i) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), the number of shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn does not equal at least a
majority of such shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted
basis on the date of purchase (where "on a fully diluted basis" means the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, together with the
shares of Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue
pursuant to warrants, options or other obligations outstanding at that date
under employee stock or similar benefit plans or otherwise, whether or not
vested or then exercisable) (the "Minimum Condition");

(ii) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), any applicable waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall not have expired or
been terminated; or

(iii) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and before the
Specified Time, any of the following shall occur and shall continue to
exist: 

(a) there shall be instituted or pending any suit, action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity (1) challenging, making illegal or otherwise restraining
or prohibiting, or seeking to challenge, make illegal or otherwise restrain or
prohibit, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer
and the Merger, or seeking to obtain from the Company or (to the extent it
relates to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer
or the Merger) the Parent or any of its Affiliates, any material damages, (2)
seeking to prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by the
Company, the Parent or the Purchaser of all or any material portion of the
business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (to the extent it
materially affects the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including
the Offer or the Merger) of the Parent and its Affiliates, (3) seeking to
compel the Company, the Parent or the Purchaser to dispose of or to hold
separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or (to the extent it materially affects the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer or the Merger)
of the Parent or any of its Affiliates, (4) seeking to impose any material
limitation on the ability of the Company, the Parent or the Purchaser to
conduct the business or own the assets or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (to the extent it materially affects the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer or the Merger) of the
Parent or any of its Affiliates, (5) seeking to impose material limitations on
the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser to acquire or hold, or to exercise
full rights of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock, including the
right to vote such Shares on all matters properly presented to the Companys
stockholders, or (6) seeking to require divestiture by the Parent or the
Purchaser of all or any of the shares of Company Common Stock;

(b) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, interpretation,
judgment, order or injunction enacted, promulgated, entered, enforced,
amended or issued, by any Governmental Entity, which is applicable to (x) the
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or (y)
the Offer, the Merger or the Agreement, other than the routine application to
the Offer and the Merger of the waiting period provisions under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Act, that has the effect of making illegal, or  



 

A - 1  prohibiting or otherwise directly or indirectly restraining or prohibiting
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the Offer and
the Merger, or that results in, or would reasonably be expected to result in,
directly or indirectly, any of the consequences referred to in paragraph (a)
above;

(c) there shall have occurred, since the date of this Agreement, any event,
change, occurrence, effect, fact or circumstance which has had, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(d) (1) Any representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section
4.2 (to the extent relating to the number of outstanding shares of capital
stock and the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to, and the
exercise price of, Company Stock Options, and except for any minor
inaccuracy), Section 4.4(a) or clause (i) of Section 4.7 of the Agreement
shall not be true and correct, in each case as of the date of the Agreement
and as of the date of determination as though made on the date of
determination (except to the extent such representation or warranty expressly
relates to a specified date, in which case as of such date) or (2) any other
representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Agreement shall not
be true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications or
limitations as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect set forth
therein) as of the date of the Agreement and as of the date of determination
as though made on the date of determination (except to the extent that such
representation or warranty expressly relates to a specified date, in which
case as of such specified date), except, in the case of this clause (2), where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true as of such
dates, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(e) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or
covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the
Agreement;

(f) there shall have occurred any Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

(g) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

which in the reasonable judgment of the Parent and the Purchaser, in any such
case and regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition,
makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment
or payment for Shares.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of the Parent and the
Purchaser and may be waived by the Parent or the Purchaser (except for the
Minimum Condition), in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in
their respective sole discretion. The failure by the Parent or the Purchaser
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a
waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to any
particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect
to any other facts and circumstances and each such right will be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. Any
determination by the Parent or the Purchaser concerning the events described
in this  _Annex I_ shall be final and binding upon all parties.



 

A - 2 Exhibits omitted pursuant to Item 601(b)(2) of Regulation S-K. The Registrant
agrees to furnish a supplemental copy of any omitted exhibit to the SEC upon
request.
