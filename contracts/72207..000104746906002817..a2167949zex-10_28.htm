 _AGREEMENT_ :

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, Seller, the Company, the Subsidiary, and Buyer do hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 
_TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION_

  

    
 Section 1.1. _ _ _Agreement to Purchase and Sell Shares._ Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase, for the consideration hereinafter set forth and subject to the terms and provisions herein, the Shares. 

  

    
 Section 1.2. _ _ _Purchase Price._ In consideration of the sale of the Shares to Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Seller an aggregate cash purchase price of $411,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.3_ is herein called the "Adjusted Purchase Price". 

  

    
 Section 1.3. _ _ _Potential Adjustments to the Purchase Price._ 

  

 (a) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amounts listed below in this _Section 1.3(a)_: 

  

  

 (i) the amount, if any, by which Actual Adjusted Working Capital on September 30, 2005 exceeds a balance of $27,374; and 

  

 (ii) the amount, if any, of any increases to the Purchase Price as provided in _Section 9.1(f)_. 

  

  

 (b) The Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amounts listed below in this _Section 1.3(b)_: 

  

  

 (i) the amount, if any, by which Actual Adjusted Working Capital on September 30, 2005 is less than a balance of $27,374; 

  

 (ii) the amount, if any, of the decrease for Title Defects, Environmental Defects and Damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties as provided in _Section 9.4_; 

  

 (iii) the amount of transaction costs incurred by the Company or the Subsidiary between September 30, 2005 and the Closing Date (including but not limited to any amounts owed Petrie Parkman and Co., Thompson and Knight LLP, and any other advisors to the Company, Subsidiary, or Seller), if such transaction costs were incurred solely because of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;     

  
  

 (iv) the amount of costs paid by the Company or the Subsidiary between September 30, 2005 and the Closing Date to settle or terminate any Hedges other than such costs paid by the Company or the Subsidiary out of proceeds of the Bridge Facility; 

   

 (v) the amount of severance payments and change of control payments to officers, directors, and employees of the Company and the Subsidiary that are to be paid to such persons after the Closing; and 

  

 (vi) the amount, if any, of the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Bridge Facility. 

  

  

 (c) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and submit to Buyer a statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, the Company\'s computation of the adjustments to the Purchase Price described in _Section 1.3(a)_ and _paragraphs (i)_ and _(ii)_ of _Section 1.3(b)_, as applicable, and such calculation shall be utilized by the parties for purposes of payment of the Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to _Section 1.4_. 

  

 (d) After the Closing, Buyer shall review the calculation of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital on September 30, 2005 made at Closing and submit an updated calculation to Seller within 90 days after the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer shall thereafter meet at a mutually agreeable time (but no later than 120 days after the Closing Date) to review the calculation of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital on September 30, 2005, made at Closing, Buyer\'s updated calculation thereof, and determine in good faith whether any additional revisions to such amount are necessary. If, based on such review, Seller and Buyer determine that the Actual Adjusted Working Capital figure utilized for purposes of _Sections 1.3(a)(i)_ and _(b)(i)_ (the "Closing Date Adjusted Working Capital Amount") was inaccurate (the amount, as so redetermined under this _Section 1.3(d)_, being called the "Post-Closing Adjusted Working Capital Amount"), then, within three Business Days after such determination (i) Seller and Buyer shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to (A) disburse to Buyer out of the Working Capital Escrow an amount equal to the excess of that portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price attributable to the Post-Closing Adjusted Working Capital Amount being less than the Closing Date Adjusted Working Capital Amount, and (B) disburse to Seller the remainder of the Working Capital Escrow or (ii) (A) Buyer shall tender to Seller in cash any additional amount owed to Seller as a part of the Adjusted Purchase Price to the extent that the Post-Closing Adjusted Working Capital Amount is greater than the Closing Date Adjusted Working Capital Amount and (B) Seller and Buyer shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller the Working Capital Escrow. In no event shall the Post-Closing Adjusted Working Capital Amount include expenditures made to settle or terminate any Hedge. 

   

 (e) If a dispute arises under _Section 1.3(d)_ with respect to the calculation of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital on September 30, 2005 (an "Accounting Dispute") that the parties have been unable to resolve, then, at the written request of either Seller or Buyer (the "Request Date"), each of Seller and Buyer shall nominate and commit one of its senior officers to meet at a mutually agreed time and place not later than 10 days after the Request Date to attempt to resolve same. If such senior officers have been unable to resolve such Accounting Dispute within a period of 30 days after the Request Date, any party shall have the right, by written notice to the other specifying in reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Dispute, to resolve the Accounting Dispute by submission thereof to a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm commonly considered as one of the "Big 4" and reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer, which firm shall serve as sole arbitrator (the "Accounting Referee"). The scope of the Accounting Referee\'s engagement shall be limited to the resolution of the items described in the notice of the Accounting Dispute given in accordance with the foregoing and the corresponding calculation of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital. The Accounting Referee shall be instructed by the parties to resolve the Accounting Dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in light of the circumstances but in no event in excess of 15 days following the submission 

        
  

of the Accounting Dispute to the Accounting Referee. The decision and award
of the Accounting Referee shall be binding upon the parties as an award under
the Federal Arbitration Act and final and nonappealable to the maximum extent
permitted by law, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent
jurisdiction and enforced by any party as a final judgment of such court. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Seller
and Buyer.

  

    
 Section 1.4. _ _ _Payment of the Adjusted Purchase Price._ At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to (i) Seller cash equal to the Adjusted Purchase Price less the Working Capital Escrow and less the Warranties Escrow and less the Gathering Escrow and less the Defects Escrow, if any, (ii) the Escrow Agent cash equal to the Working Capital Escrow plus the Warranties Escrow plus the Gathering Escrow to hold pursuant to this Agreement and the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement, and (iii) the Escrow Agent cash equal to the Defects Escrow to hold pursuant to the Defects Escrow Agreement. All cash payments by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ shall be made in immediately available funds by confirmed wire transfer to a bank account or accounts designated by Seller or the Escrow Agent, as applicable. 

  

    
ARTICLE II 
_CLOSING_

  

 The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of Thompson and Knight LLP, Houston, Texas, at 10:00 a.m. (local Houston, Texas, time) on March 29, 2006, or (ii) at such other time or place or on such other date as the parties hereto shall agree. The date on which the Closing is required to take place is herein referred to as the "Closing Date." All Closing transactions shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously.

ARTICLE IX 
_BUYER\'S DUE DILIGENCE EXAMINATION_

   

    Section 9.1. _ _ _Title Due Diligence Examination._ 

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until 5:00 p.m. (local time in Houston, Texas) on March 24, 2006 (the "Examination Period"), the Company shall afford to Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the office, personnel and books and records of the Company and the Subsidiary in order for Buyer to conduct a title examination as it may in its sole discretion choose to conduct with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties in order to determine whether Title Defects (as defined below) exist ("Buyer\'s Title Review"); provided, however, that such investigation shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of the Company or the Subsidiary or impede the efforts of the Company and the Subsidiary to comply with its other obligations under this Agreement. Such books and records shall include all abstracts of title, title opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease files, assignments, division orders, operating records and agreements, well files, financial and accounting records, geological, geophysical and engineering records, in each case insofar as same may now be in existence and in the possession of the Company, excluding, however, any information that the Company or the Subsidiary is prohibited form disclosing by bona fide, third party confidentiality restrictions; provided, that if requested by Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary shall use their Reasonable Best Effort to obtain a waiver of any such restrictions in favor of Buyer. The cost and expense of Buyer\'s Title Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer shall not contact any of the customers or suppliers of the Company or the Subsidiary or their working interest co-owners or operators, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the specific prior authorization of the Company or the Subsidiary, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

        

 (b) If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any of the Oil and Gas Properties or the Option Acreage, Buyer shall notify the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period of such alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such notice ("Title Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe the Title Defect in reasonable detail (including any alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest), (iv) identify the specific Oil and Gas Property or Option Acreage affected by such Title Defect, and (v) include the value of such Title Defect as determined by Buyer in good faith. Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title Defects, but of which the Company has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes. Upon the receipt of such effective Title Defect Notice from Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary shall have the option, in addition to the remedies set forth in _Section 9.1(c)_ (the "Remedies for Title Defects"), but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Title Defect at any time prior to the Closing. The Oil and Gas Property affected by such uncured Title Defect shall be a "Title Defect Property". 

   

 (c) With respect to each Title Defect that is not cured on or before the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced, subject to this _Article IX,_ by the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title Defect Property. The "Title Defect Amount" shall mean, with respect to a Title Defect Property, the amount by which such Title Defect Property is impaired as a result of the existence of one or more Title Defects, which amount shall be determined as follows: 

  

  

 (i) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be determined by taking into consideration the "Allocated Value" (as set forth in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ attached hereto) of the Oil and Gas Property (or the Wells associated therewith) or Option Acreage (or the drilling locations located thereon) subject to such Title Defect, the portion of the Oil and Gas Property or Option Acreage subject to such Title Defect, and the legal effect of such Title Defect on the Oil and Gas Property (or the Wells associated therewith) or Option Acreage (or the drilling locations located thereon) affected thereby; provided, however, that: (A) if such Title Defect is in the nature of the Company\'s or the Subsidiary\'s Net Revenue Interest in an Oil and Gas Property being less than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ hereto and the Working Interest remains the same, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the Allocated Value for the relevant Oil and Gas Property (or the Wells associated therewith) multiplied by the percentage reduction in such Net Revenue Interest as a result of such Title Defect, or (B) if such Title Defect relates to the Option Acreage, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the Allocated Value for the drilling locations located on the Option Acreage, or (C) if such Title Defect is in the nature of a Lien, then the Title Defect Amount shall equal the amount required to fully discharge such Lien; and 

  

 (ii) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in _Section 9.1(c)(i)_, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the portion of the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property). 

  

  

 (d) As used in this _Section 9.1_: 

  

  

 (i) "Defensible Title" means, as of the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date:

 _Exhibit 9.1(c)_, through plugging, abandonment and salvage of all wells
comprising or included in such Oil and Gas Property, and except for changes or
adjustments that result from the establishment of units, changes in existing
units (or the participating areas therein), or the entry into of pooling or
unitization agreements after the date hereof unless made in breach of the
provisions of _Section 7.2_;

   

 2. obligates the Company or the Subsidiary to bear not greater than the percentage set forth in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ as the Company\'s or the Subsidiary\'s Working Interest of the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operation of each Lease comprising such Oil and Gas Property, through plugging, abandonment and salvage of all wells comprising or included in such Oil and Gas Property, and except for changes or adjustments that result from the establishment of units, changes in existing units (or the participating areas therein), or the entry into of pooling or unitization agreements after the date hereof unless made in breach of the provisions of _Section 7.2_; 

   

 3. is free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Encumbrances; and 

  

 4. reflects that all consents to assignment, notices of assignment or preferential purchase rights which are applicable to or must be complied with in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any prior sale, assignment or the transfer of such Oil and Gas Property, have been obtained and complied with to the extent the failure to obtain or comply with the same could render this transaction or any such sale, assignment or transfer (or any right or interest affected thereby) void or voidable or could result in Buyer, the Company, or the Subsidiary incurring any liability. 

    

 (B) with respect to the Option Acreage, such record title and ownership by Anadarko EandP Company LP, Anadarko Land Corp. (collectively, "Anadarko") of the mineral estate that would make such Option Acreage "Subject Lands", as such term in defined in the Exploration Agreement dated November 15, 2005 among Anadarko and the Subsidiary (the "Exploration Agreement").

normally actuated by an intent to abandon or release a lease and requiring
notice to the holders of such rights.

  

 (iii) "Title Defect" shall mean any particular defect in or failure of the Company\'s or the Subsidiary\'s ownership of any Oil and Gas Property or the inability to earn that portion of the Option Acreage described in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ by performance under the terms of the Exploration Agreement: (i) that causes the Company or the Subsidiary to not have Defensible Title to such Oil and Gas Property or causes Defensible Title to the Option Acreage to fail or causes the inability to earn that portion of the Option Acreage described in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ by performance under the terms of the Exploration Agreement, (ii) that has attributable thereto a Title Defect Amount in excess of $50,000 and (iii) regarding which a Title Defect Notice has been timely and otherwise validly delivered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be asserted as, a Title Defect: (A) defects or irregularities that have been cured or remedied by the applicable statutes of limitation or statutes for prescription; (B) defects or irregularities in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital status in documents or omissions of heirship proceedings; (C) minor defects or irregularities in title which for a period of five years or more have not delayed or prevented the Company or the Subsidiary (or the Company\'s or the Subsidiary\'s predecessor, if owned by the Company or the Subsidiary for less than five years) from receiving its Net Revenue Interest share of the proceeds of production and have not caused the Company or the Subsidiary to bear a share of expenses and costs greater than its Working Interest share from each Lease, unit or Well; (D) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to probate proceedings or the lack thereof which defects or irregularities have been outstanding for five years or more; and (E) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to any Oil and Gas Property that the Subsidiary has earned pursuant to the Exploration Agreement but which Anadarko has not yet assigned to the Subsidiary, as set forth on Section 9.1(d)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

  

 (e) If the Company and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to whether a Title Defect exists or, if it does exist, the Title Defect Amount attributable such Title Defect, the provisions of _Section 13.1_ shall be applicable. 

  

 (f) If the Company determines (or should Buyer, in the course of Buyer\'s Title Review, determine) that the Company\'s or the Subsidiary\'s Net Revenue Interest in an Oil and Gas Property is greater than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in _Exhibit 9.1(c)_ hereto and the Working Interest remains the same, then the parties agree that the Purchase Price shall be increased in an amount equal to the Allocated Value for the relevant Oil and Gas Property multiplied by the percentage increase in such Net Revenue Interest. 

       

    

    
 Section 9.2. _ _ _Environmental Due Diligence Examination._ 

  

 (a) Buyer shall have the right, or the right to cause an environmental consultant acceptable to Buyer in its sole discretion ("Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant"), to conduct an environmental review of the Properties prior to the expiration of the Examination Period ("Buyer\'s Environmental Review"). No less than three Business Days prior to the proposed commencement date of Buyer\'s Environmental Review, Buyer shall notify the Company of the commencement of its Environmental Review and shall coordinate the locations of such activities with the Company. The cost and expense of Buyer\'s Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. No Person, other than Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant and Buyer\'s employees may conduct Buyer\'s Environmental Review. The Company and the Subsidiary shall have the right to have representatives thereof present to observe Buyer\'s Environmental Review conducted in the Company Offices or on the Company\'s or the Subsidiary\'s properties. With respect to any samples taken in connection with Buyer\'s Environmental Review, the Company or the Subsidiary shall be permitted to take split samples. Buyer agrees to conduct Buyer\'s Environmental Review in a manner so as not to unduly interfere with the business operations of the Company or the Subsidiary and in compliance with all Applicable Laws, and Buyer shall exercise due care with respect to the Company\'s or the Subsidiary\'s properties and their condition. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, unless otherwise required by applicable law, Buyer shall (and shall cause Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, to) treat confidentially any matters revealed by Buyer\'s Environmental Review and any reports or data generated from such review (the "Environmental Information"), and Buyer shall not (and shall cause Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, to not) disclose any Environmental Information to any Governmental Entity or other third party without the prior written consent of the Company, except to the extent required by Applicable Law. Prior to the Closing, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer may use the Environmental Information only in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Buyer, Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, or any third party to whom Buyer has provided any Environmental Information become legally compelled to disclose any of the Environmental Information, Buyer shall provide the Company with prompt notice and the Company or the Subsidiary, at the Company\'s expense, may file any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the Environmental Information to the Company, which Environmental Information shall become the sole property of the Company and the Subsidiary. Upon the Company\'s written request to Buyer, Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental Information to the Company without charge. 

  

 (c) If Buyer or Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, discovers any Environmental Defect (as herein defined) prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, Buyer shall notify the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be effective, such notice (an "Environmental Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period; (iii) describe the Environmental Defect in reasonable detail, including (A) the specific Properties affected by or associated with such Environmental Defect, (B) if applicable, a site plan showing the location of all sampling events, boring logs and other field notes describing the sampling methods utilized and the field conditions observed, (C) the written conclusion of Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, that an Environmental Defect is believed to exist, which conclusion shall be reasonably substantiated by the factual data gathered in Buyer\'s Environmental Review, and (D) if feasible and applicable, a separate, reasonably specific citation of the provisions of the Environmental Laws alleged to be violated and the related facts that substantiate such violation; (iii) describe the procedures recommended to correct, eliminate or pay the Environmental Defect, together with any related recommendations from Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable; and (iv) set forth Buyer\'s good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, including the basis for such estimate. Any matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but of which the Company has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, together with any environmental matter that does not 

        
  

constitute an Environmental Defect, shall be deemed to have been waived by
Buyer for purposes of this _Section 9.2_. Upon the receipt of such effective
notice from Buyer, the Company shall have the option, in addition to the
remedy set forth in _Section 9.2(d)_, but not the obligation, to attempt to
cure such Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing, at the sole
cost and expense of Seller. If the Company and Buyer are unable to reach an
agreement as to whether an Environmental Defect exists or, if it does exist,
the amount of the Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto, the
provisions of _Section 13.1_ shall be applicable.

  

 (d) If any Environmental Defect described in a notice delivered in accordance with _Section 9.2_ is not cured on or before the Closing, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced, subject to this _Article IX_, by the Environmental Defect Value of such Environmental Defect. 

  

 (e) As used in this _Section 9.2_: 

  

  

 (i) "Environmental Defect" shall mean, with respect to any given Property, a violation of Environmental Laws in effect as of the date hereof in the jurisdiction in which such Property is located, an obligation under Environmental Laws to undertake within a reasonable period of time after Closing any corrective action at the Property, or any Environmental Liability arising from or attributable to any condition, event, circumstance, activity, practice, incident, action, or omission existing or occurring prior to the Closing Date, or the use, release, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of Hazardous Materials prior to the Closing Date, (A) regarding which an Environmental Defect Notice has been timely and otherwise validly delivered, (B) that has an Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto in excess of $100,000 and (C) is not otherwise disclosed in that certain report of HydroSolutions Inc. dated as of November 28, 2005, or that certain report of Environmental Consulting Services prepared by Summit Envirosolutions, Inc. dated as of July 11, 2005, copies of which have heretofore been provided by the Company to Buyer. 

  

 (ii) "Environmental Defect Value" shall mean, (A) the net present value of the reasonably estimated costs and expenses to correct such Environmental Defect in the most cost effective manner reasonably available, consistent with Environmental Laws, or (B) the net present value of the amount of Environmental Liabilities reasonably believed will be incurred or required to be paid by the Company or the Subsidiary with respect thereto. The parties recognize that the calculation of an Environmental Defect Value may require the use of assumptions and extrapolations; however, it is acknowledged and agreed that any such assumptions and extrapolations will be consistent with the known factual information and reasonable in nature. 

  

  

    
 Section 9.3. _ _ _Notice of Breaches of Representations and Warranties Pre-Closing._ If, in the course of conducting its due diligence examination of the Company and the Subsidiary prior to Closing (other than in connection with Buyer\'s Title Review and Buyer\'s Environmental Review), Buyer becomes aware of a breach of a representation and warranty made by any Seller, the Company, or the Subsidiary in this Agreement, Buyer shall give the Company prompt notice of such breach, which notice shall (i) describe in reasonable detail the nature of the asserted breach and (ii) specify the proposed Damages resulting from such asserted breach. The parties hereto shall endeavor in good faith to agree upon whether any breach of a representation and warranty made by Seller, the Company, or the Subsidiary in this Agreement asserted by Buyer is an actual breach and, if it is determined that there is an actual breach, the amount of the Damages attributable thereto. If, however, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, either on whether there is an actual breach or the amount of the Damages attributable thereto (as appropriate), the provisions of _Section 13.1_ shall be applicable. 

  

    
 Section 9.4. _ _ _Adjustments to Purchase Price for Title Defects, Environmental Defects and Breaches of Representations and Warranties._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i) if the aggregate of the Title Defect Amounts, Environmental Defect Values and Damages arising from a breach of a representation and warranty made by Seller, the Company, or the Subsidiary, as 

        

determined in accordance with this Agreement, is less than or equal to the
Deductible Amount, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made
therefore, and (ii) if the aggregate of the Title Defect Amounts,
Environmental Defect Values and Damages arising from a breach of a
representation and warranty made by Seller, the Company, or the Subsidiary, as
determined in accordance with this Agreement, is greater than the Deductible
Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the amount that
the aggregate of such Title Defect Amounts, Environmental Defect Values
and Damages exceeds the Deductible Amount.

   

    
 Section 9.5. _ _ _Option to Cure Title Defects Post-Closing._ 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company or the Subsidiary is not able to cure a Title Defect on or prior to Closing, Seller shall have the option, by notice in writing to Buyer on or before Closing, to attempt to cure such Title Defect after the Closing (with any such Title Defect being called a "Post-Closing Defect"). In such event, the transactions contemplated hereby will close as provided herein, but an amount equal to the Allocated Value for the Property to which the Post-Closing Defect pertains shall be deducted from the Adjusted Purchase Price otherwise payable at Closing and paid into an escrow account (the "Defects Escrow") established with a federally insured savings or banking institution mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the "Defects Escrow Agent") pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in a form acceptable to the Defects Escrow Agent and reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the "Defects Escrow Agreement"). The amount deposited into the Defects Escrow with respect to a Post-Closing Defect will remain therein until released as provided in _Section 9.5(b)_. 

   

 (b) Buyer, the Company, and the Subsidiary will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with Seller after the Closing to cure a Post-Closing Defect. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a Post-Closing Defect has been cured, then within two Business Days after such determination, the amount withheld in the Defects Escrow with respect thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) shall be released to Seller in accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a Post-Closing Defect has been partially cured, then Seller and Buyer shall mutually determine the portion of the amount retained in the Defects Escrow with respect thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) that should be paid to Buyer to compensate it for the uncured portion thereof (together with interest earned thereon), and the remaining portion of such amount shall be released to Seller (together with any interest earned thereon) in accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a Post-Closing Defect has not been cured, then within two Business Days after such determination, the amount withheld in the Defect Escrow with respect thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) shall be released to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If, at the end of the 180-day period commencing on the Closing Date (the "Cure Period"), Seller has been unable to cure a Post-Closing Defect (and there is no dispute as to whether or not it has been cured), the amount withheld in the Defect Escrow with respect thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) shall be released to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If, at the end of the Cure Period, Seller and Buyer are unable to agree whether there has been a satisfactory resolution of a Post-Closing Defect, then such disagreement shall be resolved as provided in _Section 13.1_. 

  

    
 Section 9.6. _ _ _Indemnification._ In connection with the conduct of its due diligence investigation of the Company, the Subsidiary, and the Properties and in consideration of the Company\'s and the Subsidiary\'s covenant under _Section 8.1_, Buyer hereby INDEMNIFIES and SHALL DEFEND AND HOLD the Company, the Subsidiary, Seller, Affiliates thereof, and their respective owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, contractors, successors, and assigns) HARMLESS from and against any and all of the following claims arising from Buyer\'s inspecting and observing the Properties: (i) claims for personal injuries to or death of employees of Buyer, its contractors, agents, consultants, and representatives, and damage to the property of Buyer or others acting on behalf of Buyer, except for injuries or death caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the

claims for personal injuries to or death of employees of the Buyer or third

THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING COMPLIES
WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

ARTICLE XII 
_SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS; INDEMNIFICATION_

  

    Section 12.1. _ _ _Survival._ 

  

 (a) Each representation, warranty and covenant of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely, except for (i) the representations and warranties of the Company and the Subsidiary contained in _Article IV_ (other than those set forth in _Section 4.12_), which shall survive the Closing for the twelve-month period commencing on the Closing Date, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company and the Subsidiary set forth in _Section 4.12_, which shall survive until the termination of the applicable limitations period, and (iii) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in _Article III_, which shall survive for the twelve-month period commencing the Closing Date. The period, if any, for which a representation, warranty and covenant survives is herein called the "Survival Period." 

  

 (b) No party hereto shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to this _Article XII_ or otherwise in respect of any representation, warranty or covenant unless it shall have received from the party seeking indemnification written notice of the existence of the claim for or in respect of which indemnification in respect of such representation, warranty or covenant is being sought on or prior to the expiration of the Survival Period applicable to such representation, warranty or covenant. Such notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity (i) the basis under this Agreement, and the facts that otherwise form the basis of such claim, (ii) the estimate of the amount of such claim (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim) and an explanation of the calculation of such estimate, including a statement of any significant assumptions employed therein, and (iii) the date on and manner in which the party delivering such notice became aware of the existence of such claim. 

  

    
 Section 12.2. _ _ _Indemnification by Seller._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article XII_, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, demands assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), of any nature whatsoever (collectively, "Damages"), asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by Buyer, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any breach by Seller of (i) its representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ or (ii) its covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. 

        

    
 Section 12.3. _ _ _Indemnification by Buyer._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article XII_, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all Damages, asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by Seller, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from (i) any breach by Buyer of its representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement and (ii) after Closing, the ownership and operation of the Company, the Subsidiary and their respective properties and other assets. 

  

    
 Section 12.4. _ _ _Indemnification Proceedings._ In the event that any claim or demand for which a party (an "Indemnifying Party"), would be liable to the another party under _Section 12.2_ or  _Section 12.3_ (an "Indemnified Party") is asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, but the failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article XII_, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such claim or demand is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from receipt of the above notice from the Indemnified Party (in this _Section 12.4_, the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Party\'s sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; provided, that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interest or those of the Indemnifying Party and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such claim or demand (or fails to give notice to the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such claim or demand with counsel of its own choice, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the claim or demand is asserted against both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and based on the advice of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party it is determined that there is a conflict of interest which renders it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for paying separate counsel for the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys to represent all of the Indemnified Parties, regardless of the number of Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such claim or demand, (i) no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party\'s written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).

The "Ultimate Per Unit Cost" shall be the base gathering rate between $0.32/Dkt and $0.65/Dkt that the Subsidiary is obligated to pay pursuant to the Gas Gathering Agreement after final resolution of the dispute disclosed on Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Kerr-McGee Dispute").
