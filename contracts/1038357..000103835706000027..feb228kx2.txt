connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller has
used reasonable efforts in preparing Schedules 3.4(c) and 3.4(d), which
identify Persons (and their addresses) who may hold preferential rights to
purchase affecting the Assets or rights to consent with respect to any
assignments required hereby in order the convey certain of the Assets, other
than such consents of governmental authorities, which are usually obtained
after Closing in the normal course of business. On or before the third
Business Day after the Execution Date, Seller, after consulting with
Purchaser regarding the form of the notice and the Persons to whom it shall
be sent, shall send notice to those Persons, if any, who may hold
preferential rights to purchase or rights to consent to assign as set
forth in Schedules 3.4(c) and 3.4(d) and provide Purchaser with a copy of all
such Notices. Seller shall send the notice of this Agreement to all such
Persons (i) offering to sell to each such Person the Asset for which a
preferential right is held, on and subject to the terms hereof (as may need
to be modified or conformed as needed for a specific Asset) and for the same
allocated value for such Asset as reflected on Exhibit "A", or (ii)
requesting, where appropriate, consent to any assignment required in
connection herewith in order to convey the Assets. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement and recognizing that Seller wants to sell
the entirety of the Assets in accordance herewith, Seller will have no
obligation to complete the sale of an Asset to a holder of a preferential
purchase right if Closing under this Agreement with Marubeni Offshore

purchase or consents to assign, exclusive of those set forth in Sections 3.4
(c) and (d) above but applicable to the contemplated transactions, are
discovered by Purchaser or Seller prior to Closing, Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to send notices as soon as
reasonably possible in accordance with this Section 3.10. Until Closing,
Seller shall be responsible for sending such notices and collecting responses
from each and every applicable Person, including but not limited to, lessors,
joint interest owners, farmors, sublessors, assignors, grantors, co-parties
to Related Agreements, Governmental Entities having jurisdiction, or third
parties, relating to approvals and consents and will provide Purchaser on or
before the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, with
copies of each consent, approval or waiver Seller has received. Seller and
Purchaser shall meet and agree on the form of all such notices; provided that
such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and if agreement
is not reached, Seller\'s form shall be used. If, prior to Closing, any
Person, in response to a notice from Seller asserts a preferential purchase
right and notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the
Asset to which it holds a preferential purchase right pursuant to the terms
and conditions hereof, or if the period allowed for acceptance of the notice
provided by Seller has not expired or will not expire as of Closing (subject
to Seller\'s right to extend the date of Closing), then such Subject
Properties shall be excluded at Closing from the Assets to be conveyed to
Purchaser under this Agreement and the    11      Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Subject Properties reflected
in Exhibit "A". All Assets for which all preferential purchase rights have
been waived or have not been accepted prior to expiration after timely notice
of the acceptance period by the holder of such right shall be sold to
Purchaser at Closing pursuant and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement. If one (1) or more of the holders of any preferential
purchase rights pertaining to the Assets, or any portion thereof, notifies
Seller or Purchaser subsequent to Closing that it intends to assert its
preferential purchase right, such notified Party shall give notice thereof to
the other party, whereupon Purchaser shall satisfy all such preferential
purchase right obligations to such holders including, but not limited to,
transferring the affected Assets to the holder of such rights and Purchaser
shall be entitled to receive upon satisfaction in full by Purchaser of all
the foregoing obligations all proceeds received from such holders in
connection with such preferential purchase rights. AT, UPON AND AFTER
CLOSING, PURCHASER SHALL INDEMNIFY, RELEASE, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER,
SELLER\'S AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES, SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS, FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS AND

and the transactions contemplated hereby may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing under the following conditions (subject to extensions allowed
Seller in this Agreement):   (a) [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]   (b) By mutual
written consent of the Parties; or   (c) By either Seller or Purchaser if
the consummation of the transactions  contemplated herein would violate any
nonappealable final order, decree or  judgment of any Governmental Entity
having appropriate jurisdiction  enjoining or awarding substantial damages in
connection with the  consummation of the transactions contemplated herein;
or   (d) [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]   (e) [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]   (f) By
Seller if any condition specified in Section 6.1 has not been  satisfied on
or before 5:00 p.m. on June 15, 2006, and shall not  theretofore have been
waived by Seller, provided that the failure to  consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on or before such date did  not result from the failure
by Seller to fulfill any undertaking or  commitment of Seller provided for in
Section 8.2 herein that is required to  be fulfilled on or prior to Closing
and provided further that the waiting  period required by the HSR Act shall
have expired or been terminated, if  applicable.   (g) By Purchaser if any
condition specified in Section 7.1 has not been  satisfied on or before 5:00
p.m. on June 15, 2006, and shall not  theretofore have been waived by
Purchaser, provided that the failure to  consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on or before such date did  not result from the failure
by Purchaser to fulfill any undertaking or  commitment of Purchaser provided
for herein that is required to be  fulfilled on or prior to Closing and
provided further that the waiting  period required by the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated, if  applicable.   (h) HSR Act. By either
Purchaser or Seller if the waiting period required  by the HSR Act shall not
have expired or been terminated, if applicable, on  or before September 15,
2006, where the Party seeking to terminate this  Agreement is not at fault
for the failure of the waiting period required by  the HSR Act to have
expired or be terminated.    34       10.2 Effect of Termination. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 2.4 or 10.1, this Agreement
shall become void and of no further force or effect (except for the
provisions of Sections 1.4, 2.4, 4.4, 4.14 (the third to the last and
penultimate sentences only), 5.4, Article 10 and Sections 13.1 through 13.11,
Sections 13.13, 13.14, 13.15, 13.16, 13.20, 13.21, 13.22 and 13.23, each of
which shall survive such termination and continue in full force and
effect). If Seller validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections
10.1(f) above, Seller may elect to retain the Deposit without further
liability or obligation to Purchaser and, upon such election, Seller shall
have the right to receive the Deposit from the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement and Purchaser shall cause the said Escrow Agent to release promptly
the Deposit to Seller. The Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser if this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Sections 10.1(b), (c), or (h) or
if validly terminated by Purchaser pursuant to 10.1(g). If Seller elects to
retain the Deposit, then such retention by Seller of the Deposit, all or in
part, shall be treated by the Parties as liquidated damages, in lieu of all
other damages or other remedies (it being agreed by the Parties that damages
in said event would be extremely difficult to determine and that the Deposit
retained by Seller represents a fair and reasonable estimate of such damages
to Seller under the circumstances and does not constitute a penalty). If the
Deposit is returned to Purchaser, Seller shall have no further obligation or
liability to Purchaser and PURCHASER COVENANTS NOT TO SUE SELLER, OR
SELLER\'S AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES OR INITIATE
LITIGATION OR OTHERWISE PURSUE ANY CLAIM AGAINST SELLER WITH REGARD TO ANY
DISPUTES, ISSUES OR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMINATION OF
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE
DEPOSIT (OR ANY PURPORTEDLY LOST INTEREST THEREON) OR SELLER\'S RETENTION OF
THE DEPOSIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 10.2. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, upon any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1, or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller
shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and
may sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any party
without any restriction under this Agreement and without any impairment of
its rights hereunder to recover damages from Purchaser arising from any
default hereunder by Purchaser; provided, that Seller\'s right to seek
specific performance of Purchaser\'s obligations hereunder shall be waived
upon any such disposition of the Assets and that its right to seek or recover
any other damages shall be waived upon its express election to retain the
Deposit in lieu of any other remedy against Purchaser.    ARTICLE 11.
TAXES  11.1 Apportionment of Ad Valorem and Property Taxes. All ad valorem
taxes, real property taxes, personal property taxes, and similar obligations
concerning the Assets with respect to the tax period in which the Effective
Time occurs ("Property Taxes") shall be apportioned as of the Effective Time
between Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed all
required reports and returns incident to the Property Taxes and shall pay or
cause to be paid to the taxing authorities all Property Taxes relating to the
tax period in which    35       the Effective Time occurs. Seller
shall pay to Purchaser Seller\'s pro rata portion of Property Taxes within
thirty (30) days after receipt of Seller\'s invoice therefor.  11.2 Sales
Taxes. The Purchase Price excludes any sales taxes or other taxes required to
be paid in connection with the sale of property pursuant to this Agreement.
If a determination is ever made that a sales tax or other transfer tax
applies, Purchaser shall be liable for all sales, gross receipts, use
and other taxes, conveyance, transfer and recording fees and real estate
transfer stamps or taxes that may be imposed on any transfer of property
pursuant to this Agreement. These taxes shall be collected and remitted under
applicable law. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller harmless
with respect to the payment of any of these taxes, if any, including any
interest or penalties assessed thereon. Seller will cooperate with Purchaser
in providing any documentation necessary for Purchaser to obtain an exemption
for such taxes.  11.3 Other Taxes. Income taxes, franchise and similar taxes
shall be the responsibility of the Party incurring same. Severance taxes
shall be allocated to each Party based on the ownership (as of the Effective
Time) of the hydrocarbon production giving rise to the liability. All taxes
(other than income taxes) that are imposed on or with respect to the
production of oil, natural gas or other hydrocarbons or minerals or the
receipt of proceeds therefrom (including but not limited to severance,
production, and excise taxes) shall be apportioned between the Parties based
upon the respective shares of production taken by the Parties as of the
Effective Time. From and after Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for
paying or withholding or causing to be paid or withheld all such taxes and
for filing all statements, returns, and documents incident thereto.  11.4
Cooperation. Each Party to this Agreement shall provide the other Party with
reasonable access to all relevant documents, data and other information which
may be required by the other Party for the purpose of preparing tax returns
and timely responding to any audit by any taxing jurisdiction. Each Party to
this Agreement shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the other
Party made in connection with contesting the imposition of
taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Party to this Agreement shall be required at any time to disclose to the
other Party any tax return or other confidential tax information.  11.5 Tax
Reporting. Seller and Purchaser agree that the Assets subject to
this Agreement do not constitute an "applicable asset acquisition" as
described under Internal Revenue Code section 1060 and the regulations
thereunder, and do not constitute a trade or business in the ordinary sense
of the term. Nevertheless, in the event that the Assets are determined by the
Internal Revenue Service (or any other regulatory body) to constitute an
"applicable asset acquisition," then both Seller and Purchaser agree and
proclaim that any and all transferred assets are limited to reserves in the
ground and tangible equipment and are "Class III Assets" and that there is no
"goodwill" or "going concern value" attached to the transferred assets. Both
Parties agree to the necessary and timely exchange of information required to
complete and timely file a Form 8594, and any other form required by the
Internal Revenue Service or any other regulatory agency.

(COLLECTIVELY "MMMF") MAY BE PRESENT AT SOME LOCATIONS. PURCHASER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NORM IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OIL AND
GAS FIELDS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. PURCHASER SHALL
MAKE ITS OWN DETERMINATION OF THIS PHENOMENON AND OTHER CONDITIONS. SELLER
DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PRESENCE OF
NORM OR MMMF ON OR AFFECTING THE ASSETS OR THE PROPERTY. AT CLOSING,
PURCHASER SHALL ASSUME THE RISK THAT THE ASSETS OR THE PROPERTY MAY CONTAIN
WASTES OR CONTAMINANTS AND ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING
THE PRESENCE OR LOCATION OF PIPELINES, EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ITEMS OF
PERSONAL PROPERTY, TANK BOTTOMS, HEATER TREATER SLUDGE, AND WASTES OR

DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY OR    37       PROPERTY DAMAGE) SHALL HAVE
OCCURRED OR MAY OCCUR, INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD SELLER AND SELLER\'S
AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES HARMLESS THEREFROM PURSUANT
TO THIS AGREEMENT.  12.3 Casualty Loss. Assuming Closing occurs and subject
to the provisions of Section 13.17, in the event of any damage by fire or
other casualty to any of the Assets between the Execution Date and the
Closing ("Casualty Loss"), this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and as to each affected Asset, Seller shall at its election either
collect (and when collected pay over to Purchaser) or assign to Purchaser any
and all insurance claims to the extent and only to the extent covering such
damage, and Purchaser shall take title to the affected Asset without
reduction in the Purchase Price.    ARTICLE 13. MISCELLANEOUS  13.1
Governing Law. This Agreement and all instruments executed in
accordance herewith shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law rules that

force and effect in accordance with its terms as to Purchaser and its
Affiliates only as it applies to Green Canyon Blocks 299 and 300 and any

Dallas County, Texas (the "Location").  13.23.5. If the Parties initiate
multiple arbitration proceedings, the subject  matters of which are related
by common questions of law or fact and  which could result in conflicting
