1.1 _The Share Purchase_.

 

(a) _Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the Sellers shall sell and transfer to Parent, or at Parents
direction, Acquirer, at the Closing, and Parent, or at Parents direction,
Acquirer, agrees to purchase from the Sellers, all of the Company Shares as of
immediately prior to the Closing, free and clear of all Encumbrances and with
all rights then attaching to them, including the right to receive all
distributions and dividends declared, paid, made or accruing on or after the
Closing, in exchange for (i) an amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest
cent), without interest, equal to the Closing Cash Consideration, less the
Deposited Amount; (ii) a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the Closing
Stock Consideration, less the Escrow Amount withheld pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 9.1_; (iii) the Contingent Consideration (if and to the extent payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_); and (iv) any portion of the Escrow Amount
released to the Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, in each case,
subject to any amount withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)_.

(b) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Acquirer, the Company, the Sellers and any
applicable Affiliate of Parent, Acquirer, the Company or the Sellers (each, a
" _Payor_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Payor
determines are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection
therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law
or under any other Applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld and paid or remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity in
accordance with Applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made. Except with respect to payments in
the nature of compensation, if a Payor determines that an amount is required
to be deducted and withheld, such Payor shall provide the payee with (a)
commercially reasonable notice of the Payors intent to deduct and withhold,
which shall include a copy of the calculation of the amount to be deducted and
withheld, and (b) a reasonable opportunity for the payee to provide forms or
other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding (or reduce
such withholding).

 



2

the closing of the Share Purchase (the " _Closing_ "), shall take place at
the London offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, which are located at 99

satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are
intended to be satisfied at the Closing) is less than twenty (20) Business
Days prior to the end of Parents fiscal quarter in which such date occurs,
then either Parent or SoftBank may, with written notice to the other party,

__ _ VII_ (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are intended to

those conditions) shall continue to be satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement on such Business Day), or (ii) such other date and time and/or
such other location as Parent and the Sellers agree in writing; _provided_ ,

or _Section_ __ _ 1.3(a)(ii)_.

consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and changes in cash flow
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, setting forth in each case in comparative

Earnout Party a statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, the Earnout
Partys good faith calculation of Revenue, EBITDA and the Earnout earned, if

Non-Earnout Party and its Representatives, including their independent
auditors, shall have executed all customary release letters reasonably
requested by the Earnout Partys independent auditors in connection
therewith), (B) the Earnout Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Non-
Earnout Party and its Representatives in connection with the review of the
Earnout Statement as is reasonably requested by the Non-Earnout Party, and (C)

the Earnout Statement on the basis that such item does not reflect, or has not
been made in a manner consistent with, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
1.3_;  _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ , the Non-Earnout Party shall notify
the Earnout Party in writing of each disputed item, and specify the amount

reasonable supporting documentation) and (y) specify, to the extent then
known, the amount that the Non-Earnout Party reasonably believes is the
correct Revenue, EBITDA or Earnout amount, as applicable, based on the
disagreements set forth in the notice of disputed items, including a
reasonably detailed description of the adjustments applied to the Earnout
Statement in calculating such amounts. The Non-Earnout Party shall be deemed
to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Earnout
Statement not so objected to in a notice of disputed items delivered within
the Earnout Review Period, and the failure by the Non-Earnout Party to provide
a notice of disputed items to the Earnout Party within the Earnout Review
Period will constitute the Non-Earnout Partys acceptance of all of the items
in the Earnout Statement and the Earnout Statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties as the final Earnout Statement.

(iii) If a notice of disputed items shall be validly delivered pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)(ii)_, the parties shall, during the thirty (30) days
following the date of such delivery (the " _Earnout Resolution Period_ "),
negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed items. During the Earnout
Resolution Period, the Earnout Party and its Representatives (including its
independent auditors) shall be permitted reasonable access during normal
business hours to the working papers of the Non-Earnout Party and its
independent auditors relating to the notice of disputed items ( _provided_ ,
_that_ , the Earnout Party and its Representatives, including its independent
auditors, have executed all customary release letters reasonably requested by
the Non-Earnout Partys independent auditors in connection therewith). To the
extent the disputed items are so resolved in writing within the
Earnout Resolution Period, then the Earnout Statement, as revised to
incorporate such changes as have been agreed between the Sellers and Parent,
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties as the final Earnout
Statement.

 

(iv) If the parties are unable to reach agreement by the end of the Earnout
Resolution Period, notwithstanding the provision in  _Section_ __ _ 10.12_
with respect to applicable substantive law, the parties shall refer all
unresolved disputed items to the Arbitration Panel for arbitration to be
conducted pursuant to the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)(iv)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.6(c)_. The parties shall instruct the Arbitration Panel to
make a determination with respect to each unresolved disputed item within
sixty (60) days 

 



6

    

 after its engagement by the Sellers and Parent to resolve such disputed
items, which determination shall be made in accordance with the rules set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)(iv)_. The Arbitration Panel shall make
its determination solely (A) on the documentation submitted by, and a single
presentation (any such documentation or presentation must be provided to the
other party prior to its submission or presentation to the Arbitration Panel)
made by each of the Sellers and Parent and (B) on the definitions of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and the related defined terms in this Agreement. The
parties shall instruct the Arbitration Panel to deliver to the Sellers and
Parent, within such sixty (60) day period, a written report setting forth its
adjustments, if any, to the Earnout Statement and the calculations supporting
such adjustments, and any such adjustments must be within the range of values
established for such disputed item in the Earnout Statement and the notice of
disputed items delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)(ii)_. Such report
shall be final, binding on the parties and conclusive on each of the Sellers
and Parent, absent manifest errors, and enforceable in a court of law,
effective as of the date the Arbitration Panels written determination is
received by the Sellers and Parent;  _provided_ , _that_ , nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_ is intended to, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_
shall be construed or interpreted to, limit any partys right to obtain any
remedies with respect to a breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the other parties pursuant to this Agreement. The
Arbitration Panel will award to the prevailing party all costs, fees and
expenses related to the arbitration, including reasonable fees and expenses
of attorneys, accountants and other professionals incurred by the prevailing
party, and judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitration Panel may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If, before the Arbitration
Panel renders its determination with respect to the disputed items in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)(iv)_, (x) the Sellers notify
Parent of their agreement with any items in the Earnout Statement previously
disputed by the Sellers, (y) Parent notifies the Sellers of its agreement with
any items in the Earnout Statement previously disputed by Parent, or (z) the
Sellers and Parent otherwise agree to resolution of any such items
in writing, then in each case such items as so agreed will be conclusive and
binding on the parties immediately upon such notice.

(d)  _Contingent Consideration Procedures_. Following the Earnout Period,
Parent shall pay to each Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the Contingent
Consideration (rounded down to the nearest cent or the nearest whole share, as
applicable), if any, in the form elected by the Sellers in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(e)_ and within the time period set forth in _Section_ __ _
1.3(e)_; _provided,_ _that_ , in the event the amount of the Contingent
Consideration is subject to any dispute, any undisputed portion(s) of the
Contingent Consideration shall be paid promptly (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after determination of such undisputed portion) by Parent,
with any disputed portion(s) paid in installment(s), in each case when and to
the extent such amounts are agreed or otherwise determined to be payable in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_.

 

(e) _Election of Contingent Consideration Form._ At SoftBanks election by
written notice to Parent no later than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Sellers may elect to receive payments of the Contingent
Consideration, if, as and when payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.3(d)_, in the form of either:

 



7

    

(i) cash to be paid by to each Seller by Parent in an amount equal to
such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the applicable Contingent Consideration
amount (rounded down to the nearest cent), within twelve (12) months after the
date that is the later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which
written agreement in respect of any amount of the Contingent Consideration is
reached or a determination is made by the Arbitration Panel in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_; or

 

(ii) Parent Stock, to be issued to each Seller by Parent, in each case in an
amount equal to such Sellers Pro Rata Share of (x) the applicable Contingent
Consideration amount _divided by_ (y) the Parent Stock Price (rounded down to
the nearest whole share), within ten (10) Business Days after the date that is
the later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which written
agreement in respect of any amount of the Contingent Consideration is reached
or a determination is made by the Arbitration Panel in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_;

 

 _provided_ , _that_ , if no such election is made, any payments of Contingent
Consideration shall be payable in the form of Parent Stock otherwise
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_.

(f) _Anti-Hedging._ Prior to the latest of (i) the Closing, (ii) the payment
of the Contingent Consideration or (iii) a final determination that no
Contingent Consideration is payable, the Sellers shall not, directly or
indirectly, engage in any swap, hedge, derivative instrument, or any
other agreement or any transaction that transfers, limits, caps, collars,
sets a floor, offsets or otherwise modifies, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, the economic consequences of ownership of any Parent Stock held by
the Sellers or their Affiliates or that they are entitled to or otherwise may
receive pursuant to this Agreement, _provided_ , _that_ after Closing the
Sellers and their Affiliates shall not be prohibited from pledging any Parent
Stock they own solely to secure a margin loan transaction for the purpose of
raising financing on Parent Stock owned by Seller(s), subject to compliance
with securities laws and provided it does not adversely impact any of their
obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement; and  _provided_ , _further_
, _that_ , this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(f)_ shall terminate at Closing and have no
effect thereafter if SoftBank elects to receive cash in payment of the
Contingent Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(e)_.

1.4 _Certain Taxes_.

prior to the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts so that each

authorizations and other corporate actions required to be taken by the
Company. Each Transaction Document to which the Company is a party has been

obligations of the Company herein or in any Transaction Document or to
complete the Transactions in accordance with this Agreement or any Transaction
Document and Applicable Law.

the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Business or to any of the assets

_(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(e)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ , _(k)_ , _(r)_ , _(t)_ , or _(u)_
 (solely with respect to any of the foregoing) if such action were taken by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, without the written
consent of Parent, between the Agreement Date and the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing.

 



14

    

(g) _Customer Audits_. During the last three (3) years (i) no audit has
been conducted by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries), except as would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. There is no material Order against the
Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective assets, or,

their employment, services or relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Legal
Proceeding pending against any other Person, except as would not be material

 material Company Employee Plan or to amend or terminate any existing
material Company Employee Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has at any time been, the employer or "connected with" or

intended to be Tax-qualified), actuarial reports, and financial statements);

requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as

Applicable Law and applicable accounting standards. Except as would not be

under a Company Employee Plan or otherwise, post-termination or post-
retirement life, health or welfare benefits to any person (other than
as required under Section 4980B of the Code or other similar Applicable Law).
The obligations of all material Company Employee Plans that provide health,
welfare or similar insurance are fully insured by third-party insurers.

 

(h) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance in
all material respects with all Applicable Law with respect to employment,
discrimination in employment, terms and conditions of employment, employee
benefits, worker classification, wages, pay slips, working hours, overtime and
overtime payments, working during rest days, social benefits

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its current or former
employees, independent contractors and consultants, where the liability to the
Company or its relevant Subsidiary for any such matter would reasonably be
expected to be in excess of $1,000,000.

(j) Other than as listed in  _Schedule 2.11(j)_ of the Seller Disclosure

the Company, no labor organization has attempted to negotiate a collective
bargaining agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the past
three (3) years. Other than as listed in _Schedule 2.11(j)_ of the Seller

local or foreign law or regulation regarding advanced notice or consultation
for mass layoffs or collective redundancies.

 

(l) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as may be required in order to
implement the Reorganizations, no terminations prior to the Closing Date in

Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988, as amended, and
any similar state or local law).

(m) Except as required pursuant to or contemplated by this Agreement or an
Offer Letter, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this

other event whether contingent or otherwise (including any termination of
service), will (i) result in any payment or benefit (including severance,
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due
or payable, or required to be provided by the Sellers, the Company or any

27

    

 Subsidiaries to any current or former employee, director, individual

Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or

misconduct in connection with such Persons employment, engagement or
appointment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no such allegation
is pending against any current director or officer, or, to the Knowledge of

Recipient makes no representation) has engaged, or will engage, in any
directed selling efforts (within the meaning of Regulation S under
the Securities Act) with respect to the Shares and they, their Affiliates and

pre-arranged with a buyer of the Shares located in the United States or with a
U.S. Person, and are not part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.

(i) _Registration_. Such Seller understands that the Shares have not
been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption
therefrom, and may not be transferred or resold except pursuant to an
effective registration statement or pursuant to an exemption from registration
or pursuant to Regulation S (and, in either such case, based upon an opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its counsel if so requested)

each Seller (as it relates to information about such Seller only) shall, to
the extent lawful, promptly notify Parent, and Parent shall promptly notify

shall not be taken into account in determining whether an inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations and warranties has occurred following the
Agreement Date that requires disclosure to the applicable party pursuant to
the terms set forth above; and _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ , a failure to
provide notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ shall not constitute a
breach of a covenant of Parent, the Sellers or the Company for purposes of
the condition in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, as
applicable);

(e) any material actions taken, or expected to be taken, by the Company

effect of such situation in relation to the Company or taking any action
related thereto that is required by Applicable Law; and

 

(f) any event, condition, fact or circumstance not covered by _clauses

knowingly encourage, facilitate, support or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain or continue any
communications (except solely to provide written notice as to the existence
of these provisions or to clarify the terms of any inquiry, expression of

inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would

connection with an Acquisition Proposal and request from each Person (other
than Parent and its Representatives) the prompt return or destruction of all
non-public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
previously provided to such Person in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal. If any Representative, whether in his, her or its capacity as such
or in any other capacity, takes any action (on the Companys, any of its
Subsidiaries or a Sellers behalf or at their direction) that the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or a Seller is obligated pursuant to this _Section_ __

this Agreement to have breached this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

(b) The Company and each Seller shall immediately (but in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing after learning of
receipt by it (or, to the knowledge of it, by any of its Representatives), of

reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, other than Parent
and its Representatives. Such notice shall describe (A) the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal, offer, notice or request and (B) the identity of the Person or Group
making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal, offer, notice or request. The sender of such notice shall keep
Parent fully informed of the status and details of, and any modification to,
any such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and any
correspondence or communications related thereto and shall provide to Parent a
true, correct and complete copy of such inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal or offer and any amendments, correspondence and communications
related thereto, if it is in writing, or a reasonable written summary thereof,
if it is not in writing. The delivery by the Sellers or the Company to Parent
of any notices pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ shall not limit or
modify the obligations of the Sellers and the Company pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 6.1(a)_.

 



55

    

6.2 _Non-compete;  Non-solicitation_. In further consideration for the
payment of the Aggregate Consideration and in order to protect the value of
the Company Shares purchased by Acquirer (including the goodwill inherent
in the Company and each Subsidiary as of the Closing), upon the Closing
contemplated by this Agreement, each Seller agrees, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, as follows:

 

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that it has become, and following the date hereof
shall continue to be, familiar with Confidential Information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Therefore, each Seller agrees that from the
Agreement Date through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-compete Period_"),
it shall not (and shall not take any steps toward or preparations in respect
of), directly or indirectly, either for itself or for any other Person, own,
manage, control, participate in, invest in, or permit its name to be used by,
any Person primarily engaged in and deriving greater than 50% of its revenues
from, the design, development, manufacture, production, marketing and sale of
semiconductor products and related services intended to compete with either
the Arm ISA or X86 ecosystems, including but not limited to semiconductor
products and related services related to RISC-V. For purposes of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the foregoing activities include any direct or indirect
interest in any enterprise, whether as a director, partner, agent,
representative, stockholder, creditor, or owner; _provided_ , _that_ ,
the foregoing activities shall not include passive ownership of less than ten
percent (10%) of the stock of a publicly held corporation whose stock is
traded on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter market.
During the Non-compete Period, each Seller shall not directly or indirectly
through another Person (i) call on, solicit, or service any customer,
supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of the Company or any
Subsidiary (a " _Business Client_ ") with respect to products or services that
have been provided by the Company or any Subsidiary, are currently being
provided by the Company or any Subsidiary or which the Company or
any Subsidiary is currently in the process of developing; or (ii) encourage,
induce or solicit, or attempt to encourage, induce or solicit, any Business
Client to cease doing business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Each Seller represents and warrants to Parent that since August 18, 2020,
such Seller and its controlled Affiliates have not solicited any Covered
Employees in violation of the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and there
are currently no outstanding offers of employment from such Seller or its
controlled Affiliates to any Covered Employee.

 

(c) Parent represents and warrants to the Sellers that, since August 18, 2020,
Parent and its controlled Affiliates have not solicited any Covered Employees
in violation of the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and there are
currently no outstanding offers of employment from Parent or its controlled
Affiliates to any Covered Employee.

 

(d) From the Agreement Date through the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, without prior
written consent of Parent, each Seller shall not (and shall cause its directly
and indirectly controlled Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly, (i)
encourage, induce, solicit or attempt to encourage, induce or solicit
any Covered Employee to leave the employment of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) hire or employ any Covered Employee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , _that_ , this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ shall not preclude
any Seller or its directly and indirectly controlled Affiliates placing
general solicitation, mass advertisement or similar type of broad-based
publicly-disseminated solicitation through advertisement or search firms that
is not directed specifically toward the Covered Employees.

 



56

    

(e) From the Agreement Date through the earlier of (i) the later of (1)
August 18, 2021, or (2) the termination of this Agreement or (ii) the Closing,
without the prior written consent of the Sellers, Parent shall not (and shall
cause its directly and indirectly controlled Affiliates not to), directly or
indirectly, (x) encourage, induce, solicit or attempt to encourage, induce or
solicit any Covered Employee to leave the employment of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (y) hire or employ any Covered Employee;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , _that_ , this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_ shall not preclude Parent or
its directly and indirectly controlled Affiliates from placing general
solicitation, mass advertisement or similar type of broad-based publicly-
disseminated solicitation through advertisement or search firms that is not
directed specifically toward the Covered Employees.

 

(f) Each party acknowledges and represents that: (i) sufficient consideration
has been given by each party to this Agreement to the other as it relates
hereto; (ii) such party has consulted with independent legal counsel regarding
its rights and obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_; (iii) such party
fully understands the terms and conditions contained herein; (iv) the scope
of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries is independent of location
(such that it is not practical to limit the restrictions contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ to a specified country, city or part thereof); (v) the
restrictions and agreements in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ are reasonable in all
respects and necessary for the protection of the parties, and their
Confidential Information and goodwill and that, without such protection, the
parties employees, customer and client relationships and competitive
advantage would be materially adversely affected; and (vi) the agreements in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ are an essential inducement to the parties to enter
into this Agreement and they are in addition to, rather than in lieu of, any
similar or related covenants to which the parties are bound.

 

(g) If at any time a court or arbitrators award holds that the restrictions
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ are unreasonable under circumstances then
existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or
geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for
the stated period, scope or area. The parties hereto agree that any breach of
the provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ will result in serious
and irreparable injury and therefore money damages would not be an adequate
remedy for any such breach. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach of any provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ that is continuing, the
Company, Sellers, Parent and their respective successors and assigns and any
third-party beneficiary to this Agreement, in addition to other rights and
remedies existing in their favor, shall be entitled to specific performance or
injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of,
the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security). In addition,
in the event of a breach or violation by any party of this _Section_ __ _
6.2_, the Non-compete Period shall be tolled until such breach or violation
has been duly cured.

 

6.3 _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent, the Sellers and the Company
have previously executed a non-disclosure agreement, dated as of May 21, 2020
as amended on August 18, 2020 and a clean team agreement, dated as of August
6, 2020 (collectively, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. At no time
shall any party hereto disclose any of the terms of this Agreement (including
the economic terms) or any non-public information about a party hereto to any
other Person without the prior written consent of the party hereto about which
such non-public information 

 



57

    

 relates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, a party
hereto shall be permitted to disclose any and all terms to its financial, tax
and legal advisors (each of whom is subject to a similar obligation of
confidentiality), and to the extent necessary or advisable in compliance with
Applicable Law and the rules of any applicable stock exchange (including
Nasdaq and Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.). With respect to the Sellers, as used
in the Confidentiality Agreement, the term " _Confidential Information_ "
shall also include information relating to the Share Purchase or this
Agreement received by the Sellers after the Closing or relating to the period
after the Closing.

(b) Parent and the Sellers have agreed upon the initial joint press release
and other public communications with respect to the execution of this
Agreement, and will issue such press release and public communications
promptly following the execution of this Agreement (the " _Joint
Communications_ "). Other than the Joint Communications, the Sellers and the
Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives not to, issue any press release or other public
communications relating to the terms of this Agreement or the Transactions,
without the prior written approval of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (i) the Sellers
determine after consultation with outside counsel that it is required by
Applicable Law (in which event written notice to that effect shall be first
delivered to Parent prior to any such disclosure), (ii) that it consists
solely of information previously disclosed in all material respects in
previous press releases and public communications in compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ or (iii) except as reasonably necessary for the
Sellers and the Company to obtain the consents and approvals of Third Parties
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, each of SoftBank and
Parent may make such public communications regarding this Agreement or the
Transactions as such party may determine (A) is reasonably appropriate to
comply with Applicable Law, or with the rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange or
Nasdaq; (B) that consist solely of information previously disclosed in all
material respects in previous press releases and public communications in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_; (C) solely with respect to
Parent, are reasonably appropriate in connection with the regulatory approval
process, except, in each case subject to prior consultation with the Sellers
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.4(g)_; (D) are in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in all material
respects in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made by Parent or the Sellers in compliance with this  _Section_ __ _
6.3(b)_ and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other
parties, this Agreement or the Transactions. Furthermore, Parent may make such
public communications as it determines reasonably appropriate subject to
prior consultation with SoftBank and compliance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

pre-submission consultation procedures for, any applications notices,
petitions or filings with the Specified Regulatory Authorities (and thereafter
make any other required submissions and respond as promptly as reasonably

change in any Applicable Law following the Agreement Date, any Governmental
Entity under any other Applicable Law in connection with the Transactions, and
if so, to prepare and file any such filings and to seek any such other
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations (the filings described in the
foregoing _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and any filings agreed by the parties pursuant
to _(C)_ collectively, the " _Regulatory Filings_ " and any authorizations,
clearances, consents, approvals or expiration or early termination of the
applicable waiting period with respect to such Regulatory Filings, the "
_Regulatory Approvals_ "). Parent shall pay any fees associated with the
Regulatory Filings.

 



59

    

(d) If any Legal Proceeding is instituted challenging the Transactions as in
violation of any Antitrust Law, the parties shall cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to support one another in contesting and
resisting any such action, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other governmental Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts consummation
of the Transactions, unless Parent, after good faith consultation with the
Sellers, concludes that litigation is not the best strategy for securing the
Regulatory Approvals.

 

(e) In furtherance to and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent,
Acquirer, the Sellers and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken all lawful actions necessary to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals of the Transactions or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) in connection
therewith in order for the parties to consummate the Transactions prior to
the Termination Date (as the same may be extended). Notwithstanding anything

Order that would make the Transactions unlawful or would otherwise materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) terminate, modify,
or assign existing relationships, Contracts, or obligations relating to
any assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this
Agreement, or (iii) change or modify any course of conduct regarding future

this Agreement (any one of the foregoing, a " _Remedy_ "), in each case
except as set forth on _Schedule 6.4(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.
Neither Parent nor the Sellers shall be required to (and the Sellers and its
Affiliates shall not, without Parents prior consent) agree to any term or
take or omit to take any action in connection with obtaining the approval of
any Governmental Entity that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
Share Purchase.

 

(f) To the extent requested by Parent, the Sellers and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, make or enter into any Remedies, or any other actions
reasonably determined by Parent, in each case as necessary to obtain the

Sellers or the Company to any Governmental Entity under or relating to the
Transactions, (ii) the Sellers shall have the right, to the extent feasible,

Sellers with respect to such filings, (iii) the Sellers and the Company shall
cooperate fully with Parent with respect to the strategy and direction of all

such Governmental Entity, grant Parent the opportunity to attend and lead the
discussions at such contact, communication or meeting or (B) proffer, make
proposals, negotiate, execute, carry out or submit to any agreements or Orders

such meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party
shall provide to the other (or the others respective advisors) upon request

agreements, arrangements, programs and policies established or maintained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates on or after the Closing (to the same extent
as such credit was recognized prior to the Closing under comparable Company
Employee Plans), except where granting such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits.

 

(f) In addition, Parent hereby agrees that Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition
exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under

participation under such New Plans in the year of initial participation (to
the same extent such credit would have been given under comparable Company
Employee Plans prior to the Closing).

_6.12_ and _6.13_ ) shall, or shall be construed so as to, (i) prevent or
restrict in any way the right of Parent or Acquirer to terminate,
reassign, promote or demote any employee, consultant, director or other
service provider (or to cause any of the foregoing actions) at any time
following the Closing, or to change (or cause the change of) the title,
powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other
compensation or terms or conditions of employment or service of any such
employee, consultant, director or other service provider at any time following
the Closing, (ii) constitute an amendment or modification of any Company
Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan, (iii) create any third-party
rights in any such current or former employee, consultant, director or other
service provider (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), (iv)
obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to adopt or maintain any particular
plan or program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or
prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates from modifying or terminating any
such plan, program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time,
or (v) limit or modify the obligations of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under Applicable Law or any applicable

Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between the Sellers and Parent
in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.14(f)_. In
the event that Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) receives such a refund to which the Sellers
are entitled pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(m)_,
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid such amounts (including any interest paid
thereon) to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares
within ten (10) days of the receipt of the refund.

circumstance that such party may reasonably expect would cause the Share
Purchase to not qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment at the Closing Date,
then such party shall promptly notify the other parties. The Company and the
Sellers agree to execute certificates containing reasonably requested
representations, assumptions and undertakings at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by Tax counsel of Parent that are in form and substance
acceptable to Parent in connection with the Intended Tax Treatment. The
parties agree to treat and report the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, for all United States federal and applicable state, local and non-
United States income Tax purposes (including on all applicable Tax Returns),
in accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment, except upon a contrary final

Parent in its sole and absolute discretion shall be permitted to (but shall
have no obligation to) make or cause any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to make elections under Section 338 of the Code
with respect to the Share Purchase. The Sellers shall cooperate in good faith
with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
and use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) with any assistance
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with making such elections with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries. In the event of a statutory change
in Law to Section 338 of the Code affecting the calculation of Taxes of the
Company or its Subsidiaries which, based on documentation reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and provided by the Sellers, would have a materially
adverse impact on the Sellers, Parent agrees to consult with the Sellers, and
consider the consequences of any election under Section 338 of the Code with
respect to the Share Purchase under this Agreement.

(l)  _Post_ _-Closing Actions_. Except as required by Applicable Law or in
the Ordinary Course (as determined, in each case, in good faith following
consultation with the Sellers), without the prior written consent of the
Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed), in each case to the extent such action would reasonably be expected
to materially increase Taxes for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), to: (i)
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action on the Closing
Date after the Closing outside of the Ordinary Course (other than actions
contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) amend any Tax Return of the Company or
its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) make any Tax election
(other than any election under Section 338 of the Code for the Company or its

under _Section_ __ _ 6.14(h)_) with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, which Tax election would be effective for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (iv) voluntarily approach any Tax Authority on or after the Closing
Date with respect to any Tax position taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries
on a Tax Return solely with respect to a Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date or (v) change any annual Tax accounting period or adopt or change
any material Tax accounting method, in each case, with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

(m) The Sellers shall provide any reasonably requested Code Section 1445 or
Code Section 1446(f) certificates with respect to any Subsidiary of the
Company taking into account transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

cooperate in good faith with Parent to determine whether the Company is a
"passive foreign investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the

reasonable representations and documentation as Parent may request with
respect to such determination.

payments from Parent that could constitute "parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) in connection with the Transactions.
Promptly following the execution of this Agreement (but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing), the Company shall obtain
and deliver to Parent, prior to initiation of the 280G Shareholder Approval
process, a Parachute Payment Waiver from each "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) who may receive any payments
or benefits that could constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) in connection with the Transactions. Promptly
following the delivery of the Parachute Payment Waivers to Parent (but in no
event less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing), the Company
shall submit to the Sellers for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code), by such number of holders of the Sellers as is required by the
terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that
may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code (" _Section_ __ _ 280G Payments_"), such that
such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments,
and prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent notification and
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent that (i) a vote of the
holders of Company Shares was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite
shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits
that were subject to the shareholder vote (the " _280G Shareholder Approval_
") or (ii) that the 280G Shareholder Approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided
to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G
Payments, pursuant to the Parachute Payment Waivers that were executed by the
affected individuals prior to the vote of the holders of Company Shares
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.15_. The form of the waiver, the
disclosure statement, and the calculations related to the foregoing shall be
subject to advance review and approval by Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

_Escrow Agent_ ") (the aggregate value of the Escrow Amount so held by Escrow
Agent from time to time, the " _Escrow Fund_ "), which Escrow Fund shall be
governed by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall
constitute partial security for the benefit of Parent and Acquirer (on behalf
of itself or any other Indemnified Person) with respect to any indemnifiable
Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the Sellers (each a "
_Seller Indemnifying Party_ " and, together with Parent, an " _Indemnifying

Escrow Fund. Neither the Escrow Fund (including any portion thereof) nor any
beneficial interest therein may be pledged, subjected to any Encumbrance,
sold, assigned or transferred by any party or be taken or reached by any
legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other Liability of
any party, in each case prior to the distribution of the Escrow Fund to such
party in accordance with this _Article IX_.

 

(b) Within five (5) Business Days following the Escrow Release Date, the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, will distribute

reasonable judgment of Parent, to be necessary to satisfy all unsatisfied or
disputed claims for indemnification specified in any Claim Certificate
delivered by Parent to the Sellers on or prior to the Escrow Release Date in
accordance with this _Article IX_ , which portion shall remain in the Escrow
Fund until such claims for Damages have been resolved or satisfied. Any
portion of the Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent following the Escrow
Release Date with respect to pending but unresolved claims for indemnification
that is not awarded to Parent upon the resolution of such claims shall be
distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers within five (5) Business Days
following resolution of such claims and in accordance with such Sellerss Pro
Rata Share of such portion of the Escrow Fund.

9.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article IX_ , from and after

reimburse each Indemnified Person for, any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, fees, Taxes, interest, costs and expenses (including costs
of investigation, defense and enforcement and reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, experts and other professionals), whether sustained, incurred or
otherwise suffered directly or indirectly and whether or not due to a Third-

warranties shall be true and correct as of such date or dates), in each case,
except for the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _

relationship or transaction giving rise to such liability first arose prior

Sellers or of their direct or indirect owners (including any direct or
indirect capital gains Taxes arising as a result of the transactions

Laws;

Person for, any and all Damages, arising out, resulting from or in connection
with:

9.4_, the period (the " _Claims Period_ ") during which claims may be made:
(i) for Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the

at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the date
that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date; (ii) for Damages arising out
of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in _clauses (i)_

9.5 _Claims_.

 

(a) From time to time during the Claims Period, Parent may deliver to the
Sellers or the Sellers may deliver to Parent, one or more certificates signed
by any officer of such party (each, a " _Claim_ _Certificate_ "):

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or
accrued, or in good faith believes that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue,
Damages (or that with respect to any Tax Matters, that any Tax Authority may
raise such matter in an audit of Parent or Acquirer or the Affiliates of
either, that could give rise to Damages);

(ii) stating the amount of such Damages (which, in the case of Damages not
yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may, if known or estimable, be the
maximum amount believed by Parent in good faith to be incurred, paid,
reserved, accrued or demanded by a Third Party); and

 



91

    

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information
then possessed by Parent) the individual items of such Damages included in
the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such Damages are
related if known or estimable.

 

(b) Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such officer of Parent as of the date thereof, (ii) shall not
limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect to
the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such Claim
Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to time by Parent
by delivering any updated or amended Claim Certificate, so long as the
delivery of the original Claim Certificate is made within the applicable
Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to the underlying facts and
circumstances specifically set forth in such original Claims Certificate;
_provided_ , _that_ , all claims for Damages properly set forth in a Claim
Certificate or any update or amendment thereto shall remain outstanding until
such claims have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the expiration
of such Claims Period. No delay in providing such Claim Certificate within the
applicable Claims Period shall affect an Indemnified Persons rights
hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Sellers or the
Indemnifying Parties are materially prejudiced thereby.

9.6 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_. 

(a) If the Sellers (on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties) do not
contest, by written notice to Parent, any claim or claims by Parent (on
behalf of the Parent Indemnified Persons) made in any Claim Certificate within
the thirty (30) day period following receipt of the Claim Certificate, then
Parent and the Sellers shall promptly prepare, sign and deliver to the
Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to distribute to Parent an amount of
cash from the Escrow Fund having a total value equal to the amount of any
indemnifiable Damages hereunder corresponding to such claim or claims as set
forth in such Claim Certificate. If Parent does not contest, by written
notice to the Sellers, any claim or claims by the Sellers (on behalf of the
Seller Indemnified Persons) made in any Claim Certificate within the thirty
(30) day period following receipt of the Claim Certificate, then Parent shall
promptly pay to each Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the amount of any
indemnifiable Damages hereunder corresponding to such claim or claims as set
forth in such Claim Certificate, in cash by wire transfer to the Seller Bank
Accounts.

(b) If the Sellers (on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties) or Parent
object in writing to any claim or claims made by a Parent Indemnified Person
or Seller Indemnified Person, respectively, in any Claim Certificate within
the thirty (30) day period set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.6(a)_, Parent and
the Sellers shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days after the
applicable partys receipt of such written objection to resolve such
objection. If Parent and the Sellers shall so agree with respect to a claim by
a Parent Indemnified Person, a joint written instruction setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parent and the Sellers and
delivered to the Escrow Agent. Upon receipt of such joint written instruction,
the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent an amount in cash from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms of such joint written instruction.

 



92

    

(c) If no such agreement can be reached during the sixty (60) day period for
good faith negotiation set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_, but in any event
upon the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, such dispute shall be
finally settled by binding arbitration. The seat, or legal place, of
arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. Such arbitration shall be
conducted in English in accordance with the CPR Arbitration Procedure
(currently in effect) by three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with
such rules (the " _Arbitration Panel_ "). Notwithstanding the provision in
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_ with respect to applicable substantive law, any
arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.6(c)_
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., SECS. 1-16). The
Arbitration Panel shall allow such discovery as is appropriate to the purposes
of arbitration in accomplishing a fair, speedy and cost-effective resolution
of the dispute. The award of arbitration shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto. The Arbitration Panel will award to the prevailing party all
costs, fees and expenses related to the arbitration, including reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other professionals incurred
by the prevailing party, and judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitration
Panel may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The decision of
the Arbitration Panel as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Claim Certificate shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the
parties hereto and the Indemnifying Parties, and Parent shall be entitled to
instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent an amount in cash from the
Escrow Fund equal to any arbitral award in favor of Parent.

 

(d) Judgment upon any determination of an Arbitration Panel may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.6(d)_,
in any suit hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the
Claim Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the prevailing
party unless the Arbitration Panel determines in favor of the Sellers (on
behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties) with respect to more than one-half
of the amount in dispute, in which case the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall
be deemed to be the prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an
arbitration shall pay its own fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of
the prevailing party, including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred
in connection with such suit.

9.7 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a claim by a
Third Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that Parent in good faith believes
may result in a claim for Damages by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person,
Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of
and to settle or resolve such Third-Party Claim and the costs and expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution
(including attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court
or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Damages for which Parent shall
be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder. The
Sellers shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent that
receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating to any
Indemnified Person, subject to execution by the Sellers of Parents (and, if
required, such Third Partys) standard non-disclosure agreement to the extent
that such materials contain confidential or propriety information. However,
Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine and conduct
the defense of any Third-Party Claim and the settlement, adjustment or
compromise of such Third-Party Claim. Unless otherwise consented to in writing
in advance by Parent in its sole discretion, the Sellers and their Affiliates
may not participate in any Third-Party Claim or any action related to such
Third-Party Claim (including any discussions or negotiations in connection
with the settlement, adjustment or compromise thereof). In the event that the
Sellers have consented to the amount of any settlement or resolution by
Parent of any such claim (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 



93

    

 conditioned or delayed and which consent shall be deemed to have been given
unless the Sellers shall have objected within twenty (20) days after a written
request therefor by Parent), or if the Sellers shall have been determined to
have unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed its consent to the amount
of any such settlement or resolution, the Sellers and Indemnifying Party (a)
shall not have any power or authority to object under this _Article IX_ to
the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person against the
Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution, (b)
shall be deemed to have approved the related Claim Certificate and (iii)
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent an amount in cash from
the Escrow Fund equal to the applicable Damages with respect to such Third-
Party Claim.

 

9.8 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Indemnifying Parties agree to
treat (and cause their respective Affiliates to treat) any payment received
by the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Article IX_ as adjustments to the
Aggregate Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted
by Applicable Law.

written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof (except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue
in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
in accordance with its terms), and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall
not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.20_
( _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance and Indemnification_ ) and
that _Article IX_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified Persons. Except as

that it is not relying on any other statement, warranty, assurance or
undertaking made or given by any Person, in writing or otherwise, at any time

wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Acquirer without the prior consent of any
other party hereto; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding any such assignment,
Parent and/or Acquirer, as applicable, shall remain liable for all of its
obligations under this Agreement, save to the extent such obligations are

sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



99

    

10.9 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

10.10 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party hereto of any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the
requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described
herein.

 

10.11 _Waiver and Release of Claims_.

 

(a) Effective for all purposes as of the Closing, each Seller acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself and each of its agents, trustees, beneficiaries,
directors, officers, controlled Affiliates, Subsidiaries, estate, successors
and assigns (each, a " _Releasing Party_ ") that each hereby releases and
forever discharges the Company and its Subsidiaries, directors, officers,
employees, representatives, agents, successors, predecessors and assigns
(each, a " _Released Party_ " and collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ")
from any and all Seller Claims such Releasing Party may have or assert it has
against any of the Released Parties, from the beginning of time through the
time of the Closing and following the Closing, in each case whether known or
unknown, or whether or not the facts that could give rise to or support a
Seller Claim are known or should have been known, except with regard to its
rights pursuant to the Transaction Documents, the ISG Reorganization Documents
and the transactions contemplated thereby. In this Agreement a "
_Seller Claim_ " shall mean any all past, present and future disputes,
claims, controversies, demands, rights, obligations, liabilities, damages,
suits, actions and causes of action of every kind and nature, including, any
unknown, unsuspected or undisclosed claim as a result of any act, omission,
circumstance or matter, that has occurred or existing at any time prior to the
Closing.

 

(b) Each Seller, on behalf of each Releasing Party, further covenants and
agrees that such Releasing Party has not heretofore sold, transferred,
hypothecated, conveyed or assigned, and shall not hereafter sue any Released
Party upon, any Seller Claim released under this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_; and
that each Releasing Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the Released
Parties against any loss or liability on account of any actions brought by
such Releasing Party or such Releasing Partys assigns or prosecuted on behalf
of such Releasing Party and relating to any Seller Claim released under this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.11(b)_. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that the
limitations on liability set forth in _Article IX_ shall not apply to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.11_.

 



100

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary: (i) the foregoing release is
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing and shall become null and
void, and shall have no effect, without any action on the part of any Person,
upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ ; and
(ii) should any provision of this release be found, held, declared,
determined, or deemed by any court of competent jurisdiction to be void,
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or controlling
law, the legality, validity, and enforceability of the remaining provisions
will not be affected and the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision will
be deemed not to be a part of this release.

 

10.12 _Governing Law_ _; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York without reference to such states principles of
conflicts of law that would refer a matter to a different jurisdiction.

(b) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)(iv)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.6(c)_, with
respect to any suit, action or proceeding relation to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (each a " _Proceeding_ "), each party
irrevocably (i) agrees and consents to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or, if for any reason the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any New York
State court sitting in New York City and any direct appellate courts therefrom
and (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of
venue of any Proceeding brought in any such court, waives any claim that such
Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the
