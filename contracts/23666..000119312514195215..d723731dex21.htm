ARTICLE II

_EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger Corp_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of any Securities of the Company or Merger Corp:

 

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly,
by Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or otherwise)
or either Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(a), and (ii) subject to the provisions of Section
2.4, Appraisal Shares) shall at the Effective Time be converted into the right
to receive (x) $18.00 in cash, without interest (such amount of cash, as may
be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2, the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ "), and (y)
0.5 (such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2, the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent
Common Stock (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.3) (the consideration
payable in accordance with this Section 2.1(b), collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.1 shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of (1) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or (2) shares of
Company Common Stock held in book entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (subject to Section
2.4) the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) any other
amounts expressly provided herein, without interest, subject to compliance
with the procedures set forth in Section 2.5. 

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Corp issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



4 Section 2.2 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time or (ii) any termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the
Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Common
Stock and Company Restricted Shares) the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall
be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.3 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.
All fractional shares to which a single record holder of Company Common Stock
would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations
shall be rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the
amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder would, but for this Section 2.3, be entitled under Section
2.1(b) and (B) an amount equal to the average of the volume weighted average
price per share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("
_NYSE_ ") (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on
each of the ten consecutive trading days ending with the third complete
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts,
without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
such cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant
to this Section 2.3 is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1, but
rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the
Surviving Entity of the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder 

 



5  shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right
to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1. The Company shall provide
reasonably prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by the
Company. Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.5  _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
and shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, through the Exchange Agent, subject to Section 2.5(b)(ii), book-entry
shares (or certificates if requested) representing the full number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange
for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent cash
in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange
Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (such shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that
there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund,
from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.3. The Exchange Agent shall
deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of
the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in Section 2.5(h), the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of record
of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange

 



6  Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as
promptly as practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash
Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in book entry form unless a certificate is
requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) (after taking into account all other Certificates
surrendered by such holder pursuant to this Section 2.5(b)(i)), (C) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(i) and (D)
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1 shall automatically upon the Effective Time (or, at any later
time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, (A) cash in an amount equal
to the Per Share Cash Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless
a certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (after taking into account all other
Book-Entry Shares converted by such holder pursuant to this Section
2.5(b)(ii)), (C) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.5(c)(ii) and (D) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.3, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

 



7 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 2.3, until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(A) at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i), the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i), and a payment date subsequent
to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)(i), payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II, without interest, (A) at the
time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)(ii), the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii), and a payment date subsequent to the time of
such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii), payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock (other than the right to receive dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.5(c)). After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any former holder
of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of its claim
for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.5(c).

 



8 (f) None of Parent, Merger Corp, Merger LLC, the Company, the Surviving Entity
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares
of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.5(c) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered as provided in this Article II.

 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income
or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Common Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable
to Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other
income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events
be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in
commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article II. If for any reason (including
losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy
all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(i) Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any

 



9  provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any amount deducted or
withheld pursuant to this Section 2.5(i) shall be treated as having been paid
to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. In the case of any amounts withheld from any payments
not consisting entirely of cash, Parent shall be treated as though it withheld
an appropriate amount of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, sold such Parent Common
Stock for an amount of cash equal to its fair market value at the time of such
deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the holder of Company Common Stock
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Parent shall pay,
or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the
appropriate taxing authority within the period required under applicable Law.

 

Section 2.6 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Corp acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity shall be authorized to take all such actions
as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to
and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Entity or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 2.7 _Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Company 2007 Stock
Incentive Plan or the Company 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), other than those Performance Options as set forth in Section
2.7(b), that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall become vested
and exercisable in accordance with its terms, shall be assumed by Parent (the
" _Assumed Company Stock Options_ ") and shall be converted into a stock
option to acquire Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") in
accordance with this Section 2.7. Each such Parent Stock Option as so assumed
and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as applied to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but, taking into account any changes thereto provided for in
the Company Stock Plans, in any award agreement or in such Company Stock
Option by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby).
As of the Effective Time, each such Parent Stock Option as so assumed and
converted shall be for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
and (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by (y) the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to the Parent Stock Option shall be determined in
a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in
the case of Company Stock Options that are intended to qualify as
incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. For purposes of
this Agreement,

 



10  " _Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of the Exchange Ratio and the
Cash Portion Exchange Ratio. The " _Cash Portion Exchange Ratio_ " means the
quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Per Share Cash Amount by (2) an amount
equal to the average of the volume weighted average price per share of the
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent
and the Company) on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending with the
third complete trading day prior to the Closing Date, weighted by the total
volume of trading in Parent Common Stock on each such trading day.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Performance Option that is unvested and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and which does not
become vested as of the Effective Time in accordance with its terms) shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time with no consideration paid therefor.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans (a " _Company Restricted Share_ "), each restricted stock
unit granted under the Company Stock Plans (a " _Company RSU_ ") and each
performance-based stock unit granted under the Company Stock Plans (a "
_Company PSU_ "), other than those Performance Shares and Company PSUs
described in Section 2.7(d), that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (after taking into account any acceleration of vesting or lapse
of restrictions thereto provided for in the Company Stock Plans or in any
award agreement by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby), shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the
holder of such Company Restricted Share, Company RSU, or Company PSU shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to, and in accordance
with, Section 2.1 (and an amount in cash equal to any accumulated and unpaid
dividends thereon, consistent with the terms of an applicable award
agreement), in all cases subject to all applicable Tax withholdings.

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Performance Share that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (and which does not become
vested in accordance with its terms as of the Effective Time) shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time with no consideration paid therefor. Any
Company PSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and that does not become vested in accordance with its terms
as of the Effective Time) shall be cancelled without consideration at the
Effective Time, in accordance with its terms.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
to effect the adjustment, assumption or, if applicable, cancellation of the
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs or Company PSUs
under this Section 2.7. Parent shall reserve for future issuance a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that will be subject to Parent Stock Options as a result
of the actions contemplated by this Section 2.7. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement on an appropriate form (or a post-effective amendment to a
previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act) with respect
to the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Stock
Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Parent Stock Options remain outstanding.

Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto,

each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Effective Time. No reportable event
within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the thirty (30) days
notice requirement has not been waived has occurred. Neither the Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has, within the preceding six (6) years, withdrawn

qualified and the plan as currently in effect has received a favorable
determination letter or opinion to that effect from the Internal Revenue
Service and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination
letter should be revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to

Company Benefit Plan, (ii) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened Proceedings against any Company Benefit Plan, any
fiduciary thereof, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and (iii) all
contributions required to be made by the Company or any of its ERISA

applicable due dates. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries, any officer of the Company or of any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Company Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA,
including the Company Benefit Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any
trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or of any
Company Subsidiary to any Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed
by such Section 4975 of the Code or to any material liability under Section
502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA.

exists that would prevent the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates from

benefits in respect of any current or former employees of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries other than limitations imposed under the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement.

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated under this Agreement, or has not had and

benefits to any present or former employee, consultant or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) result in the entitlement of
any present or former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to severance or termination pay or benefits; or
(iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company to merge, amend or terminate
any of the Company Benefit Plans; or (iv) result in any payment under any of

forth in Section 3.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no
agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that, considered individually or
considered collectively with any other such agreements, plans, arrangements or
other Contracts, will, or could reasonably be expected to, give rise directly
or indirectly to the payment of any amount that would be characterized as a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. No
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is entitled to receive or will receive any gross-up or

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Parent
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing, if applicable, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which
the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Parent Subsidiaries is in violation of its Constituent Documents.

fair market value of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such stock
options.

(d) Except as set forth above and except for ordinary course equity grants
under the Parents equity plans made after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time, as of the Effective Time, there will not be any

redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of,
any Securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

(f) Parent is, directly or indirectly, the record and Beneficial Owner of all

Section 4.4 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability; State Takeover
Statutes_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Corp and Merger LLC has full corporate or limited
liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to the approval
by a majority of votes cast at the Parent Stockholder Meeting (such approval
relating to the Parent Stock Issuance, the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_
"), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
The execution and delivery by each of Parent, Merger Corp and Merger LLC of
this Agreement, the performance and compliance by Parent with each of
its obligations herein and the consummation by Parent, Merger Corp and Merger
LLC of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or limited liability company action 

 



33  on the part of Parent, Merger Corp and Merger LLC, subject, in the case of
the Parent Stock Issuance, to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval.
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Corp, will adopt this Agreement
immediately following its execution. Parent, as sole member of Merger LLC,
will adopt the Second Merger Agreement immediately following the execution
hereof. Each of Parent, Merger Corp and Merger LLC has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes
Parents and each Merger Subs legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as limited by
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, by general
equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before
which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought. For the three-year
period ending on the date immediately prior to the date hereof, neither Parent
nor either Merger Sub, nor any "affiliate" or "associate" of either of them,
has been an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as such terms are
defined in Article X of the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as in effect on the date hereof.

warranties of the Company in the last sentence of Section 3.3(a), such
resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby the restrictions of
Sections 3-601 through 3-605 of the MGCL, to the extent such restrictions
would be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. No other Takeover Laws apply or will apply to Parent
pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the

and (vi) such other Consents of, or Filings with, any Governmental Entity the
failure of which to obtain or make, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent nor the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance
by Parent with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with
or violate any provision of the Constituent Documents of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals
referred to in Section 4.5(a) and the Parent Stockholder Approval is duly
obtained in accordance with the MGCL, (x) violate any (1) Law or (2) Order,
in either case, applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of

registration statements, prospectuses and other documents (including exhibits
and other information incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished
by Parent with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since
January 1, 2013 (such documents, together with any documents filed
or furnished during such period by Parent to the SEC on a voluntary basis,
the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). No Parent Subsidiary is, or has at any time
since January 1, 2013 been, subject to the periodic reporting requirements of
the Exchange Act or is or has been otherwise required to file any form,
report, statement, schedule, certificate or other document with the SEC, any

(b) As of its respective date, or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of
the date of the last such amendment, each of the Parent SEC Documents
complied when filed or furnished (or, if applicable, when amended) in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in each case to the extent applicable to such
Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents when filed or
furnished (or in the case of a registration statement under the Securities
Act, at the time it was declared effective) contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of

 



35  the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (and no Parent
SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such
registration statement or amendment became effective, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading).

(c) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules thereto) and all
related compilations, reviews and other reports issued by Parents accountants
with respect thereto (the " _Parent SEC Financial Statements_ "), have been
derived from the accounting books and records of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries and (i) as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto and except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may
be permitted by Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X of the SEC) and (iii) fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and
the consolidated results of their operations, and, where included, their
consolidated stockholders equity and their consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments (which are not material in
significance or amount) and the absence of notes). No financial statements of
any Person other than Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are required by GAAP
to be included in the consolidated financial statements of Parent. Except as
required by GAAP and disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, between January 1,
2013 and the date of this Agreement, Parent has not made or adopted any
material change in its accounting methods, practices or policies.

(d) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(e) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any Parent SEC Documents and none

to the Knowledge of Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC review. There are no
internal investigations, any SEC inquiries or investigations or other
governmental inquiries or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of Parent.

 

(f) Since January 1, 2013, Parent has designed and maintained disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications

 



36  required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Parents management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Parents disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on Parents managements most recently completed evaluation
of Parents internal control over financial reporting, (i) Parent had
no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation
of its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) Parent does not have Knowledge of
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2013, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
executive officer or director of Parent has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of, and to the Knowledge of Parent, no auditor, accountant,
or representative of Parent has provided written notice to Parent or any
executive officer or director of, any substantive complaint or allegation that
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in improper accounting
practices. Since January 1, 2013, to the Knowledge of Parent, no attorney
representing Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries has reported to the
Parent Board or any committee thereof or to any current director or executive
officer of Parent evidence of a material violation of United States or other
securities Laws or breach of fiduciary duty by Parent or any of its executive
officers or directors.

(g) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued), except (i) those that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) as reflected or reserved against in the
most recent audited balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Financial
Statements or the notes thereto, (iii) for liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the most recent
audited balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Financial Statements and (iv)
for liabilities and obligations arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the Mergers. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is
a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement
(including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Parent and any of the Parent Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any material "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries in the Parent SEC Financial Statements or other Parent
SEC Documents.

 

Section 4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since June 29, 2013
through the date of this Agreement, (a) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
have conducted their businesses in all material respects only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice and (b) there has not
been any Parent Material Adverse Effect or any event, change, effect,
development, state of facts, condition, circumstance or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to

supplied by or on behalf of Parent or either Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
is filed with the SEC, and at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
(ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it or any amendment or
supplement is mailed to holders of the shares of Company Common Stock and
Parent Common Stock and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and at
the time of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading (except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent
or either Merger Sub regarding such portions thereof that relate expressly to
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or to statements made therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein). The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

Section 4.9 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date hereof, there are no
Proceedings pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, rights or
properties or any of the officers or directors of Parent, except, in each

not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties,
rights or assets is or are subject to any Order, except for those that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be

Permits necessary for the conduct of their business and the use of their
properties and assets, as presently conducted and used and each of the Permits
is valid, subsisting and in full force and effect, except where the failure to
have or maintain such Permit, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
The operation of the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as
currently conducted is not, and has not been since January 1, 2013, in
violation of, nor is Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in default or violation
under, any Permit, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred

violation of any terms, condition or provision of any Permit, except where
such default or violation of such Permit, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. There are no actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, that seek the revocation, cancellation or adverse modification of
any Permit, except where such revocation, cancellation or adverse
modification, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since January

claim or assertion, in each case alleging any violations of Permits, nor to
the Knowledge of Parent, has any such notice, charge, claim or assertion been
threatened, except where the receipt of such notice, charge, claim
or assertion, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not

Section 4.12 _ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments_.

 

(a) Section 4.12(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of each material Parent Benefit Plan. 

(b) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by Parent or any of
its ERISA Affiliates which has not been satisfied in full and no event has
occurred and no condition exists that could reasonably be likely to result in
Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates incurring liability under Title IV of
ERISA, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except
as set forth in Section 4.12(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, no Parent
Benefit Plan (i) is a defined benefit pension plan or is subject to Section
302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (each, a " _Parent Title
IV Plan_ ") or (ii) is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA or a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined
in Section 3(40) or ERISA.

(c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no Parent
Title IV Plan or

 



39  any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of
each Parent Title IV Plan ended prior to the Effective Time. No reportable
event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the thirty (30)
days notice requirement has not been waived has occurred. Neither Parent nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has, within the preceding six (6) years, withdrawn
in a complete or partial withdrawal from any multiemployer plan (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) or incurred any liability under Section 4204 of ERISA
that has not been satisfied in full.

(d) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
is so qualified and the plan as currently in effect has received a favorable
determination letter or opinion to that effect from the Internal Revenue
Service and Parent is not aware of any reason why any such determination
letter should be revoked or not be reissued. Parent has made available to
the Company copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
letter or opinion with respect to each such Parent Benefit Plan. Except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Parent Benefit
Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened Proceedings against any Parent Benefit Plan, any fiduciary thereof,
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, and (iii) all contributions required to
be made by Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates to any Parent Benefit Plan
have been made on or before their applicable due dates. To the Knowledge of
Parent, none of Parent, any of the Parent Subsidiaries, any officer of Parent
or of any Parent Subsidiary or any of the Parent Benefit Plans which are
subject to ERISA, including the Parent Benefit Plans, any trusts created
thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that
could subject Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or any officer of Parent or of
any Subsidiary of Parent to any Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by such Section 4975 of the Code or to any material liability under
Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA.

 

(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
there is no current or projected liability in respect of post-employment or
postretirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired,
former or current employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, except as required
to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code. No condition exists that
would prevent Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates from amending or
terminating any Parent Benefit Plan providing health or medical benefits in
respect of any current or former employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries other
than limitations imposed under the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement.

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated under this Agreement, or has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither the execution nor delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall,
whether alone or in combination with any other event (i) result in the
accelerated vesting or payment of, or any increase in, or the

 



40  funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, any compensation or
benefits to any present or former employee, consultant or director of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) result in the entitlement of any present or
former employee, consultant or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to severance or termination pay or benefits; (iii) limit or restrict the right

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and Parent and the Company, as
applicable, shall file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement to be sent to
the stockholders of Parent relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting and to
the stockholders of the Company relating to the Company Stockholders
Meeting and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to

 



53  have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments of the
SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall take all
action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities
Laws in connection with the Parent Stock Issuance. Each of Parent and the
Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the
other in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its respective stockholders. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by
Parent or the Company, in each case without providing the other Party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. Each Party shall notify the
other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the
issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the
Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. If the Company Board has not made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, through the Company
Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement, and (y) take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly permitted in
Section 5.4(b), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw or modify or qualify the Company Recommendation, (ii) take any other
action or make any other statement in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or (iii)
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any Takeover Proposal
((i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "). Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of
the Parties

 



54  hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal).

(c) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the
Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of
seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval. If the Parent Board has not made a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent shall, through the Parent Board,
make the Parent Recommendation, and shall include such Parent Recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Parent
Stock Issuance and (ii) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the Parent Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly permitted in Section
5.4(b), neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw or modify or qualify the Parent Recommendation, (ii) take any other
action or make any other statement in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or (iii)
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any Takeover Proposal
((i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "). Notwithstanding any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations
of the Parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such
obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to Parent of any Takeover Proposal (whether or not
a Superior Proposal).

(d) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting
on the same date and as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal and, if applicable, shall seek to have returned to the Company or
Parent any confidential information that has been provided in any such
discussions or negotiations. From and after the date hereof until the earlier
to occur of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII, each of the Company and Parent shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit
any of its officers, directors or employees or any Affiliate, investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information which has not been previously publicly disseminated), or take any
other action designed to facilitate, any inquiry or the making of any proposal
which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal, (ii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to
any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or
(iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, prior to obtaining the 

 



55  Company Stockholder Approval (in the case of the Company) or the Parent
Stockholder Approval (in the case of Parent), following the receipt of a
Superior Proposal or a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board or Parent
Board, as applicable, determines in good faith is reasonably expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and that in either case was unsolicited and made after
the date of this Agreement in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach
of this Agreement, and the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable,
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
a failure to take action with respect to such Takeover Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties (it being understood that, for all
purposes of this Agreement as it relates to Parent, references to fiduciary
duties shall include the duties of individual directors under the MGCL) to the
Companys stockholders or Parents stockholders, as applicable, under
applicable Law, the Company or Parent may, in response to such Takeover
Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 5.4(c), (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company or Parent, as applicable, to the
party making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
(an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") that contains provisions not
less favorable to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement need not include a comparable standstill provision
if the Company or Parent, as applicable, (x) waives the standstill provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement in favor of the other Party or (y) similarly
modifies the standstill provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement applicable
to the other Party, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such
party regarding such Takeover Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any officers, directors or
employees or any Affiliate, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other Representative of each of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.4(a) by the Company or Parent, as applicable.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board, may or, prior to receipt of Parent Stockholder
Approval, the Parent Board, may (in each case, subject to compliance with this
Section 5.4(b) and to compliance with Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(c)) effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable (each an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") if (and only if): (i) a written Takeover Proposal that was not
solicited in violation of this Agreement is made to the Company or Parent, as
applicable, by a third party and such Takeover Proposal is not withdrawn;
(ii) the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys or Parents, as applicable,
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company Board or the
Parent Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys or Parents, as applicable, outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable, under
applicable Laws; (iv) the board effecting the Adverse Recommendation Change
provides the other Party at least two (2) Business Days prior written notice
of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include the
information with respect to such Superior Proposal that is specified in
Section 5.4(c), as well as a copy of such Takeover Proposal; (v) during the
four (4) Business Days following such written notice (or such shorter period
as is specified below), the board effecting the Adverse Recommendation Change
and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith with the other

 



56  party regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated
hereby proposed by the other party in response to such Superior Proposal; and
(vi) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period described in the
foregoing clause (v), the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable,
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys and Parents,
as applicable, (x) outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking
into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by the other party), that the Takeover Proposal continues
to be a Superior Proposal and (y) outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the exercise by the Company
Board or Parent Board of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company or Parent under applicable Law. Any material amendment or
modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new Takeover
Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.4; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
notice period and the period during which the Company Board or Parent Board
(as applicable) effecting the Adverse Recommendation Change and its
Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith with the other Party
regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other
Party in response to such new Takeover Proposal pursuant to clause (v) above
shall expire on the later to occur of (x) two (2) Business Days after the
board effecting the applicable Adverse Recommendation Change provides written
notice of such new Takeover Proposal to the other Party and (y) the end of the
original four (4) Business Day period described in clause (v) above. Nothing
in this Section 5.4(b) shall permit any Party or its board to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other
agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any Takeover Proposal or
Superior Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).
Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, the
Company Board and/or Parent Board shall submit this Agreement (and, in the
case of the Parent Board, the Parent Stock Issuance) to its stockholders even
if the Company Board or Parent Board shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change, and the Company Board or Parent Board may not submit to
the vote of their stockholders any Takeover Proposal other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company and Parent set forth in
Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), the Company or Parent shall promptly, and in any
event no later than 24-hours after it receives any Takeover Proposal, advise
the other Party orally and in writing of any request for confidential
information in connection with a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Takeover
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such request or Takeover
Proposal and shall keep the other Party promptly advised of all changes to the
material terms of any Takeover Proposal. Each of the Company and Parent,
shall, prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to any third
Persons, provide to the other Party any non-public information concerning the
Company or Parent and their Subsidiaries that the Company or Parent provides
(including through its Representatives) to any third Person in connection with
any Takeover Proposal that was not previously provided to the other Party.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 or Section 5.5, but in all cases
subject to Section 5.3(b) or Section 5.3(c), as applicable, shall prohibit
the Company Board or the Parent Board from (i) taking and disclosing to their
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by 

 



57  Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to their stockholders if the Company Board
or Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys or Parents, as applicable, outside counsel, that the failure to
make such disclosure would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Parent Board, the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted
by Section 5.4(b), effect an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person (other than the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates) relating to (A) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of

securities of the Company or Parent, (B) any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more
of any class of equity securities of the Company or Parent and (C) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving the Company or
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to which such Person

Company or Parent, as applicable, or 50% or more of any class of equity
securities or voting power of the Company or Parent, any tender offer or

owning 50% or more of any class of equity securities or voting power of
the Company or Parent, or any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries pursuant to which
such Person (or its stockholders) would own 50% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company or Parent or 50% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or Parent or of any resulting parent company of the
Company or Parent (in each case other than the transactions contemplated by

reasonable period of time on the terms set forth in such proposal, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects thereof that the
Company Board or Parent Board deems relevant, (B) for which the third party

reasonably likely to be obtained, in each case as determined by the Company
Board or the Parent Board in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
the Companys or Parents, as applicable, financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) and (C) which the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, has
determined in its good faith judgment would, if consummated, result in a

Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Joint

party or is subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client
privilege) which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to

in any material respect such Partys position in any pending or reasonably
probable future litigation; _provided_ , that the Parties shall cooperate in

Representatives of the non-disclosing Party shall be provided access to such
information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the disclosing Party shall (x)

material Contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to
be undermined and (y) in the case where such disclosures are reasonably
likely to violate such disclosing Partys or its Subsidiaries obligations
under any material Contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent
from the applicable third party to any such material Contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such Contract).

accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality 

 



60  Agreement, except that (x) notwithstanding Section 2 of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company and Parent may disclose any of the terms, conditions or
other facts of the Mergers and transactions contemplated by this Agreement if
expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement; (y) notwithstanding
Section 1 of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall have no further
consent rights with respect to Parents selection of any potential source of
debt financing (and their respective representatives) or Parents ability to
share Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
with such debt financing sources (provided, that Parent shall provide prompt
written notice to the Company of any such debt financing sources with whom it
has shared Confidential Information) and (z) any such debt financing sources
shall be expressly included within the definition of "Representatives" in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Party agrees
that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, prior to the
Effective Time, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.7 for
any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the Mergers.

Section 5.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Mergers and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Mergers, as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with
the other Party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of,
or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third Person which
is required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of any such
consent, authorization, order or approval. To the extent necessary in order to
accomplish the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth in Section
5.8(e), Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to jointly propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by
Parent and the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of, any portion
of the business, properties or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the
Company shall be required to propose, commit to or effect any action (x) that
is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (y) that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have, or would reasonably be expected
to have (after giving effect to any reasonably expected proceeds of any
divestiture or sale of assets) a material and adverse effect on the business
of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(individually or in the aggregate, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate 

 



61  and make effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts
to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and using reasonable best efforts to defend any litigation
seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeking material damages.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each Party
hereto shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten Business Days of the
date hereof, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this
Section 5.8 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon
as practicable and (ii) each of the Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonable to enable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize
the effect of such Law on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of the Parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any governmental
inquiry, investigation or proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii)
keep the other Party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably
timely basis of any communication received by such Party from, or given by
such Party to, the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or
any other Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given by a
private Person in connection with any governmental inquiry, investigation or
proceeding, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with
any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder. In
addition, Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition
clearances and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with
any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust
or competition clearances. In furtherance and not in limitation of this
Section 5.8(d), subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each Party shall consult and cooperate with the other Party in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
legal proceeding, each Party hereto shall permit authorized

 



62  Representatives of the other Party (x) to participate at or in each
substantive meeting, conference or telephone call with a representative of a
Governmental Entity relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or other legal proceeding and (y) to have reasonable access to and be
consulted in connection with any material document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding. Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
5.8(d) as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.8(d), materials
provided to the other Party or its outside counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation, pricing and other competitively sensitive
terms from an antitrust perspective in the Contracts of Parent, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.8(a), 5.8(b), 5.8(c) and 5.8(d) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or its
Subsidiaries be required to agree to, nor shall the Company take or permit any
Company Subsidiary to take (unless in each case Parent directs the Company to
do so), any action that would result in a Burdensome Condition.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Constituent Documents or
any indemnification or similar agreements shall survive the Mergers and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to comply therewith. For a period of no less
than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity to maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses provisions of the Companys Constituent Documents or any
indemnification or similar agreements, in the form that is in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company; _provided_
, _however_ , that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding. Section 5.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and correct list of all indemnification or similar arrangements in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries that have been entered into within the 30 days preceding
the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the

 



63  continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, cause proper
provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time the Company may, and if the Company does not,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of immediately following the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from insurance
carriers with the same or better credit ratings as the Companys current
insurance carriers with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "
_D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing
DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Companys existing
DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company pay, or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, be
required to pay, for such "tail" insurance policies a one-time premium in
excess of 300% of the Companys current annual premium for DandO Insurance (the
" _Premium Cap_ "). If the Company and the Surviving Entity for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, DandO
Insurance for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with
terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in such existing DandO Insurance, from insurance carriers with the same
or better claims-paying ability ratings as the Companys current DandO Insurance
carriers;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Entity shall not be
required to pay for such DandO Insurance an annual premium in excess of Premium
Cap, in which case the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in
effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six years
from the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Companys
existing DandO Insurance, DandO Insurance with the best overall terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage reasonably available for an
annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive consummation of the
Mergers, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Party entitled to indemnification hereunder, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract or otherwise.

Section 5.10 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. The Company shall take all
necessary action to, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
terminate (a) that certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated April 3, 2013,
among the Company and the other parties thereto, (b) that certain Stockholders
Agreement, dated April 3, 2013, among the Company and the other parties
thereto and (c) all other agreements between Company or the Company
Subsidiaries and any Blackstone Entities (and any of their Affiliates),
without any liability or obligation.

 



64 Section 5.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts (taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letter and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the
Company, if such amendment or modification (i) reduces the aggregate amount of
the Financing to an amount below the amount required, to consummate the
Mergers and to repay or refinance the debt contemplated to be replaced by the
Commitment Letter, including the payment of all fees, premiums and expenses
associated therewith, including the redemption of the Notes and satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture pursuant to Section 5.12, (ii) imposes
additional conditions or any contingencies or otherwise expands upon any of
the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to make any portion of the funding of the Financing
less likely to be obtained, (iii) prevents, impedes or delays the occurrence
of Closing, (iv) adversely impacts the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against any other party to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements
or (v) adversely impacts the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to the foregoing,
Parent may amend, supplement, modify or replace the Commitment Letter as
in effect at the date hereof (x) to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement or (y) to increase the
amount of indebtedness. For purposes of this Agreement, (1) the term "
_Financing_ " shall be deemed to include the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter as amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this Section
5.11 (including any Alternative Financing and any proceeds of any Senior
Notes used to satisfy the obligations under this Agreement), and (2) the term
" _Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter as
may be amended or modified pursuant to this Section 5.11 and any commitment
letters with respect to the Alternative Financing. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing or any Alternative
Financing is a condition to Parents obligations to consummate the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter pursuant to its terms (except for
amendments not prohibited by Section 5.11(a)) until the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained
in the Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions) or on other terms
not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms and conditions contained in
the Commitment Letter (such definitive agreements, the " _Definitive
Agreements_ "), and do not expand upon the conditions

 



65  precedent set forth in the Commitment Letter in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to make any portion of the funding of the Financing
less likely to be obtained or prevent, impede or delay the funding of the
Financing and, upon execution thereof, deliver a copy thereof to the Company,
(iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek a waiver on a timely
basis of) all conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter that are
required to be satisfied by it and, in the event that all conditions to
funding in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements are satisfied
at or prior to Closing, consummate the Financing at the Closing in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter as in effect at or
prior to the Closing and (iv) so long as the conditions in the immediately
preceding clause (iii) have been satisfied, enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements in the event of a failure to
fund by the Financing Sources that prevents, impedes or delays the Closing,
including if Parent believes in good faith that all of the conditions
precedent to the Financing Sources obligation to fund the loans under the
Commitment Letter have been met, by seeking specific performance of the
funding obligations of the parties thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 5.11(b)
shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or
either Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or either
Merger Sub to pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the
Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter.

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or Parent becomes aware
of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing
unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") and all references to Financing
shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing and all references to
the Commitment Letter and Definitive Documents shall include the applicable
documents for the Alternative Financing; provided however, that Parent shall
not be required to obtain financing which includes terms and conditions less
favorable (taking into account any "market flex" provision), in the
aggregate, to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent), in
each case relative to those in the Financing being replaced. Parent shall give
the Company prompt oral and written notice of any material breach or default
by any party to the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements of which Parent
becomes aware or any termination or waiver, amendment or other modification of
the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its effort to arrange the Financing and
shall provide to the Company copies of all material, final definitive
documents related to the Financing (excluding fee letters, except to the
extent that such documents contain any conditions to funding or other
substantive provisions regarding the terms and conditions of the Financing).
In the event that Parent commences an enforcement action to enforce its rights
under the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements and/or cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Financing, Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of such enforcement action.

 

(d) The Company shall, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to
provide, on a timely basis, all reasonable cooperation requested by Parent
and/or the Financing Sources that is reasonably necessary and customary to
assist Parent in connection with Parent obtaining the Financing (including,
for the avoidance of doubt the Senior Notes), provided that such requested

 



66  cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, such cooperation shall in any event include (i) promptly
providing Parent and the Financing Sources and their respective agents with
(A) all historical financial information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources in order
to consummate the Financing, including the historical financial statements
required to be delivered pursuant to Section 3 of Exhibit C of the Commitment
Letter and the information necessary for the Parent to prepare pro forma
financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 4 of Exhibit
C of the Commitment Letter (in each case as in effect on the date hereof, or
any similar provisions pursuant to any permitted amendments to the
Commitment Letter pursuant to Section 5.11(a) or pursuant to any Alternative
Financing), all information required to be delivered pursuant to this clause
(i)(A) being referred to as the " _Required Information_ ") and (B)
using reasonable best efforts to promptly provide Parent and the Financing
Sources and their respective agents with such other information regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
the Financing Sources or their respective agents to prepare customary bank
information memoranda, lender presentations, offering memoranda and private
placement memoranda (including under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and
subject to customary exceptions for offerings under Rule 144A and private
placements) including such other information and data as are otherwise
reasonably necessary in order to receive customary "comfort" letters with
respect to the financial statements and data referred to in clause (A), and
other materials in connection with a syndicated bank financing or other debt
offering in connection with such Financing (including information reasonably
requested by such Persons so as to permit Parent to prepare the "Projections"
contemplated by the Commitment Letter); (ii) participating (including by
making members of senior management, certain representatives and certain non-
legal advisors, in each case with appropriate seniority and
expertise, available to participate) in a reasonable number of meetings
(including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead
arrangers or agent for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the
Financing and senior management and Representatives, in each case with
appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), due diligence sessions, presentations, "road shows", drafting
sessions and sessions with the rating agencies in connection with the
Financing, in each case upon reasonable advance notice and at mutually agreed
times; (iii) reasonably cooperating with the Financing Sources and their
respective agents due diligence, including providing access to documentation
reasonably requested by such Persons in connection with lending or capital
markets transactions; (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts
for any portion of the Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that any syndication effort benefits materially from any existing
lending and investment banking relationship; (v) aiding in the preparation of
documentation, including bank information memoranda and private
placement memoranda (including under Rule 144A under the Securities Act)
(including, in the case of bank information memoranda and private placement
memoranda, the delivery of customary authorization and representation letters
to the extent contemplated by the Financing), rating agency presentations,
road show presentations and written offering materials and similar documents
used to complete such Financing, in each case, to the extent information
contained therein relates to the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and is customarily included in such documents; it being
understood that such information shall not include information that is
customarily provided by the Parent or the Financing Sources; (vi) cause
its certified independent auditors to provide

 



67  (A)(x) consent to use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Financing, including offering memoranda that include or incorporate the
Companys consolidated financial information and their reports thereon and
(y) auditors reports and customary comfort letters with respect to financial
information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in customary
form and (B) other customary documentation and assistance (including
reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma financial statements by
Parent) (for the avoidance of doubt, the auditors will provide such documents
and assistance in advance of the Effective Time in connection with any part
of the Financing provided by the Senior Notes); (vii) providing (including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain such documents from its advisors)
customary certificates, legal opinions or other customary closing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources (including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters in the form set forth on Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter
as of the Closing on a pro forma basis and consents and officers and public
officials certifications); (viii) entering into one or more credit or other
agreements on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Financing;
(ix) taking all actions reasonably necessary in connection with the payoff of
existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
and the release of related Liens on the Closing Date (including obtaining
customary payoff letters, lien terminations and other instruments of
discharge); provided, solely in the case of clauses (vii), (viii), (ix), (x)
and (xi), that there shall be no obligation of the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees to execute,
deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument (other
than the authorization and representation letters contemplated by the
Commitment Letter and as otherwise contemplated by Section 5.12), including
any Definitive Agreement, with respect to the Financing that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time; (x)
causing the taking of corporate actions reasonably necessary to permit
the completion of the Financing; (xi) executing and delivering any pledge and
security documents (and any other documents or instruments required for the
creation and perfection of security interests in the collateral securing the
Financing) or other definitive financing documents reasonably requested by
Parent or the Financing Sources (including guarantees and other deliverables);
(xii) providing, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to
the Financing Sources all documentation and other information reasonably
requested by such Financing Sources at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date that such Financing Sources reasonably determine is required
by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act; (xiii)
cooperating in the procuring of corporate and facilities ratings for the
Financing by Parent, in each case, from each of Standard and Poors Ratings
Services and Moodys Investors Service, Inc.; (xiv) informing Parent if the
Companys board of directors, a committee of the board of directors, or any
executive officer, including the chief financial officer, of the Company
concludes that any previously issued financial statements included in the
Required Information should no longer be relied upon; and (xv) updating any
Required Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such
Required Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such
Required Information qualifies as a Compliant Document. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall (1) be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or pay any expenses prior
to the Effective Time that are not promptly reimbursed by Parent as set forth
in this Section 5.11(d) or (2) have any liability or any obligation under any
credit agreement or any related document or

 



68  any other agreement or document relating to the Financing or any Alternative
Financing (other than the authorization and representation letters
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and as otherwise contemplated by
Section 5.12), in each case, other than as set forth in this Agreement
(exclusive of this Section 5.11(d)).

 

(e) Parent shall promptly (A) upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out of pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries and their Representatives contemplated by
this Section 5.11 and (B) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties (collectively, the " _Liabilities_ ")
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any claims asserted by
Financing Sources in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (other
than to the extent such Liabilities arise from the willful misconduct of or
breach of this Agreement by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives) and any information used in connection
therewith. All non-public or other confidential information provided by the
Company to Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to rating
agencies and prospective lenders during syndication of the debt financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, subject to ordinary and customary
confidentiality undertakings. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable
use of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with
the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 5.12 _Redemption of Company Bonds_. Promptly after receipt of any
written request by Parent to do so, the Company shall (i) prepare a notice of

respect to the Notes, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Trustee (as defined in the Indenture) to agree to proceed with the redemption
of such Notes, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture
with respect to the Notes, which redemption will be subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of all
conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Article VI of

under the Indenture to redeem such Notes and satisfy and discharge and/or
defease substantially all of the covenants contained in the Indenture

sufficient to pay in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of,
accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date on and applicable
premium related to such Notes in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the Indenture with respect to the Notes, as arranged by Parent) immediately
prior to the consummation of the Merger.

 



69 Section 5.13 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than employees whose terms and conditions of employment
are governed by a collective bargaining agreement) who remains in the active
employment of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive an annual rate of salary or wages and
annual incentive opportunities, and employee benefits (other than equity-based
awards) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the annual rate of
salary or wages and annual incentive opportunities, and employee benefits
(other than equity-based awards) provided by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) For a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on the first

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company Benefit
Plans, compensation, retention and severance arrangements and agreements, and
collective bargaining agreements, in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time. Subject to Section 409A of the Code,
Parent and the Company hereby agree that a "change of control" or "change in
control" within the meaning of each Company Benefit Plan (or an event of
similar effect under the terms of such Company Benefit Plan) will occur upon
the Closing.

(d) [Reserved].

 

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and any of its Subsidiaries third party insurance
providers or third party administrators to waive all limitations as to any
pre-existing condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Continuing Employee under any welfare plans that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and
that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any comparable
employee benefit plan. In addition, as of the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Entity and any applicable Company Subsidiary to,
give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting
(but, not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan)
under any employee benefit and compensation plans or arrangements maintained
by Parent or an applicable Parent Subsidiary that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time for such Continuing
Employees service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to the same
extent that such service was credited for purposes of any comparable employee
benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and in no event shall
service prior to the Effective Time be required to be taken into account if
such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period.

 



70 (f) No provision of this Section 5.13 shall be construed as a limitation on
the right of Parent, or to cause any Parent Subsidiary to, amend or terminate
any specific employee benefit plan that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary would
otherwise have under the terms of such employee benefit plan, nor shall any
provision of this Section 5.13 be construed to require the continuation of
the employment of any particular Continuing Employee. The provisions of this
Section 5.13 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor or
any other Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.13 of
this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
employee benefit plan of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other
compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

Section 5.14 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.16 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought against the Company and/or its directors by
security holders of the Company, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of
such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement,
in, but not control, the defense and settlement of any such litigation against
the Company and/or its directors by security holders of the Company and no
such settlement shall be agreed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
without Parents prior written consent.

 

Section 5.17 _Parent Board_. Parent shall take all actions necessary so that,
as and to the extent contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement, the Initial
Designee (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) shall be appointed to the
Parent Board effective as of the first day following the day on which the
Effective Time occurs.

 

Section 5.18 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Parent, Merger Corp, Merger LLC and the Company shall (A) use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Mergers, taken together, to constitute a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code, and (B) neither take any action nor fail to
take any action if such action or such failure could reasonably be expected
to prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying

 



71  as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Parent, Merger Corp, Merger LLC and the Company shall execute and deliver
officers certificates containing appropriate representations at such time or
times as may be reasonably requested by counsel, including in connection with
any filing of the Form S-4 and the delivery of the 368 Opinion, for purposes
of rendering opinions with respect to the tax treatment of the Mergers.

(b) Parent shall immediately notify the Company if, at any time before the
Effective Time, Parent becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 

(c) The Company shall immediately notify Parent if, at any time before the
Effective Time, the Company becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together,
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

(d) If the Company receives from Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, counsel to
the Company, a written opinion on or prior to the Closing Date to the effect
that for U.S. Federal income tax purposes the Mergers will constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _368
Opinion_ ") and such opinion is delivered to Parent, then Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and Merger LLC to effect the Second Merger
immediately after the consummation of the Merger. In rendering the 368
Opinion, counsel to the Company shall be entitled to rely upon
customary assumptions and representations reasonably satisfactory to such
counsel, including representations set forth in certificates of officers of
Parent, Merger Corp, Merger LLC and the Company.

 

Section 5.19 _Coordination of Dividends_. From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall coordinate with each
other regarding the timing of declaration and payment of cash dividends in
respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto in accordance with
the Section 5.19 of Company Disclosure Letter, subject to the approval of the
board of directors of Parent and the Company with respect to its dividends.

confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any
Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, except, that notwithstanding the foregoing clause (b), (i) following
the Effective Time, the provisions of Section 5.9 shall be enforceable by each
Party entitled to indemnification hereunder and his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) the provisions of Section 8.1, this Section 8.6,

this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not

this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall
include the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Company Disclosure Letter. The

benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors

personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and

Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such
court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in

for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).
The Parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of Section 8.13
relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third party-claim referenced in this Section 8.12(b).

Representatives in connection with or related to this Agreement, the Financing
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including for any
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including
any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious
nature. For avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall this Section 8.12(c)
apply to Parent, whether before or after the Closing, and (ii) from and after
the Closing, the foregoing shall not modify or alter in any respect any
provision of any definitive loan documentation between or among Parent, the
Company (or the Surviving Entity), and any of their Subsidiaries and any
Financing Source entered into in connection with or as contemplated by this
Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between the foregoing and any
provision in any such definitive loan documentation, the provisions of
such definitive loan documentation shall govern and control.

Section 8.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED

Security, a Person shall be deemed to be the Beneficial Owner of any
Securities which may be acquired by such Person pursuant to any contract,
arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights,
exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise (irrespective of whether
the right to acquire such Securities is exercisable immediately or only after
the passage of time, including the passage of time in excess of 60 days,
the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of any event or any
combination of the foregoing). The terms " _Beneficially Own_ ," "

Stockholder to any Affiliate of such Stockholder if the transferee of such
Covered Company Shares evidences in a writing reasonably satisfactory to
Parent such transferees agreement to be bound by and subject to the terms

upon such transfer to be deemed a Stockholder hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, each of the Stockholders may from
time to time transfer among and between themselves any of the Covered Company
Shares and each such transfer shall be deemed a Permitted Transfer (it being
understood that any Covered Company Shares so transferred shall continue to
constitute Covered Company Shares under this Agreement).

" _Transfer_ " means any direct or indirect offer, sale, lease, assignment,
encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition or other transfer (by
operation of law or otherwise) or entry into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to any offer, sale, lease,
assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition or other transfer
(by operation of law or otherwise), of any capital stock or interest
(including voting interest) in any capital stock (it being understood that no
Transfer shall be deemed to be made by Stockholder solely as a result
of transfers of limited partnership interests in such Stockholder).

Agreement, the Merger Agreement, together with the several agreements and

Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

Section 6.9  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected
in a manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon any such
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree
upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible and to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be fulfilled to the maximum extent
possible.

 

Section 6.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written

otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested
in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware
without proof of actual damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party
agrees not to oppose the granting of such relief in the event a court
determines that such a breach has occurred, and to waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. In
addition, each of the Parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead
or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any
judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement
in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if
under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
any federal court located in the State of Delaware and (d) consents to service
of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 6.6.

Section 6.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT.

 



14 Section 6.15 _Capacity as a Stockholder_. The Stockholders make their
agreements and understandings herein solely in their capacities as record
holders and Beneficial Owners of the Covered Company Shares and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall limit or
affect any actions taken by a Representative of any Stockholder solely in his
capacity as a director or officer of the Company.

Section 6.16 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as parties hereto (and in the case of the Stockholders, each of their general
partners) and no former, current or future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of any
party hereto or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse
Party_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the
parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party
against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its
Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach
of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-
Recourse Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.16 shall in no
way be deemed to limit (a) the liability or obligations of any Party to the
extent that such Party is required to cause it Subsidiaries or controlled
Affiliates, or to use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, to
take any action or refrain from taking any action pursuant to this Agreement
or (b) any remedy or rights available to Parent under the Merger Agreement.

   2. | SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT; DEMAND REGISTRATION. 
---|--- 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including the
limitations set forth in Section 2(b), Section 2(c) and Section 7):

 

(i) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file
with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor
form) providing for continuous resales of securities pursuant to Rule 415 of
the Securities Act (a " _Shelf_

 



3   _Registration Statement_ ") with respect to sales of Registrable Securities
which may be made by the Holders, and to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Rights
Effective Date. Upon the demand of Holders pursuant to a notice made at any
time and from time to time beginning ten (10) days prior to the Rights
Effective Date, the Company will facilitate, beginning on the Rights
Effective Date, in the manner described in this Section 2(a)(i), a "takedown"
of shares of Common Stock off of such Shelf Registration Statement (a " _Shelf
Takedown_ "), including, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
2(a)(v), an Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Company is a WKSI, the Company shall file, on or prior to the Rights Effective
Date, the Shelf Registration Statement in the form of an automatic
shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
Act) or any successor form thereto registering all Registrable Securities then
held by such Holders. Within ten (10) days after the Shelf Registration
Statement is declared effective, the Company will deliver written notice
thereof to all other Holders. Each Holder may elect to participate with
respect to its Registrable Securities in the Shelf Registration Statement in
accordance with the plan and method of distribution set forth, or to be set
forth, in such Shelf Registration Statement by delivering to the Company a
written request to so participate within ten (10) days after the Company
notifies each Holder in writing of the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement. Subject to Section 2(c), the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective (including by filing a new Shelf Registration Statement
on or prior to the date any prior Shelf Registration Statement would become
unusable under the Securities Act) until the earlier of (i) two (2) years
after the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective; (ii) the
date on which all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement have been sold thereunder in accordance with the plan and method of
distribution disclosed in the prospectus included in the Shelf Registration
Statement, or otherwise cease to be Registrable Securities; and (iii) the
date on which this agreement terminates pursuant to Section 23\.

(ii) Following the Rights Effective Date, at any time that a Shelf
Registration Statement is effective, if any Holder delivers a notice to the
Company (a " _Take-Down Notice_ ") stating that it intends to sell all or part
of its Registrable Securities included by it on the Shelf Registration
Statement in an Underwritten Offering (a " _Shelf Offering_ "), then, the
Company shall promptly amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement as
may be necessary in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be
distributed pursuant to the Shelf Offering.

(iii) At any time after the Rights Effective Date, Holders may request by
written notice delivered to the Company (a " _Demand Notice_ ") that the
Company register under the Securities Act all or any portion (subject to
Section 2(a)(v)) of the Registrable Securities then held by Holders, for sale
in the manner specified in such Demand Notice (including, but not limited to,
an Underwritten Offering) (a " _Demand Registration_ "). In each such case,
the Demand Notice shall specify the number of Registrable Securities for
which registration is requested and the proposed manner of disposition of such
securities.

(iv) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with
the SEC within twenty (20) days after the Companys receipt of a Demand Notice
a registration statement for the public offering and sale, in accordance with
the method of disposition specified by Holders in such Demand Notice, of the
number of Registrable Securities specified in such notice, and thereafter use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement 

 



4  to become effective within forty-five (45) days after its filing. Such
registration statement may be on Form S-3 or another appropriate form that the
Company is eligible to use and that is reasonably acceptable to the managing
underwriter, if any. A Demand Registration shall not be deemed to have been
effected and shall not count as a Demand Registration (i) unless a
registration statement with respect thereto has become effective and has
remained effective for a period of at least ninety (90) days or such shorter
period in which all Registrable Securities included in such Demand
Registration have actually been sold thereunder (provided, that such period
shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the holder of
Registrable Securities refrains from selling any securities included in such
registration statement at the request of the Company or the lead managing
underwriter(s) pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement) or (ii) if,
after it has become effective, such Demand Registration becomes subject, prior
to ninety (90) days after effectiveness, to any stop order, injunction or
other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental authority, other
than by reason of any act or omission by the applicable Selling Stockholders.
Demand Registrations shall be on such appropriate registration form of the
Commission as shall be selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to
the requesting Holders.

(v) The Company shall not have any obligation hereunder to register
any Registrable Securities under Section 2(a)(ii) for a Demand Registration
or an underwritten Shelf Offering unless it shall have received a request from
Holders to register at least the lesser of (x) twenty-five percent (25%) of
the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities held by all of the Holders and
(y) Registrable Securities having a market value of no less than $150 million,
in each case as of the date of such request.

 

(vi) If the Company is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
register Registrable Securities in a registration initiated upon the demand
of Holders pursuant to Section 2(a)(ii) of this Agreement and the managing
underwriters for such offering advise that the inclusion of all securities
sought to be registered pursuant to Section 2 hereof may interfere with an
orderly sale and distribution of or may adversely affect the success or price
of such offering, then the Company will include in such offering, _first_ ,
the aggregate number of Registrable Securities requested to be included by
Holders pursuant to the Demand Notice, _second_ , the shares of Common Stock
of third party stockholders that are entitled to registration rights under
Other Registration Rights Agreements (" _Third Party Securities_ "), allocated
pro rata among the Third Party Securities as the Company and such third party
stockholders may agree or as may be provided in the Other Registration Rights
Agreement, and _third_ , all other securities requested or proposed to be
included in such registration statement (including shares of Common Stock to
be sold for the account of the Company).

(b) The obligations of the Company to effect, or to take any action to
effect, a Demand Registration or an underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be
limited as follows:

(i) Between the Closing Date and the Rights Effective Date, Holders do not
have the right to require the Company to effect any Demand Registrations or
underwritten Shelf Takedowns;

 

(ii) From the period commencing on the Rights Effective Date through the
Termination of this Agreement, Holders may require the Company to effect two
(2) Demand

 



5  Registrations or underwritten Shelf Takedowns in any 365-day period;
provided, that Holders may not require the Company to effect any such offering
prior to ninety (90) days following a previous Demand Registration or
underwritten Shelf Takedown;

(iii) If a Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown shall have taken the form of
a "bought deal" or a "block trade", in either case representing five percent
(5%) or more of the outstanding Common Stock at such time (a " _Block Sale_
"), no Holder shall be permitted in any event to sell additional Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Shelf Takedown for ninety (90) days following such
Block Sale; and

(iv) In no event shall the Company be required to include a Holders
Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration or underwritten Shelf Takedown
if such Holder included in any registration under Section 3 and declared
effective within sixty (60) calendar days preceding the related Demand Notice
at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Registrable Securities such Holder
sought to be included in such registration under Section 3\.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event of a
Blackout Period the Company shall have the right to defer or suspend the
filing or effectiveness of a registration statement relating to any
registration requested under Section 2(a)(i) (1) until the expiration of the
applicable Blackout Period and (2) for a reasonable period of time not to
exceed sixty (60) days if a prior registration statement of the Company for an
underwritten public offering by the Company of its securities was declared
effective by the SEC less than ninety (90) days prior to the anticipated
effective date of the requested registration. In the event of an Information
Blackout under clause (1) of the definition thereof, the Company shall deliver
to the Holders requesting registration a certificate signed by either the
chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company
certifying that, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the
Company, the conditions described in clause (1) of the definition of
Information Blackout are met. Such certificate shall contain an approximation
of the anticipated delay.

(d) Any Demand Notice may be revoked by notice from the Holder to the Company
prior to the effective date of the corresponding registration statement;
_provided_ , that such revoked Demand Notice will count for purposes of
Section 2(b) unless the Company is promptly reimbursed for all out-of-pocket
expenses (including fees of outside counsel and accountants and other
Registration Expenses) incurred by the Company relating to the registration
requested pursuant to such revoked Demand Notice. A Demand Notice may not be
made for a minimum of ninety (90) calendar days after the revocation of an
earlier Demand Notice.

(e) Any time that a Demand Registration involves an Underwritten Offering,
the Company (in consultation with the Holders) shall select the investment
banker(s) and manager(s) that will serve as managing underwriters (including
which such managing underwriters will serve as lead or co-lead) and
underwriters with respect to the offering of such Registrable Securities;
_provided_ , that such investment banker(s) and manager(s) shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Holders (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



6 ---|--- 
 

(a) At any time after the Rights Effective Date until two (2) years following
the Rights Effective Date, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, if the
Company proposes to register any equity securities of the Company (whether
proposed to be offered for sale by the Company or by any other Person (other
than the Holders)) (collectively, " _Other Securities_ ") for public sale
under the Securities Act (other than a registration by the Company (i) on Form
S-4 or any successor form thereto, (ii) on Form S-8 or any successor form
thereto, (iii) pursuant to Section 2 or (iv) on a form or in a manner which
would not permit registration of Registrable Securities for sale to the public
under the Securities Act), it will give prompt written notice (which notice
shall specify the intended method or methods of disposition) to Holders of
its intention to do so (such notice, an " _Incidental Notice_ "), and upon the
written request of Holders delivered to the Company within ten (10) Business
Days after the giving of any such notice (which request shall specify the
number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by Holders) the
Company will, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect, in connection with the registration of the Other
Securities, the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable
Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Holders
(a " _Piggyback Registration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that:

 

(i) any Holder who has included Registrable Securities in a registration under
Section 2 that was declared effective within the ninety (90) calendar days
immediately preceding the receipt of such Incidental Notice shall not be
permitted to request the inclusion of any Registrable Securities in such
Piggyback Registration;

 

(ii) if, at any time after giving an Incidental Notice and prior to the
effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such
registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to register such
Other Securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of
such determination to Holders within five (5) Business Days thereof and
thereupon the Company shall be relieved of its obligation to register such
Registrable Securities in connection with the registration of such Other
Securities, without prejudice, however, to the rights (to the extent
applicable and subject to the terms and conditions hereof) of Holders to
request that such registration be effected as a registration under Section 2;

(iii) in connection with any Underwritten Offering, the Company will not be
required to effect any registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this
Section 3 if the Company shall have been advised by the managing underwriter
for the offering selected by the Company that, in such firms opinion, a
registration of Registrable Securities and Other Securities sought to be
included in such Piggyback Registration may interfere with an orderly sale and
distribution of the securities being sold in such offering or would adversely
affect the success thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if an offering of
some but not all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by
the Holders and Other Securities sought to be included in such registration
(other than pursuant to so-called "piggyback" or other incidental or
participation registration rights) would not have such adverse effect in the
opinion of such firm, then the Company will include in such offering: _first_
, the Other Securities to be registered for the Companys account, _second_ ,
the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the Holders pursuant
to Section 3, as well as all other Third Party Securities requested to be
registered by third party stockholders under Other Registration Rights
Agreements, allocated pro rata among the Registrable Securities and Third
Party Securities based on the number of Registrable Securities and Third
Party Securities proposed to be registered in such registration by the
Holders and such third party stockholders, as applicable, and _third_ , all
Other Securities requested to be included in such registration; and

 

(iv) the Company shall not be required to give notice of, or effect any
registration of Registrable Securities under this Section 3 incidental to,
the registration of any of its securities in connection with mergers,
consolidations, acquisitions, exchange offers, subscription offers, dividend
reinvestment plans or stock options or other employee benefit or compensation
plans. 

 



7 (b) In connection with any Underwritten Offering under this Section 3, the
Company shall not be required to include the Registrable Securities of a
Holder unless such Holder accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon
between the Company and the lead managing underwriter(s), which shall be
selected by the Company. 

(c) No registration of Registrable Securities effected under this Section 3
shall relieve the Company of its obligations (if any) to effect registrations
of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2\.



   4. | HOLDBACKS; OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. 
---|--- 

(a) In connection with any Underwritten Offering, if requested by the managing
underwriter, each Holder agrees to enter into customary agreements restricting
the public sale or distribution of equity securities of the Company
(including sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) during the
period commencing on the launch of such offering but no earlier than ten (10)
days prior to the "pricing" of such Underwritten Offering and continuing for
not more than sixty (60) days after the date of the "final" prospectus (or
"final" prospectus supplement if the Underwritten Offering is made pursuant to
a shelf registration statement), pursuant to which such Underwritten Offering
shall be made, or such lesser period as is required by the lead managing
underwriter(s).

 

(b) If any Demand Registration or Shelf Takedown involves an Underwritten
Offering, the Company, if requested by the managing underwriter, will not
effect any public sale or distribution of any common equity (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common equity) (other than
a registration statement on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any successor forms thereto
or any other form for the registration of securities issued or to be issued in
connection with a merger, acquisition or employee benefit plan) for its own
account within sixty (60) days after the effective date of such
registration except as may otherwise be agreed between the Company and the
lead managing underwriter(s) of such Underwritten Offering.

(c) The Company covenants and agrees during the term of this Agreement,
without the prior written consent of the Holders, not to enter into any Other
Registration Rights Agreement that (i) contains registration rights in favor
of a third party that would have priority to the rights of Holders contained
in this Agreement or (ii) grants any third party with a right to cause the
Company to effect a registration similar to the Demand Registration during
such period (unless the Holders are permitted to participate pro rata with
such third party in such registration).

(a) If and whenever the Company is required by the provisions of this
Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect or cause a
registration as provided in this Agreement and at such times as customarily
occur in registered offerings or shelf takedowns, as applicable, the Company
shall as expeditiously as reasonably practicable:

 

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC, a

thereby are no longer Registrable Securities or 180 days after such
registration statement becomes effective with respect to registrations
pursuant to Section 2(a), in every case as any such period may be extended

for such registration statement to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by
such registration statement;

 

(iii) if requested by the lead managing underwriter(s), if any, or the Holders
of a majority of the then outstanding Registrable Securities being sold in
connection with an Underwritten Offering, to the extent reasonably acceptable
to the Company, include in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment
such information as the lead managing underwriter(s), if any, and such
Holders may reasonably request in order to permit the intended method of
distribution of such securities and make all required filings of such
prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment within the time period
specified in this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to take any actions under this Section 5(a)(iii) that are not, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, in compliance with applicable Law;

managing underwriter(s), if any, copies of all such documents proposed to be
filed, which documents will be subject to the review and reasonable comment of
such counsel, and other documents reasonably requested by such counsel,
including any comment letter from the SEC. The Company shall not file any such
registration statement or prospectus or

 



9  any amendments or supplements thereto with respect to a Demand Registration

basis, unless, in the opinion of the Company, such filing is necessary to

statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus)
and each free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities
Act) (a "Free Writing Prospectus") utilized in connection therewith and any
other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and (c) such
number of copies of other documents, in each case as Holders or such

necessary to enable such Holders and underwriters to consummate the
disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such
Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to
(a) qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation or as a dealer

Offering of shares, if any, may reasonably request consistent with this
Agreement;

(ix) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement to be registered with, or approved by,

any, as required to enable the Holders thereof to consummate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities;

 



10 (x) use commercially reasonable efforts to list the securities covered by such
registration statement on the New York Stock Exchange, if the listing of such
Registrable Securities are then permitted under the applicable rules of such

qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose, (d) of the occurrence of any event which requires the making of any
changes to a registration statement or related prospectus so that such

therewith (including those reasonably requested by the managing underwriters,
if any) as are customary and reasonably necessary to expedite or facilitate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in that regard, in an
Underwritten Offering (i) make such representations and warranties to the
Holders of such Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, with
respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the
registration statement, prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, in each case, in form,
substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers in Underwritten
Offerings, and, if true, confirm the same if and when requested, (ii)

and the lead managing underwriters(s), if any, to

 



11  evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties made
pursuant to sub-clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary
conditions contained in the underwriting agreement entered into by the
Company, (iii) use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its
independent accountants to deliver to the Company (and to the Holders of
Registrable Securities being sold in any registration) an accountants
comfort letter (or, in the case of any such Person which does not satisfy the
conditions for receipt of a "comfort" letter specified in Statement on
Auditing Standards No. 72, an "agreed upon procedures" letter) substantially
similar to that in scope delivered in an underwritten public offering and
covering audited and interim financial statements included in the registration
statement and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the
Holders of Registrable Securities being included in any such registration an
opinion of counsel in substance and scope to that customarily delivered to
underwriters in public offerings, addressed to the underwriters; the above
shall be done at each closing under such underwriting or similar agreement,
or as and to the extent required thereunder;

(xiv) in connection with any Underwritten Offering, to extent the managing
underwriter(s) of such offering shall request, have appropriate officers of
the Company prepare and make presentations as part of a customary "road show",
which may be videotaped or otherwise electronically delivered, and other
information meetings reasonably organized by the underwriters, in each case
upon reasonable advance notice and at mutually agreed times and otherwise use
its reasonable best efforts to cooperate as reasonably requested by the
Holders and the underwriters in the offering, marketing or selling of the
Registrable Securities, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall only
be required to participate in any "road show" once in any 365-day period;

(xv) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and each underwriter
or agent participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and
their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made
with FINRA; and

(xvi) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement, or the lifting of
any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any
of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction at the earliest
reasonable practicable date, except that, subject to the requirements of
Section 5(a)(vii), the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to
(A) qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of this clause
(xvi) be obligated to be so qualified, (B) subject itself to taxation in
any such jurisdiction or (C) file a general consent to service of process in
any such jurisdiction.

(b) The Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities being sold
in a registration hereunder and each underwriter, if any, to furnish to the
Company in writing such information regarding such Holder or underwriter and
the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time
to time reasonably request to complete or amend the information required by
such registration statement.

(c) Upon the receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any
event of the kind described in clause (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section
5(a)(xi), Holders shall forthwith 

 



12  discontinue any offer and disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration statement and prospectus covering such Registrable Securities
until all Holders shall have received copies of a supplemented or amended
prospectus which is no longer defective, or until it is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed, and, if
so directed by the Company, shall deliver to the Company, at the Companys
expense, all copies (other than permanent file copies) of the defective
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities which are then in the Holders
possession. If the Company shall provide any notice of the type referred to
in the preceding sentence, the period during which the registration statements
are required to be effective as set forth under Section 5(a)(i) shall be
extended by the number of days the Holder is required to discontinue
disposition of such securities.



   6. | UNDERWRITING. 
---|--- 

(a) If requested by the underwriters for any Underwritten Offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration hereunder, the Company will
enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement with
the underwriters for such offering, such agreement to contain such
representations and warranties by the Company and such other terms and
provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with
respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, customary
provisions relating to indemnities and contribution and the provision of
opinions of counsel and accountants letters.

(b) If any registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall involve, in whole
or in part, an Underwritten Offering, the Company may require Registrable
Securities requested to be registered pursuant to Section 3 to be included in
such underwriting on the same terms and conditions as shall be applicable to
the securities being sold through underwriters under such registration. In
such case, Holders, if requesting registration, shall be a party to any such
underwriting agreement. Such agreement shall contain such representations and
warranties by the Holders requesting registration and such other terms and
provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements
with respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation,
provisions relating to indemnities and contribution.

(c) In any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration
hereunder, if requested by the managing underwriter, Holders shall also enter
into such additional or other agreements as may be customary in such
transactions, which agreements may contain, among other provisions, such
representations and warranties as the Company or the underwriters of such
offering may reasonably request (including, without limitation, those
concerning Holders their Registrable Securities, Holders intended plan of
distribution and any other information supplied by it to the Company for use
in such registration statement), and customary provisions relating to
indemnities and contribution.

 



   7. | INFORMATION BLACKOUT; SUSPENSION OF SALES. 
---|--- 

(a) Upon written notice from the Company to Holders that the Company has
determined in good faith that (1) sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
registration statement would require disclosure of non-public material
information (A) which disclosure the Company has determined would not be in
the best interest of the Company if disclosed at such

 



13  time (including at any time during a "blackout period" in accordance with
the Companys trading policies) or (B) relating to a material financing or
business transaction involving the Company or (2) a registration statement
contains or may contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (an " _Information Blackout_ "), the
Company may postpone the filing or initial effectiveness of any registration
statement required hereunder and, if such registration statement has become
effective, the Company shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement and Holders shall suspend sales of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement, in each case, until deemed
advisable in the good faith judgment of the Company, and for a period of no
longer than sixty (60) days after the Company makes such good faith
determination, which may, upon advanced written notice to Holders, be renewed
for an additional sixty-day period (such period a " _Blackout Period_ ");
provided, the Company shall not have the right to initiate a Blackout Period
more than two times in any twelve month period.

(b) Any delivery by the Company of notice of an Information Blackout during
the forty-five (45) days immediately following effectiveness of any
registration statement effected pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof shall give
the Holders the right, by written notice to the Company within twenty (20)
Business Days after the end of such Blackout Period, to cancel such
registration.

 

(c) If one or more Information Blackouts should occur, then (1) the applicable
periods of time that Holders may require the Company to effect the number of
Demand Registrations or Shelf Takedowns set forth in Section 2(b) shall be
extended by an aggregate number of days equal to the total number of days in
the Blackout Period(s) and (2) the termination of this agreement pursuant to
Section 23 hereof shall be extended by an aggregate number of days equal to
the total number of days in the Blackout Period(s).



   8. | RULE 144. 
---|--- 

With a view to making available to the Holders of Registrable Securities the
benefits of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the filing requirements
described in Rule 144(c)(1) or any successor thereto. Upon the written
request of Holders, the Company will deliver a written statement as to whether
it has complied with the filing requirements under Rule 144(c)(1) or any
successor thereto and will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Holders (including facilitating the delivery of customary opinions of counsel)
to remove any restrictive legends contained on any certificates (other than
those required by applicable Law) so as to facilitate a sale by the Holders of
such shares under Rule 144.



   9. | PREPARATION; REASONABLE INVESTIGATION; INFORMATION 
---|--- 

(i) In connection with the preparation and filing of each registration
statement registering Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, (i) the
Company will give the Holders and underwriters, if any, and their respective
counsel and accountants, drafts of such registration statement for their
review and comment prior to filing, (ii) during normal business hours and
subject to such reasonable limitations as the Company may impose to prevent
disruption of its business, the Company will provide the underwriters, its
counsel and accountants, as well as

 



14  counsel and accountants to Holders (the " _Inspectors_ "), reasonable and
customary access to the Companys books and records, including, if reasonably
requested, all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the " _Records_ ") and
cause appropriate officers, managers and employees of the Company to supply
all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector as shall be
necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters, its counsel and
Holders counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the Securities Act; provided, however, the Company shall not be required to
provide any information if (A) the Company believes, after consultation with
counsel for the Company, that to do so would cause the Company to forfeit any
attorney-client privilege that was applicable to such information or (B)
either (1) the Company has requested and been granted from the SEC
confidential treatment of such information contained in any filing with the
SEC or documents provided supplementally or otherwise or (2) the
Company reasonably determines in good faith that such Records are
confidential and so notifies the Inspectors in writing; unless prior to
furnishing any such information with respect to clause (1) or (2) such Holder
requesting such information enters into, and causes each of its Inspectors to
enter into, a confidentiality agreement on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to the Company; provided, further, that each Holder agrees that it
will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of
competent jurisdiction or by another governmental authority, give notice to
the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate
action seeking to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential, and
(iii) without limiting the generality of Section 9(b), as a condition
precedent to including any Registrable Securities in any such registration,
the Company may require each Holder and each underwriter, if any, to furnish
the Company in writing such information regarding such Holder or underwriter
and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from
time to time reasonably request in writing or as shall be required by
applicable Law or the SEC in connection with any registration.

(b) Not less than five (5) Business Days before the expected filing date
of each registration statement pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall
notify each Holder of Registrable Securities who has timely provided the
requisite notice hereunder entitling such Holder to register Registrable
Securities in such registration statement of the information, documents and
instruments from such Holder that the Company or any underwriter reasonably
requests in connection with such registration statement, including a
questionnaire, custody agreement, power of attorney, lock-up letter and
underwriting agreement (the " _Requested Information_ "). If the Company has
not received, on or before the second (2nd) Business Day before the expected
filing date, the Requested Information from such Holder, the Company may file
the registration statement without including Registrable Securities of such
Holder. The failure to so include in any registration statement the
Registrable Securities of a Holder of Registrable Securities (with regard
to that registration statement) shall not result in any liability on the part
of the Company to such Holder.



   10. | INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. 
---|--- 

(a) In the case of each offering of Registrable Securities made pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder and its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, members and shareholders, each Person, if any,
who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the

 



15  Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such Holder or such other
indemnified Person and the officers, directors, members and shareholders of
each such controlling Person, (" _Holders Indemnitees_ "), from and against
any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties,
charges, amounts paid in settlement, expenses of investigation and reasonable
and documented attorneys fees and expenses (" _Losses_ "), as incurred,
arising out, caused by, resulting from or based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration
statement (or in any preliminary prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or final
prospectus included therein) relating to the offering and sale of such
Registrable Securities, or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
prospectus only, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading and; _provided,_ that the Company shall not be liable to any
Holders Indemnitee in any such case to the extent that any Losses arises out
of, or is based upon, any information furnished to the Company in writing by
or on behalf of Holders specifically for use in the preparation of
the registration statement (or in any preliminary or final prospectus
included therein), or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or due to
such furnished information having an omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading.

(b) In the case of each offering of Registrable Securities made pursuant to
this Agreement in which a Holder is participating, Holders shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, members and shareholders and each
Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company and such other
indemnified Persons and the officers, directors, members and shareholders of
each such controlling Person (the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), from and against
any and all Losses arising out of or based upon, any information contained in
the registration statement (or in any preliminary prospectus, Free Writing
Prospectus or final prospectus included therein) relating to the offering and
sale of such Registrable Securities or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein (in the case of a prospectus only, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that
such untrue statement is contained in, or such fact is omitted from,
information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of Holders
specifically for use in the preparation of such registration statement (or in
any preliminary or final prospectus included therein). The aggregate
liability of the Holders under this Section 10(b) shall not exceed the total
net proceeds received by all such Holders from such offering giving rise to
such liability.

 

(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be
instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Section 10, such Person (the " _indemnified party_ ") shall
promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
_indemnifying party_ ") in writing;  _provided_ that the failure of any
indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its obligations provided for in Section 10(a) or (b),
except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by
such failure to give notice. In case any such proceeding shall be brought
against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled
to participate therein and, to the

 



16  extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel of its
choosing and shall pay as incurred the reasonable fees and disbursements of
such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any
indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay
as incurred the fees and expenses of one specified counsel retained by the
indemnified party in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the
named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
representation of both parties by the same counsel, in the written opinion of
such counsel, would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall
not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm for all such indemnified parties. The indemnifying party shall
not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent but if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the
indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against
any loss or liability by reason of such judgment. No indemnifying party will
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which (A) does
not include as an unconditional term the giving by the claimant or plaintiff,
to the indemnified party, of a release from all liability in respect of such
claim or litigation or (B) involves the imposition of equitable remedies or
the imposition of any non-financial obligations on the indemnified party.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable in respect of any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred
to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of all parties in connection with
the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the party and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.

The Parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this Section 10(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by
any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this Section 10(d). The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above
shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(d), no
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation and no indemnifying
party shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total price at which the securities were offered

 



17  to the public by the indemnifying party exceeds the amount of any damages
which the indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
an untrue statement or omission.

 

(e) The indemnity provided for hereunder shall not inure to the benefit of any
indemnified party to the extent that such indemnified party failed to comply
with the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as
then applicable to the Person asserting the loss, claim, damage or liability
for which indemnity is sought. The indemnification provided for under this
Agreement shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities (but shall
not inure to the benefit of any transferee, other than a Holder) and the
termination of this Agreement.

 



   11. | EXPENSES. 
---|--- 

In connection with any registration under this Agreement, the Company shall
pay all Registration Expenses. Holders shall be responsible for all other
expenses incurred in connection with such registration, including any
underwriting discounts, selling commissions, brokerage fees and stock
transfer taxes attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities by the
Holders, or the fees and expenses of any legal counsel and any other advisors
engaged by the Holders.

 



   12. | MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION. 
---|--- 
 

In the event the Company engages in a merger or consolidation in which the
shares of Common Stock are converted into securities of another company,
appropriate arrangements will be made so that the registration rights provided
under this Agreement continue to be provided to Holders by the issuer of such
securities.

 



   13. | NOTICES. 
---|--- 

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall
be deemed given if delivered personally, by facsimile (which is confirmed) or
sent by an overnight courier service, such as Federal Express, to the Parties

19 WAIVER. 
---|--- 

This Agreement (including, to the extent referred to in this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement, together with the several agreements and other documents and
instruments referred to herein or therein or annexed hereto or thereto) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) other than as provided in Section
10, is not intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any waiver of any
obligation of the other Parties shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such waiving Party. The failure of
any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any
other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this
Agreement.



   15. | PARAGRAPH HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION. 
---|--- 

The descriptive headings used herein are inserted for convenience of reference
only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. "Include," "includes," and "including"
shall be deemed to be followed by "without limitation" whether or not they are
in fact followed by such words or words of like import. The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The word "will" shall be construed to have the
same meaning and effect as the word "shall." The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Any contract, instrument or Law defined or referred to herein
means such contract, instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of contracts or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of Laws) by succession of comparable successor
Laws and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. This Agreement is the product of negotiations by the Parties having
the assistance of counsel and other advisers. It is the intention of the
Parties that this Agreement not be construed more strictly with regard to one
Party than with regard to the others.

 



   16. | APPLICABLE LAW. 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

 



   17. | SEVERABILITY. 
---|--- 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void,
unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or

 



20  invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner materially
adverse to any Party hereto. Upon any such determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable
substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible and to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.



   18. | ENFORCEMENT; EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the district courts of the
State of Maryland or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State
of New York without proof of actual damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each Party agrees not to oppose the granting of such relief in the event a
court determines that such a breach has occurred, and to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy. In addition, each of the Parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself,
and hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the district
courts of the State of New York and any federal court located in the State of
New York, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to
plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that
any judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement in any court other than the district courts of the State of New York
or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal
courts, any federal court located in the State of New York and (d) consents
to service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in
Section 13\.



   19. | WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. 
---|--- 
 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.



   20. | COUNTERPARTS. 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
two or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Parties (including by facsimile or via portable document format
(.pdf)), it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

 



21 ---|--- 
 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, provided, however, that any Blackstone Fund may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part to any Stockholder in
connection with a Permitted Transfer (as defined in the Stockholders
Agreement). Any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding on the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



   22. | PUBLICATION. 
---|--- 

Each Holder (i) hereby consents to and authorizes the publication and
disclosure by the Company in any press release or registration statements
filed with the SEC (including any documents and schedules filed in connection
therewith) or other disclosure document required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, its identity and the nature of its
commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant to this Agreement and
such other information required in connection with such publication or
disclosure (" _Stockholder Information_ "), and (ii) hereby agrees to
cooperate with the Company in connection with such filings, including
providing Stockholder Information requested by the Company. As promptly
as practicable, each Holder shall notify the Company of any required
corrections with respect to any Stockholder Information supplied by a Holder,
if and to the extent such Holder becomes aware that any such Stockholder
Information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.



   23. | EFFECTIVE DATE; TERMINATION. 
---|--- 

__This Agreement shall be effective as of the Closing Date, and if the Merger
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, then this Agreement
shall terminate and be null and void _ab initio_. After the Closing Date,
this Agreement shall automatically terminate on the earlier of (x) the date
that the Holders cease to hold Registrable Securities representing more than
two percent (2%) of the outstanding Common Stock and (y) three (3) years from

or indirectly, by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or Merger LLC, will, subject
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement);

 

WHEREAS, upon the consummation of the Merger, subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, the undersigned stockholders shall have the right to
receive, in respect of their shares of Company Common Stock, the Merger

per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into
the Merger Agreement, the undersigned stockholders have agreed to enter into
this Agreement.

warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I

promulgated under the Securities Act and any Investment Fund, vehicle or
holding company of which such Stockholder or an Affiliate of such Stockholder
serves as the general partner, managing member or discretionary manager or
advisor; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Affiliate of a Stockholder shall not include any portfolio company or other
investment of any such Person or of such Stockholder or any Investment Fund,
vehicle or holding company, or any limited partners of such Stockholder, in

the right to acquire such Securities is exercisable immediately or only after
the passage of time, including the passage of time in excess of 60 days, the
satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of any event or any
combination of the foregoing). The terms " _Beneficially Own_ ," "

above, Confidential Information also includes all non-public information

of Parent, in each case that such Stockholder has Beneficial Ownership of on

at such time that (a) any Confidential Information with respect to Parent or
its Subsidiaries is made available to investment professionals of such
Stockholder and its Affiliates who are not involved in the private equity
business and who are involved in such other business or investment or (b) such
Stockholder or any of its Affiliates instructs any such business or investment
to take any action, to the extent that such action would violate any
provision of this Agreement that would be applicable to such business or
investment were it to be deemed to be a Stockholder hereunder.

 

" _Permitted Transferee_ " means, with respect to a Stockholder, any Affiliate
of such Stockholder that is an Investment Fund. 

" _Pinnacle Designee_ " means the individual designated by the Stockholders to
serve as a member of the Parent Board in accordance with and subject to

Power or the Total Economic Interest and (y) one (1) year after the date on
which there is no Stockholders Director serving as a director on the Parent
Board (as defined below) (and the Stockholders either no longer have any
rights under Article II to designate a Pinnacle Designee to serve on the
Parent Board or have irrevocably waived any such rights).

" _Stockholder_ " means each Person (other than Parent) whose name appears on
the signature pages hereto and any Permitted Transferee of such Person who
becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) hereof (each
Stockholder, collectively, the " _Stockholders_ ").

appointed to the Parent Board.

" _Stockholder Ownership Limit_ " means a percentage equal to the percentage
of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock Beneficially Owned by the
Stockholder as of immediately following the Merger; provided, that, in either
case, the effect of any share repurchases by Parent shall not be counted for
purposes of any measurement of the Stockholder Ownership Limit (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, none of the Stockholders shall be required to sell or
otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent Common Stock as a consequence of any
such repurchase or any other similar action undertaken by Parent) unless and
until any Stockholder has acquired Beneficial Ownership of additional shares
of Parent Common Stock following such repurchase.

swap, agreement, transaction or series of transaction is to be settled by
delivery of securities, in cash or otherwise.

the Total Voting Power Beneficially Owned by any Person as of any date of
determination is the percentage of the

 



5  Total Voting Power of Parent that is represented by the total number of

Stock (and any other Parent Securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors of Parent) then Beneficially Owned by such Person.

(by operation of law or otherwise), of any capital stock or interest
(including voting interest) in any capital stock (it being understood that no

ARTICLE II

PARENT BOARD COMPOSITION

Section 2.1 _Composition of Parent Board at the Effective Time_. Parent shall
take all actions necessary so that as of the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, (i) the size of the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_
") shall be increased by one and (ii) the Parent Board shall be comprised of
(A) the directors of the Parent Board as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) subject to Section 2.2(e) below, Prakash Melwani or
such other individual as the Stockholders may request prior to the Effective
Time that (x) is reasonably acceptable to Parent and (y) otherwise meets the
requirements of a Stockholder Designee as set forth in Section 2.2(e) hereof
(the " _Initial Designee_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any
vacancy exists on the Parent Board immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent may elect to fill the vacancy through the appointment of the Initial
Designee in lieu of increasing the size of the Parent Board.

 

Section 2.2 _Composition of Parent Board following the Effective Time_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this
Section 2.2 (including Section 2.2(e)), at each annual or special meeting of
the stockholders of Parent at which directors are to be elected to the Parent
Board, Parent will nominate and use its reasonable best efforts (which shall,
subject to applicable Laws, include the inclusion in any proxy
statement prepared, used, delivered or publicly filed by Parent to solicit
the vote of its stockholders in connection with any such meeting the
recommendation of the Parent Board that stockholders of Parent vote in favor
of the slate of directors, including the Pinnacle Designee) to cause the
stockholders of Parent to elect to the Parent Board a slate of directors which
includes, prior to the Termination Date, the Pinnacle Designee.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the Termination Date, the Stockholders shall
provide Parent with its designee for the Pinnacle Designee, together with all
information about the proposed Pinnacle Designee as shall be reasonably
requested by Parent Board or any nominating committee thereof (" _Information_
"), within 30 days of receipt of a written request from Parent for such
Information, but in any event prior to Parents deadline for inclusion of such
Information in a proxy statement for a meeting of stockholders. If the
Stockholders fail to designate the Pinnacle Designee to stand for election as
a member of the Parent Board at such

 



6  meeting prior to such time, then Parent shall have the right, in lieu of the
Stockholders, to nominate to stand for election as a member of the Parent
Board, in accordance with the Constituent Documents of Parent, such
individual that the Stockholders so failed to designate.

(c) Subject to Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(e), from the Effective Time
until the Termination Date, in the event of the death, disability, removal or
resignation of the Stockholders Director, the Parent Board will promptly
appoint as a replacement Stockholders Director, the Pinnacle Designee
designated by the Stockholders to fill the resulting vacancy, and such
individual shall then be deemed the Stockholders Director for all purposes
hereunder _;_ _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein (but subject to, and without limitation of, the
immediately following proviso), without limiting the rights of the
Stockholders under this Section 2.2 with respect to subsequent annual or
special meetings of the stockholders of Parent at which directors are to be
elected to the Parent Board, neither Parent nor the Parent Board shall be
under any obligation to appoint the Stockholders Director to the Parent Board
in the event of the failure of the Pinnacle Designee to be elected to the
Parent Board at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of Parent at
which the Pinnacle Designee stood for election but was nevertheless not
elected _;_ _provided_ , that in the event the Pinnacle Designee is
not elected to the Parent Board then, subject to Section 2.2(e), Parent shall
appoint a replacement Pinnacle Designee to the Parent Board.

 

(d) On the Termination Date, or as promptly thereafter as reasonably
practicable, the Stockholders shall cause the Stockholders Director to resign
and shall have no further rights to appoint a Pinnacle Designee. Prior to
appointment or election to the Parent Board, the Pinnacle Designee shall
execute an agreement providing for such designees resignation from the Parent
Board in the event the Stockholders no longer have a right to designate a
Pinnacle Designee.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article II, the Stockholders will
not be entitled to designate a Pinnacle Designee to the Parent Board pursuant
to this Article II, and the Parent Board shall not be required to take any
actions with respect to the Pinnacle Designee, in the event the Parent Board
reasonably determines that (a) the election of such Pinnacle Designee to the
Parent Board would cause Parent to not be in compliance with applicable Laws,
(b) such Pinnacle Designee has been involved in any of the events
enumerated in Item 2(d) or (e) of Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act or Item
401(f) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act or is subject to any order,
decree or judgment of any Governmental Entity prohibiting service as a
director of any public company or (c) such Pinnacle Designee is not
reasonably acceptable to the Parent Board or any nominating committee thereof,
including because such Pinnacle Designee serves as an officer or director of
any Person directly competing with the business of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. In any such case described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the Stockholders will withdraw the designation
of such proposed Pinnacle Designee and, so long as no Termination Date has
occurred, be permitted to designate a replacement therefor (which replacement
Pinnacle Designee will also be subject to the requirements of this Section
2.2(e)).

 



7 ARTICLE III

 

COVENANTS

 

Section 3.1 _Restrictions on Transfers_.

 

(a) _Requirements for any Transfer_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, a Stockholder shall not Transfer any Covered
Parent Shares (i) unless such Transfer is in accordance with all applicable
Laws and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) in one or
more transactions in which, to such Stockholders knowledge, any Person or
Group (as defined in Section 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), after giving effect
to such Transfer, would Beneficially Own five percent (5%) or more of the
Total Voting Power or the Total Economic Interest;  _provided_ , that the
restriction in this clause (ii) shall not apply to Transfers (x) effected
solely through a bona fide underwritten and widely-distributed public offering
pursuant to an exercise of the registration rights provided in the
Registration Rights Agreement or (y) permitted under Section 3.1(b).

(b) _Permitted Transfers_. A Stockholder shall be entitled to Transfer any
Covered Parent Shares at any time (i) to a Permitted Transferee of the
transferring Stockholder, so long as such transferee, in connection with such
Transfer, evidences in writing reasonably satisfactory to Parent such
transferees agreement to be bound by and subject to the terms and provisions
hereof to the same effect as such transferring Stockholder, and upon such
transfer to be deemed a Stockholder hereunder, or (ii) if such Transfer is
solely to tender into a tender or exchange offer commenced by a third party
(for the avoidance of doubt, not in violation of this Agreement) or by Parent
_;_ _provided_ , that with respect to an unsolicited tender or exchange offer
commenced by a third party, such Transfer shall be permitted only if the
Parent Board has affirmatively publicly recommended to Parents stockholders
that such stockholders tender into such offer and has not publicly withdrawn
or changed such recommendation. 

(c) _Lock-Up_.

 

(i) No Stockholder shall Transfer any Covered Parent Shares during the period
from the Effective Time to the date that is 90 days after the Effective Time,
unless such Transfer is made in accordance with Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b).

(ii) From and after the date that is 90 days following the Effective Time,
subject to compliance with Section 3.1(a), as applicable, a Stockholder shall
be entitled to Transfer any Covered Parent Shares (w) in accordance with
Section 3.1(b), (y) pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement or (z) or
to any other Person.

(d) Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of Covered Parent Shares in violation
of this Section 3.1 shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
be null and void ab initio, and Parent shall not, and shall instruct its
transfer agent and other third parties not to, record or recognize any such
purported transaction on the share register of Parent.

 



8 (e) With respect to any Stockholder, any certificates for Covered Parent
Shares shall bear a legend or legends (and appropriate comparable notations
or other arrangements will be made with respect to any uncertificated shares)
referencing restrictions on Transfer, which legend shall state in substance:

 

"The securities evidenced by this certificate may not be offered or sold,
transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except (i)
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), (ii) to the extent applicable,
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any similar rule under the
Securities Act relating to the disposition of securities), or (iii) pursuant
to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The
securities evidenced by this certificate are subject to restrictions on
transfer set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of May 12, 2014,
by and among Parent and certain other parties thereto (a copy of which is on
file with the Secretary of Parent)."

 

(f) Notwithstanding Section 3.1(e), the holder of any certificate(s) for
Covered Parent Shares shall be entitled to receive from Parent new
certificates for a like number of shares of Parent Common Stock not bearing
such legend (or the elimination or termination of such notations or
arrangements) upon the request of such holder (i) at such time as such
restrictions are no longer applicable and (ii) with respect to the
restriction on Transfer of such shares of Parent Common Stock under the
Securities Act or any other foreign or state securities Laws, unless such
shares of Parent Common Stock are sold pursuant to an effective registration
statement, subject to delivery of an opinion of counsel to such holder, which
opinion is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Parent and its
counsel, that the restriction referenced in such legend (or such notations or
arrangements) is no longer required in order to ensure compliance with the
Securities Act or any such other applicable foreign or state securities Laws.

 

(g) Without limiting any other provision of this Article III, prior to any
Transfer of Covered Parent Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii)(z), the
Stockholder will discuss with Parent their contemplated plans for the orderly
disposition of Covered Parent Shares by such Stockholder; provided, that the
foregoing shall not affect any Stockholders ability to Transfer any Covered
Parent Shares, which shall be in such Stockholders sole and absolute
discretion so long as in compliance with this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2 _Standstill_. During the Standstill Period, each Stockholder
agrees that such Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its Restricted
Affiliates and its and their Representatives acting at its or their direction
or on its or their behalf (such Stockholders, Restricted Affiliates and
Representatives acting in such manner, being the " _Restricted Persons_
") not to, in each case, whether directly or indirectly, (i) acquire, agree
to acquire, propose or offer to acquire, or facilitate the acquisition or
ownership of, shares of Parent Common Stock, or Securities of Parent that are
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into shares of Parent Common Stock,
other than as a result of any stock split, stock dividend or subdivision of
shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) deposit any Covered Parent Shares into a
voting trust or similar Contract or subject any Covered Parent Shares to any
voting agreement, pooling arrangement or similar arrangement or other Contract
(other than solely between or among the Stockholders), or grant any proxy with
respect to any Covered Parent Shares (other than (A) pursuant to Section 3.4
or (B) otherwise to Parent or a Person specified by Parent in a proxy card
provided to stockholders of Parent by or on behalf of Parent), (iii) enter
into, or agree, propose or offer to enter into, or facilitate any merger,
business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, change in control
transaction or other similar extraordinary transaction involving Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, (iv) make, or in any way participate or engage in, any
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the

 



9  proxy rules of the SEC) to vote, or advise or knowingly influence any Person
with respect to the voting of, any Securities of Parent (other than to vote as
recommended by the Parent Board), (v) call, or seek to call, a meeting of the
stockholders of Parent or initiate any stockholder proposal for action by
stockholders of Parent, (vi) form, join or in any way participate in a Group
(as defined in Section 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) with respect to any
Securities of Parent, (vii) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to
seek to control or influence the management or the policies of Parent (
_provided_ , that this clause (vii) shall in no way limit the activities of
the Stockholders Director taken in good faith solely at meetings of the Parent
Board or any committee thereof), (viii) publicly disclose any intention, plan,
arrangement or other Contract prohibited by, or inconsistent with, the
foregoing or (ix) advise or knowingly assist or encourage or enter into any
discussions, negotiations, agreements, or arrangements or other Contracts with
any other Persons in connection with the foregoing. The Stockholders
further agree that, during the Standstill Period, the Stockholders shall not,
directly or indirectly, and shall cause their respective Restricted Persons
not to, directly or indirectly (a) request to Parent to amend or waive any
provision of this Section 3.2 (including this sentence) or (b) take any
action that would reasonably be expected to require Parent to make a public
announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination, merger or
other type of transaction or matter described in this Section 3.2. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
at all times during the Standstill Period, the Stockholders agree that their
aggregate Beneficial Ownership, on a fully diluted basis, of Parent Common
Stock or securities of Parent that are convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable into Parent Common Stock, shall not exceed the Stockholder
Ownership Limit.

 

Section 3.3 _Stock Dividends, Distributions, Etc._ In the event of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution, or any change in
the Parent Common Stock or other Securities of Parent by reason of any
recapitalization, combination, reclassification, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the term "Covered Parent Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and
include all such stock dividends and distributions and any Securities into
which or for which any or all of such shares may be changed or exchanged or
which are received in such transaction.

 

Section 3.4 _Voting of Covered Parent Shares_. During the Standstill Period,
each Stockholder agrees to cause all of its Covered Parent Shares to be voted
by proxy (returned sufficiently in advance of the deadline for proxy voting
for Parent to have the reasonable opportunity to verify receipt) mailed to the
stockholders of Parent in connection with the solicitation of any proxy: (x)
in favor of all those persons nominated to serve as directors of Parent by the
Parent Board or any nominating committee thereof, (y) in favor of the removal
of the Stockholders Director as and when contemplated by Section 2.2(d) and
(z) with respect to any other action, proposal or other matter to be voted
upon by the stockholders of Parent, in accordance with the recommendation of
the Parent Board (but only so long as such recommendation is not inconsistent
with the rights of the Stockholders under this Agreement).

ARTICLE IV

 

TERM

Effective Time, and if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, then this

 



10  Agreement shall terminate and be null and void _ab initio_. Article II of
this Agreement shall continue in effect until the Termination Date, at which
time Article II shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. Upon
the termination of the Standstill Period, this entire Agreement shall be
deemed terminated and shall have no further force and effect; except that
Article VII (other than Sections 7.3 and 7.4) and the confidentiality

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and

need not sign the same counterpart.

 

Section 7.9 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Schedules hereto and, to the extent referred to in this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement, together with the several agreements and
other documents and instruments referred to herein or therein or annexed
hereto or thereto) (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) is not
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

Section 7.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in
a manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon any such determination,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort

 



16  to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible and to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be fulfilled to the maximum extent
possible.

Section 7.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such consent
shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 7.12 _Headings; Interpretation_. The descriptive headings used herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be
part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
"Include," "includes," and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by
"without limitation" whether or not they are in fact followed by such words
or words of like import. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the
word "shall." All Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Contract,
instrument or Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract,
instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of Laws) by succession of comparable successor Laws and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. This
Agreement is the product of negotiations by the Parties having the assistance
of counsel and other advisers. It is the intention of the Parties that this
Agreement not be construed more strictly with regard to one Party than with
regard to the others.

 

Section 7.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

Section 7.14 _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the district courts of the State of Maryland
or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested
in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Maryland
without proof of actual damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees
not to oppose the granting of such relief in the event a court determines that
such a breach has occurred, and to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. In addition, each of the
Parties

 



17  hereto (a) consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the
personal jurisdiction of the district courts of the State of Maryland and any
federal court located in the State of Maryland, in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying
of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than the district
courts of the State of Maryland or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in the
State of Maryland and (d) consents to service of process being made through
the notice procedures set forth in Section 7.7.

Section 7.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 7.16 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as parties hereto (and in the case of the Stockholders, each of their general
partners) and no former, current or future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of any party
hereto or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager,
agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ")
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to
this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce
this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.16 shall in no way be deemed to
limit the liability or obligations of any Party to the extent that such Party
is required to cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives to take
any action or refrain from taking any action pursuant to this Agreement and
Parent shall be entitled to enforce the obligations of the Restricted Persons
set forth in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 3.2 hereof
directly against such Restricted Persons.

Section 7.17 _Freedom to Pursue Opportunities_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the parties expressly acknowledge and agree
that: (i) each Non-Recourse Party has the right to, and shall have no duty
(contractual or otherwise) not to, directly or indirectly engage in the same
or similar business activities or lines of business as Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including those deemed to be competing with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) in the event that a Non-Recourse Party acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate
opportunity for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, such Non-Recourse Party
shall have no duty (contractual or otherwise) to communicate or present such
corporate opportunity to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, and shall not be liable to Parent or its Affiliates or stockholders
for breach of any duty (contractual or

 



18  otherwise) by reason of the fact that such Non-Recourse Party, directly or
indirectly, pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such
opportunity to another person, or does not present such opportunity to
Parent; provided, that any Stockholders Director who is offered an investment
or business opportunity in his or her capacity as a member of the Parent Board
shall be obligated to communicate such opportunity to Parent and none of (i)
the Stockholders or (ii) any of their respective "affiliates" (as defined in
Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act and any Investment Fund, vehicle
or holding company of which such Stockholder or any such affiliate serves as
the general partner, managing member or discretionary manager or advisor)
shall be permitted to pursue such opportunity unless the Parent Board or the
Chief Executive Officer of Parent determines not to do so on a
reasonably timely basis under the circumstances; provided, further, that
clause (ii) in the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to or limit
any such affiliate that is separately offered such investment or business
opportunity directly by a third party and not involving the Stockholders
Director in an auction scenario (e.g., in which the opportunity is presented
to Stockholders Director on behalf of Parent and other strategic and/or
private equity investors, including affiliates of Stockholders).

Section 7.18 _Sponsor Related Parties_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent acknowledges that certain of Stockholders
Affiliates and other platforms trade debt securities and syndicated bank debt
and originate loans (including the provision of debt financing for
transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement) and nothing herein shall restrict the ability of such Affiliates or
platforms to trade debt securities and syndicated bank debt and originate
loans in the ordinary course of business. In addition to, and without
limitation of, the foregoing, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary: none of the provisions of this Agreement shall in any way limit
the activities of (i) Non-Private Equity Businesses or (ii) any portfolio
company of an Affiliate of The Blackstone Group L.P., provided that a
Representative of such portfolio company does not receive Confidential
Information or take any action at the direction or instruction of, or on
behalf of, any of the Stockholders or any of the Restricted Persons.

Agreement, all as of the date first written above.
