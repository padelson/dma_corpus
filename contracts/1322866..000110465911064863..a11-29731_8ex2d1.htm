time after the acquisition of the same and the resolution of any Title

pursuant to an assignment and bill of sale substantially similar to the

6.1 Access.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement (including this _Section 6.1_) and obtaining any
required consents of Third Parties, Seller shall afford to Buyer, its
Affiliates and each of their officers, employees, agents, accountants,
attorneys, investment bankers, consultants and other authorized
representatives (collectively, " ** _Buyer s Representatives_**") reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the Properties and all Records in
Sellers or any of its Affiliates possession. Seller shall also make
available to Buyer and Buyers Representatives, upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours, Sellers personnel knowledgeable with respect to the
Properties in order that Buyer may make such diligence investigation as Buyer
considers necessary or appropriate. All investigations and due diligence
conducted by Buyer or any of Buyers Representatives shall be conducted at
Buyers sole cost, risk and expense; and any conclusions made from any
examination done by Buyer or any of Buyers Representatives shall result from
Buyers own independent review and judgment. Buyer shall coordinate its access
rights and physical inspections of the Properties with Seller and any
applicable Third Party that serves as an operator (each a " ** _Third Party
Operator_** ") to reasonably minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of
the conduct of business by Seller or any Third Party Operator. Seller shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain permission for Buyer and Buyer
Representatives to gain access to Properties operated by a Third Party
Operator to inspect the condition of such Properties. Buyer shall give Seller
reasonable prior written notice before entering onto any of the Properties and
Seller shall have the right to have its representatives present at any time
any Buyers Representative is present on the Properties. Buyer shall, and
shall cause all of the Buyers Representatives to, abide by Sellers and any
Third Party Operators safety rules, regulations and operating policies of
which they are notified in advance while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Properties including any environmental or other inspection
or assessment of the Properties.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not conduct any sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive
investigation activities upon the Properties (" ** _Invasive Activities_** ")
without the prior written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld
as provided under this _Section 6.1(b)_. In the event that Buyer, acting in
good faith, reasonably determines that a Property requires additional
inspection, including the use of Invasive Activities, Buyer may, by written
notice, request Sellers consent to conduct Invasive Activities (" **
_Inspection Request_** "). The Inspection Request shall include the specific
Property that would be subject to the Invasive Activities, the reasons for
requesting Invasive Activities and a description of the proposed Invasive
Activities to be conducted by Buyer. Seller shall consent to or deny the
Inspection Request within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Inspection
Request, provided that consent from Seller shall not be unreasonably withheld
and that the failure of Seller to respond within such three (3) Business Day
period shall be deemed to constitute Sellers consent to the Inspection
Request and the proposed Invasive Activities. If Seller withholds its consent
to any Inspection Request, then

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer may elect to deem the respective Property a Retained Property and the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of such
Property in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)(iv)_.

 



 

(c) Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each of the operators
of the Properties and the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and
all Liabilities arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit,
environmental property assessment, monitoring or observing operations or other
due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any of Buyers Representative
(including an Invasive Activity, if any) with respect to the Properties,
**EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE
SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES**.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall disclose to Seller its final environmental reports and test
results. Neither Buyer by its delivery of said documents nor Seller by its
receipt of said documents shall be deemed to have made any representation or
warranty, expressed, implied or statutory as to the condition to the
Properties or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained
therein.

 



 

(e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall, at its sole cost
and expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates (i)
repair all physical damage done to the Properties in connection with Buyers
due diligence and (ii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought
onto the Properties in connection with Buyers due diligence.

Seller and Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and neither Buyer nor Seller,
respectively, shall have any liability for, any Title Benefit or Title Defect
for which Buyer or Seller, respectively, has not received a Title Notice on or
before the Defect Deadline.

 



 

(b) On or before the Closing, with respect to each Lease or DSU for which

with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then such amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the amount necessary
to be paid to remove such encumbrance from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual NPE
Lease Net Revenue Interest in any Lease and (B) the NPE Lease Net Revenue
Interest stated on _Exhibit A_ or _Schedule 5.7_ with respect to such Lease,
then the Title

 



      
 

 



 

Defect Amount shall be the product of (1) the Allocated Value of such Lease
_multiplied by_ (2) one (1), _minus_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the
actual NPE Lease Net Revenue Interest for such Lease and the denominator of
which is the NPE Lease Net Revenue Interest for such Lease stated on _Exhibit
A_ or _Schedule 5.7_ ;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual Non-
Consent Net Revenue Interest for any DSU and (B) the Non-Consent Net Revenue
Interest stated on _Exhibit A_ with respect to such DSU, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of (1) the Allocated Value of such DSU _multiplied
by_ (2) one (1), _minus_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Non-
Consent Net Revenue Interest for such DSU and the denominator of which is the
Non-Consent Net Revenue Interest for such DSU stated on _Exhibit A_ ;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy such that the actual
aggregate Net Mineral Acres in a Lease is less than the Net Mineral Acres set
forth for such Lease on _Exhibit A_ or _Schedule 5.7_ , then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product obtained by multiplying the difference between
such Net Mineral Acres amounts in the applicable Lease by the DSU Average
Acreage Cost applicable to such Lease;

 



 

(vi) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or encumbrance upon, or
other defect in title to, the Title Defect Property of a type not described
above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, the portion of such Title
Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title
Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of
such Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer
and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; _provided_ , that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable of
being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable
cost and expense of curing such Title Defect;

 



 

(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to any Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 



 

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

 



 

(b) The amount by which the Allocated Value of any Lease or DSU is increased
as a result of the existence of a Title Benefit with respect thereto is the "

the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then such amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual NPE
Lease Net Revenue Interest in any Lease and (B) the NPE Lease Net Revenue

 



      
 

 



 

Interest stated on _Exhibit A_ or _Schedule 5.7_ with respect to such Lease
(and the NPE Lease Working Interest in such Lease is not increased
proportionately), then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of (1)
the Allocated Value of such Lease _multiplied by_ (2) the result obtained by
subtracting one (1) from a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual NPE
Lease Net Revenue Interest for such Lease and the denominator of which is the
NPE Lease Net Revenue Interest for such Lease stated on _Exhibit A_ or
_Schedule 5.7_ , respectively;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual
Non-Consent Net Revenue Interest in any DSU and (B) the Non-Consent Net
Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit A_ with respect to such DSU (and the Non-
Consent Working Interest in such DSU is not increased proportionately), then
the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of (1) the Allocated Value of
such Lease _multiplied by_ (2) the result obtained by subtracting one (1) from
a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Non-Consent Net Revenue
Interest for such Lease and the denominator of which is the Non-Consent Net
Revenue Interest for such Lease stated on _Exhibit A_ ; and.

 



 

(iv) the Title Benefit Amount with respect to any Title Benefit shall be
determined without duplication of any benefits included in another Title
Benefit Amount hereunder.

pursuant to _Section 6.6(c))_ or with respect to which Seller provides the

windstorm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage, accident or
other casualty of a similar nature or shall be taken by condemnation or under

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, except for the
rights of Buyer with respect to Title Defects and Environmental Defects
provided under Article VI, the rights and remedies of Buyer set forth in this

Casualty Loss with respect to the Properties.

 



 

6.9 Preferential Purchase Rights.

 



 

(a) Seller shall transmit all required notices with respect to preferential
right to purchase provisions relative to any Property (" ** _ _PPRs__** ") set
forth in _Schedule 4.1(n)_ , promptly after the execution of this Agreement
but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after execution of this
Agreement by the Parties. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer if
any PPRs are exercised or if the requisite period has elapsed without said
rights having been exercised.

 



 

(b) If a Person to whom a notice of a PPR has been given elects to purchase
the Properties covered by such PPR in accordance with the Applicable Contract,
then such Properties may be sold to such holder of the PPR subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and such Properties will not be sold
to the Party originally executing this Agreement as "Buyer" (subject to the
remaining provisions in this Section) and the Purchase Price will be reduced
by the Allocated Value of such Property in accordance with _Section
3.2(b)(iv)_. Upon the consummation of the sale of any Properties to the holder
of such PPR, such Properties shall be deemed excluded from the transactions
contemplated hereby for all purposes.

 



 

(c) If by Closing, the time frame for the exercise of a PPR applicable to a
Property has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent not
to exercise or a waiver of the PPR, such Property shall be excluded from the
sale under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the
Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Property in
accordance with _Section 3.2(b)(iv)_.

 



 

(d) If, after the Closing, the holder of a PPR with respect to any Property
excluded pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ fails to consummate the purchase of
such Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of such PPR or if
the time frame in which to exercise PPR expires without exercise, then, within
ten (10) Business Days of Sellers providing Buyer with notice thereof, Buyer
shall purchase (at a purchase price equal to the Allocated Value thereof, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.2_ through the date of such assignment), and
Seller shall assign to Buyer pursuant to an assignment in substantially the
same form as the Assignment, such Property.

 



 

6.10 Applicable Consents.

 



 

(a) Seller shall transmit all required notices with respect to consents from
Third Parties required prior to Closing to assign the Properties (such
consents, other than

 



      
 

 



 

Customary Post Closing Consents, " ** _Applicable Consents_** ") set forth on
_Schedule 4.1(n)_ promptly after the execution of this Agreement but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after execution of this Agreement by
the Parties. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all Applicable Consents. Buyer shall reasonably assist Seller with those
efforts.

 



 

(b) If (i) Seller fails to obtain a Applicable Consent set forth in _Schedule
4.1(n)_ prior to Closing and the failure to obtain such Applicable Consent
would (1) cause the assignment of the Properties affected thereby to Buyer to
be void, (2) give rise to an express right of the counterparty to terminate
the Applicable Contract or Lease, or (3) cause the termination of an
Applicable Contract or Lease under the express terms thereof, (ii) an
Applicable Consent requested by Seller is denied in writing, or (iii) an
Applicable Consent is required from a Governmental Authority, then, in each
case, (x) the Property (or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained
Applicable Consent shall be excluded from the Properties to be assigned to
Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Property (or portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that any
such Applicable Consent (with respect to a Property excluded pursuant to this
_Section 6.10(b)(i)_) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained
within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, then, on the tenth (10th)
Business Day after such Applicable Consent is obtained, Seller shall assign
the Property (or portion thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such
previously un-obtained Applicable Consent to Buyer pursuant to an instrument
in substantially the same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to
Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with
respect to the Property (or portion thereof) so excluded (as adjusted pursuant
to _Section 3.2_ through the date of such assignment).

 



 

(c) If Seller fails to obtain an Applicable Consent set forth in _Schedule
4.1(n)_ prior to Closing (i) and the failure to obtain such Applicable Consent
would not (1) cause the assignment of the Conveyed Interest (or portion
thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be void, (2) give rise to an express
right of the counterparty to terminate the Applicable Contract or Lease, or
(3) cause the termination of an Applicable Contract or Lease under the express
terms thereof, (ii) such Applicable Consent requested by Seller is not denied
in writing by the holder thereof, and (iii) such Applicable Consent is not
required from a Governmental Authority, then the Property (or portion thereof)
subject to such un-obtained Applicable Consent shall nevertheless be assigned
by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part of the Properties. Any Liability that
arises due to the failure to obtain such Applicable Consent shall be borne
solely by Buyer.

 



 

6.11 Special Warranty. Buyer shall not assert any claim under the special
warranty of title under the Assignment (a) with respect to any matter that
Buyer had the right to assert a claim under this _Article VI_ and (b) until
such time that the Title Threshold and the Title and Environmental Deductible
has been fully satisfied.

 



 

6.12 Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyers remedies hereunder for a breach of
Sellers representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4.1(n)_ or
_4.1(t)_ , the rights and remedies of Buyer set forth in this _Article VI_ ,
shall be Buyers exclusive rights and remedies with respect to any defect of
title (including any Title Defect) or any Environmental Defect or any
Environmental Liability with respect to the Properties.

presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Accounting Expert.

which was not intended by the Parties to be conveyed to Buyer, including the
Excluded Assets. From and after the Closing, at the request of Buyer but
without further consideration, Seller shall execute and deliver or use
reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and delivered such other

the tenth (10th) day after Seller has been replaced as the operator of record
of the Properties, it will cease using the Seller Marks in any manner,
directly or indirectly, and remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all
Seller Marks from the Properties. The Parties acknowledge and agree (i)
because damages would be an inadequate remedy, that Seller shall be entitled
to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach
of this _Section 10.4_, in addition to other remedies available to it at law
or in equity, and (ii) that the covenant of Buyer set forth in this _Section
10.4_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely, including following any
subsequent transfer of the Properties by Buyer, without limitation as to time.

 



 

10.5 Registration Rights.

 



 

(a) If (i) Seller holds Parent Consideration Shares that it desires to sell
and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation
to Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable
Seller to dispose of the number of Parent Consideration Shares it desires to
sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under the Securities
Act, then upon the request of Seller, Parent shall file with the SEC as
promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use all reasonable
efforts to cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not
less than six (6) months following its effective date or such shorter period
as shall terminate when all Parent Consideration Shares covered by such
registration statement have been sold, a registration statement under the
Securities Act registering the offering and sale of the number of Parent
Consideration Shares specified by Seller; _provided, however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to effect more than three (3) registrations pursuant to
this _Section 10.5_; and _provided further, however_ , that if at the time a
request pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ is submitted to Parent requesting
registration and the board of directors of Parent determines in its good faith
judgment that a postponement of the requested registration for up to six (6)
months would be in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders due to a
pending transaction, investigation or other event, the filing of such
registration statement or the effectiveness thereof may be deferred for up to
six (6) months, but not thereafter. In connection with any registration
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall promptly prepare
and file (x) such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the
securities subject to such registration under the securities laws of such
states as Seller shall reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that no such
qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result
thereof, Parent would become subject to general service of process or to
taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or
partnership doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such
registration, and (y) such documents as may be necessary to apply for listing
or to list the Parent Consideration Shares subject to such registration on
such National Securities Exchange as Seller shall reasonably request, and do
any and all other acts and things that may reasonably be necessary or
advisable to enable Seller to consummate a public sale of such Parent
Consideration Shares in such states. Except as set forth in _Section
10.5(b)_, all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other
than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by Parent,
without reimbursement by Seller. Parent shall cause any Parent Consideration
Shares issued at the Closing to be listed on the NYSE prior to the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this _Section 10.5_, Parent shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further,
Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold
harmless Seller Indemnified Parties against any Liabilities resulting to,
imposed upon or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties, directly or
indirectly, under the Securities Act or otherwise based upon, arising out of
or resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in any registration statement under which any Parent
Consideration Shares were registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities or blue sky laws, in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to
the effective date of such registration statement), or in any summary or final
prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the
period Parent is required to keep the registration statement current), or
arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein not misleading; _provided, however_ , that
Parent shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnified Party to the extent that
any such Liabilities arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such registration statement, such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or
such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to Parent by or on behalf of such Seller Indemnified
Party specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

 



 

(c) The provisions of _Section 10.5(a)_ _Section 10.5(b)_ shall continue to
be applicable with respect to Seller for so long thereafter as is required for
Seller to sell all of Parent Consideration Shares with respect to which it has
requested inclusion in a registration statement otherwise filed or that a
registration statement be filed. The provisions of _Section 10.5(b)_ shall
continue in effect thereafter.

 



 

(d) Any request to register Parent Consideration Shares pursuant to this
_Section 10.5_ shall (i) specify the number of Parent Consideration Shares
intended to be offered and sold by Seller, (ii) express Sellers present
intent to offer such shares for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or
method of the proposed offer and sale of the Parent Consideration Shares, and
(iv) contain the undertaking of Seller to provide all such information and
materials and take all action as may be required in order to permit Parent to
comply with all applicable requirements in connection with the registration of
such Parent Consideration Shares.

 



 

10.6 Required Financial Statements.

 



 

(a) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer and Parent as and when needed in respect of the Required
Financial Statements and the related Opinion issued by the Accounting Expert,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to respond to SEC comment
letters in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall
retain, or caused to be retained, all books, records, information and
documents that may be necessary in connection with the preparation and audit
and/or review of financial statements required under applicable Law and
applicable to Parent or its Affiliates with respect to the Properties.

 



      
 

 



 

10.7 Post-Effective Time Accounts Receivables. In the event that as of the
Final Settlement Date, Seller has not collected all outstanding accounts
receivable relating to or associated with a period of time following the
Effective Time that are owed to Seller from the other working interest owners
in the DSUs set forth on Exhibit A that Seller previously operated, then, on
the Final Settlement Date, (i) Seller shall assign, transfer and convey to
Buyer all such accounts receivable and to the extent transferable, any and all
rights of Seller associated therewith, including lien rights, pursuant to a
form of assignment without representation or warranty of any kind except a
special warranty of title by, through and under Seller, and otherwise mutually
acceptable to the Parties, and (ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available United States dollars, the aggregate amount
of such outstanding, unpaid accounts receivable.

 



 

10.8 Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

(a) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of
(i) the end of the first full calendar month following Closing or (ii) the

by Seller in performing the Services. Seller shall provide Buyer an invoice
detailing any such out-of-pocket costs and expenses at the end of the

within 30 days of Buyers receipt of such invoice. In the event there is any
dispute with respect to such amounts, Buyer and Seller shall work in good
faith to resolve such disputes.

 



 

(c) In order that Buyer may become familiar with the Services provided by the
employees of Seller and make orderly arrangements for the provision of such
Services after the expiration of the Transition Period, Buyer, upon the prior
written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld, will be entitled
to consult with employees on the staff of Seller that perform the Services,
during normal business hours and at the corporate offices of Seller during the
period that those employees are providing the Services described in this
_Section 10.8_ , provided that those consultations do not unreasonably
interfere with the performance by those employees of their duties.

 



 

(d) Seller shall maintain such records as it normally keeps for its own
internal purposes in connection with the Services. Promptly following the
expiration of the Transition Period, Seller shall deliver those records to
Buyer, provided that Seller may retain copies of any such records.

 



 

(e) **SELLER DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING THE
SERVICES, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF

(b) any breach by Parent of Parents representations, warranties or covenants
set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

(c) the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

11.2 Sellers Indemnity Obligation. If the Closing shall occur, then effective
from and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
4.4_ and otherwise herein, Seller and its successors and assigns shall be
responsible for, shall pay, and will DEFEND, INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS each
of Buyer and Parent and their respective Affiliates, and all of its and their

11.3 Deductible, Threshold and Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, Seller shall have no obligation or liability for

any demand, assertion, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any
Third Party with respect to any matter to which it believes itself to be
entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it shall give

statement of such information regarding any of the foregoing as it shall then

the application of the Indemnity Threshold, the Indemnity Deductible and the
Indemnity Cap) upon the indemnified partys providing an initial notice for a
claim of indemnity to the indemnifying party. Seller, on one hand, and Buyer
and Parent on the other, must provide any such notice within the Seller
Survival Period and Buyer Survival Period, respectively; otherwise, all
indemnifications granted by the respective Party hereunder shall terminate and
expire. The indemnified party shall afford the indemnifying party a reasonable
opportunity to pay, settle or contest the claim at the indemnifying partys
expense.

behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, indirect, special, consequential,

respect to any dispute arising out of, resulting from, based on, associated
with or relating to, this Agreement, the breach hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement or any claim
arising out of, resulting from or related to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and each Party hereby releases, waives and discharges, and covenants
not to sue (and shall cause its Affiliates to waive, discharge and covenant
not to sue) with respect to, any cause of action not expressly provided for in
this Agreement, including claims under state or federal securities Laws and
claims available at common law, in equity or by statute.**

provisions provided for in this Agreement shall be applicable whether or not

Article XII 
ARBITRATION

 



 

12.1 Arbitration.

 



 

(a) Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to any Disputed Defect
Matter shall be settled by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association
(" ** _AAA_** ") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (" ** _Rules_** ") as
modified by this _Article XII_.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator then
within thirty (30) days after a notice of arbitration is filed by either
Party, then such arbitrator(s) shall be chosen in accordance with the Rules.

 



 

(c) Any arbitration of any Disputed Defects Matter pursuant to _Article VI_ of
this Agreement, shall be determined by a single arbitrator (the " ** _Defects
Arbitrator_** "). The Defects Arbitrator shall be either an attorney with at
least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles, operations and
transactions with respect to matters involving Title Defects, or an
environmental consultant with at least ten (10) years experience, with respect
to matters involving Environmental Defects, (in each case) selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller. Absent such agreement, by the AAA, provided
that in no case shall the Defects Arbitrator have any substantial relationship
with any Party or any Affiliate of either Party during the two (2) years prior
to such selection. The Defects Arbitrators award shall be made within twenty
(20) days after submission of the Disputed Defect Matters and shall be binding
on and non-appealable by the Parties. In making his determination, the Defects
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in _Article VI_. Subject to
the foregoing, the Defects Arbitrator may consider such other matters as in
the opinion of the Defects Arbitrator are necessary to make a

 



      
 

 



 

proper determination; _provided, however_ , that with respect to any
arbitration concerning a Title Defect Amount, Title Benefit Amount or an
Environmental Defect Amount, the Defects Arbitrator may not award Buyer (or
Seller, if applicable) a greater amount than the amount claimed by Buyer (or
Seller, if applicable) in its Title Notice or Environmental Notice, as
applicable. The Defects Arbitrator shall determine only each specific Disputed
Defect Matter, and, (unless the Disputed Defect Matter relates to a Title
Defect Amount), the corresponding Title Benefit Amount or (as the case may be)
the Environmental Defect Amount. The Defects Arbitrator may not award monetary
amounts to either Party with respect to any Disputed Defect Matter.

 



 

12.2 Additional Procedures. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith in the
voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and
information (including electronically stored information) relevant to any
Disputed Defect Matter, including copies of all documents in their possession
or control on which they rely in support of the position or which they intend
to introduce as exhibits at a hearing. The necessity of additional information
exchange shall be determined by the arbitrator (or Accounting Expert, as the
case may be) based upon the reasonable need for the requested information, the
availability of other discovery options and the burdensomeness of the request
on the opposing Parties and the witness.

 



 

12.3 Location. The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado, unless
another place is determined to be mutually acceptable to the Arbitrator(s),
Buyer and Seller. Pending the final decision of the Arbitrator(s) of any
Disputed Defect Matter, all Parties will proceed diligently with performance
of all contract obligations, including the payment of all sums not in dispute,
required by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties reserve
the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of
obtaining security or other provisional relief to satisfy or effectuate an
eventual arbitration award, including attachment and injunctive relief. The
commencement of any action for such relief in aid of arbitration shall not
constitute a waiver of the right to arbitration nor shall it prejudice in any
way the right to proceed to arbitration.

 



 

12.4 Written Decision or Award. The written decision or award of the
Arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the Parties and the Parties
shall abide by and comply with such decision and a judgment may be rendered
upon such decision or award in a court of competent jurisdiction. Buyer and
Parent on one hand, and Seller on the other, shall equally bear the cost of
the services and expenses of the Arbitrator(s) and all other costs of the
arbitration proceedings.

 



 

12.5 Authority of Arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
12.5_, any Arbitrator (or Accounting Expert) shall have no authority to award
incidental, indirect, special, consequential (including lost profits or other
consequential or business interruption damages or any other damages not
measured by actual damages), multiple, statutory, punitive or exemplary
damages with respect to any dispute arising under, related to, or in
connection with this Agreement, the breach hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby. This limitation of losses and damages shall apply to any
arbitration no matter when the proceeding is initiated.

 



 

12.6 Confidentiality. Except to the extent necessary to enforce a decision and
award of the Arbitrator(s), to enforce other rights of the Parties hereunder,
or as required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which
the securities of either Party or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates are listed or are in the process of being listed, the Arbitrator(s)
and Parties, and their counsel, consultants and other representatives, shall
maintain as confidential the fact any proceedings are ongoing, or have been
completed, under this _Article XII_ , any decision and award of the
Arbitrator(s) and all documents prepared and submitted by either Party, or its
counsel, consultants and other agents and representatives, in connection with
any proceedings under this _Article XII_.
