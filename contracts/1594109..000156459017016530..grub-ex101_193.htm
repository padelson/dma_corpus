NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements and
undertakings contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
each intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 

Asset Transfer; Purchase and Sale of the Units

 

Section 1.01.Asset Transfer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and the Asset Transfer Agreement, Seller shall, or shall cause
the applicable Seller Companies to, transfer the Transferred Assets to the

Section 2.01.Closing.

 

(a)The closing of the Acquisition (the "Closing") shall be held at the offices
of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, at
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver) of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than (i) delivery of items to be
delivered at the Closing and (ii) satisfaction of conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the
occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items
and the satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed between Purchaser and Seller. The date
on which the Closing takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Closing Date". The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of 12:01 a.m.,
New York City time, on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time").

 

(b)At or prior to the Closing, Seller and/or the Company shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Purchaser:

 

(i)a certificate of transfer with respect to the Units duly endorsed by
Seller;

 

(ii)the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(a);

 

(iii)the Transition Services Agreement, duly executed by Seller;

 

(iv)the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by Seller;

 

(v)(x) a certificate, duly completed and executed as of the Closing Date,

and (y) and IRS Form W-9;

 

(vi)the Seller Release, duly executed by Seller;

 

(vii)written resignations, effective immediately after the Closing, of all

shall no longer be members of the board of managers or officers, as
applicable, of the Company; and

 

(viii)the Closing Date Financing Deliverables.

   

(c)At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller
and the Company:

 

(i)by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account that is
designated in writing by Seller at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, an amount equal to the Closing Date Purchase Price less the
Escrow Amount;

 

(ii)by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Escrow Amount to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement;

 

(iii)the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 8.02(a);

 

(iv)the Transition Services Agreement, duly executed by Purchaser; and

 

(v)the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by Purchaser and the Escrow Agent.

 

Section 2.02.Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a)Not less than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated Statement")
setting forth Seller's good faith estimated calculation of the Closing Date
Purchase Price, including (i) the Closing Date Upward Working Capital
Adjustment, (ii) the Closing Date Downward Working Capital Adjustment, (iii)
the Closing Date Indebtedness Estimate and (iv) the Closing Date Selling
Expenses Estimate (collectively, the "Closing Date Purchase Price Elements"),
together with reasonable supporting detail and documentation. Each of the
Closing Date Purchase Price Elements shall be determined in a manner
consistent with and in accordance with the Statement Principles. Seller shall
revise the Estimated Statement to reflect any changes reasonably proposed by
Purchaser which shall be provided to Seller no later than two (2) Business
Days following the delivery of the Estimated Statement.

 

(b)Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Statement") setting forth its calculation
of the Final Purchase Price, including its determination of (i) the Final
Upward Working Capital Adjustment, (ii) the Final Downward Working Capital
Adjustment, (iii) the Final Indebtedness and (iv) the Final Selling Expenses
(collectively, the "Final Purchase Price Elements"). Each of the Final
Purchase Price Elements shall be determined (x) in a manner consistent and in
accordance with the Statement Principles and without duplication of any item
and (y) without giving effect to any adjustments resulting from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (other than Selling
Expenses incurred as a result of the Closing and the Asset Transfer, which for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be reflected in the Final Purchase Price
Elements) or any actions taken by or on behalf of Purchaser with respect to
the Company at or following the Closing.

 

(c)The Statement shall become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser and
used for the purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to Section
2.02(d) and Section 2.02(e) on the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery
thereof, unless Seller gives written notice to Purchaser of its disagreement
with the Statement and any Final Purchase Price Element set forth in the
Statement (a "Notice of Disagreement") prior to such date. Any Notice of

   

Disagreement shall be signed by an authorized officer of Seller and shall (i)
specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted, (ii)
include only disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on any Final
Purchase Price Element not being calculated in accordance with the definition
thereof or the Statement Principles, as applicable, and this Section 2.02 and
(iii) specify the amount that Seller reasonably believes is the correct amount
of such Final Purchase Price Element based on the disagreements set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement, including a reasonably detailed description of the
adjustments applied to the Statement in calculating such amount. If the
Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Seller prior to the expiration of such
thirty (30)-day period, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this
Section 2.02) shall become final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the
earlier of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing all
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement and (B) the date all disputed matters are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm. During the thirty (30)-day period following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and agree on a final
and binding determination of such disputed Purchase Price Element(s). During
such period, Purchaser and its independent auditors shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Seller and its independent auditors prepared in
connection with the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty
(30)-day period, if no agreement on any such disputed Purchase Price
Element(s) has been reached, then Seller and Purchaser shall submit in writing
their positions with respect to any and all matters that remain in dispute and
that were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement to an
internationally recognized independent accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm")
for resolution of any and all such matters in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Accounting Firm shall be Ernst and Young or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to act, such other Big Four accounting firm as shall be
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser in writing or, if the parties are unable
to so agree in writing within ten (10) days after the end of such thirty
(30)-day period, then Seller and Purchaser shall each select an
internationally recognized independent accounting firm and such firms shall
jointly select a third internationally recognized independent public
accounting firm to resolve the disputed matters. Seller and Purchaser shall
jointly instruct the Accounting Firm that it (1) shall act as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, (2) shall review only the matters that were properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement and which remain in dispute, (3) shall
make its determination in accordance with the requirements of this Section
2.02 and based solely on the written submissions of Seller and Purchaser and
their respective independent auditors and not by independent review, (4) shall
not assign a value for any item that remains in dispute that is greater than
the greatest value, or smaller than the smallest value, set forth by either
Seller or Purchaser in their written submissions to the Accounting Firm and
(5) shall render its written decision as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after submission to the Accounting Firm of
all matters in dispute. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which
such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting
Firm, which proportionate allocations also shall be determined by the
Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees, costs and expenses
of Purchaser incurred in connection with its preparation of the Statement, its
review of any Notice of

   

Disagreement and its preparation of any written submissions to the Accounting
Firm shall be borne by Purchaser, and the fees, costs and expenses of Seller
incurred in connection with its review of the Statement, its preparation of
any Notice of Disagreement and its preparation of any written submissions to
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller. All determinations made by the
Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute
resolution mechanism contained in this Section 2.02(c) shall be the exclusive
mechanism for resolving disputes regarding any adjustments to the Closing Date
Purchase Price.

 

(d)If the Closing Date Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall, and if the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Date
Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
Statement becomes final and binding on Seller and Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.02(c), make payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds
of the amount of such difference to an account designated by the recipient of
such payment.

 

(e)Each line item of the Closing Working Capital shall be calculated (i) in
the same manner, using the same Accounting Policies as the corresponding line
item of the Target Working Capital set forth in the sample calculation set
forth on Section 2.02(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule was calculated, and
(ii) without giving effect to the Acquisition or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (but, for the avoidance of doubt, giving effect
to the Asset Transfer and taking into account Selling Expenses incurred as a
result of the Closing). The foregoing principles are referred to in this
Agreement as the "Statement Principles". The Purchase Price adjustment
contemplated by this Section 2.02 can only be effected as intended by Seller
and Purchaser if the calculations of the Target Working Capital and the
Closing Working Capital are done in the same manner, using the same Accounting
Policies, in accordance with the sample calculations set forth on Section
2.02(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether there were
mathematical errors in the Statement and whether the calculation of the Final
Purchase Price Elements was done in accordance with the respective definitions
thereof or the Statement Principles, as applicable, and this Section 2.02, and
the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether the Accounting
Policies were followed in calculating the Target Working Capital set forth in
the sample calculation set forth on Section 2.02(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, the Final Purchase Price Elements or the Statement or as to whether
the Target Working Capital set forth in the sample calculation set forth on
Section 2.02(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is correct.

 

(f)Until the date on which the Statement shall become final and binding on the
parties pursuant to Section 2.02(c), each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that,
following the Closing, it shall afford and cause to be afforded to the other
party and any accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained by such
other party in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 2.02, access upon reasonable notice during normal
business hours to their respective properties, books, contracts, personnel and
Records to the extent relating to the Company, and its respective accountants'
work papers relevant to the preparation of the Statement, any Notice of
Disagreement and the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.02 and shall
provide such other party, upon such other party's reasonable request

   

and at such other party's expense, with copies of any such books, contracts,
Records and work papers.

 

Section 2.03.Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Seller
or any other person such amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any applicable Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the
applicable Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.04.Allocation of Purchase Price.

 

(a)As soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.02, Purchaser
shall prepare an allocation of the Final Purchase Price (and any and other
relevant items for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes) among the assets of the Company, based on the fair market value of
such assets immediately prior to the Closing (the "Allocation"). The
Allocation shall be consistent with Section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any analogous provisions of state,
local or non-U.S. Law. Purchaser and Seller will cooperate with each other in
good faith in preparing the Allocation.

 

(b)If Seller disagrees with Purchaser's Allocation, Seller shall, within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Allocation, deliver a written notice to
Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as to which Seller disagrees
and setting forth Seller's proposed Allocation, in which case Purchaser and
Seller shall, during the twenty (20) days immediately following such delivery,
use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine the appropriate Allocation. If Seller does
not so deliver a written notice to Purchaser specifying those items to which
Seller disagrees and Seller's proposed Allocation, then Seller shall be deemed
to consent to Purchaser's proposed Allocation.

 

(c)If Purchaser and Seller are not able to agree on the Allocation within such
20-day period, Purchaser and Seller shall submit to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, in accordance with the procedural principles of Section 2.02(c)
and this Section 2.04, all remaining disagreements with respect to the
proposed Allocation. The Allocation shall be revised to reflect the fair
market value determinations of the Accounting Firm, if any, together with
items and amounts as to which Purchaser and Seller had previously agreed (or
were deemed to agree), and the Allocation shall be final and binding on
Purchaser, Seller and their respective Affiliates. If any adjustment is
subsequently made to the purchase price hereunder, Seller and Purchaser will
cooperate with each other in good faith to promptly amend the Allocation to
reflect such adjustment.

 

(d)Purchaser and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall report, act, and
file Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the
Allocation as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.04, and neither
Purchaser nor Seller nor their respective Affiliates shall take any position
on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Entity or in any judicial
proceeding that is inconsistent with the Allocation as finally determined
pursuant to this

   

Section 2.04, except to the extent required pursuant to a "determination,"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

contemplated by the Asset Transfer Agreement shall be deemed to have been
consummated prior to the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in the

each other section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and each other Section of
this Agreement to the extent its relevance is reasonably apparent from the
face of such disclosure), each of Seller and the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Purchaser as of the date hereof and as of the Closing follows:

 

Section 3.01.Organization, Standing and Authority; Execution and Delivery;
Enforceability.

 

(a)Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite power
and authority to own, lease, use or otherwise hold assets owned, leased, used
or otherwise held by it to carry on the Business as presently conducted. The
Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite
power and authority to own, lease, use or otherwise hold assets owned, leased,
used or otherwise held by it to carry on the Business as presently conducted.
Each of Seller and the Company is in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation and is in good standing and duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of the Business
or the ownership, leasing or holding of properties used in the Business makes
such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to
be in good standing or so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b)Each of Seller and the Company has all requisite corporate or other
organizational power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or will be a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and comply with

required to be taken by Seller and the Company to authorize the execution,

to which it is a party or will be a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and comply with the terms and conditions
hereof and thereof have been duly and properly taken.

 

(c)This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and the
Company and, prior to Closing, Seller and the Company will have duly executed
and delivered

   

each Other Transaction Document to which Seller or the Company is a party or

executed and delivered by Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes, and, upon the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser of each Other
Transaction Document to which it is specified to be a party, such Other
Transaction Documents will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Seller and the Company, as applicable, enforceable against Seller or the
Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, general principles of equity and the
discretion of courts in granting equitable remedies.

 

Section 3.02.No Conflicts; Consents.

 

(a)The execution and delivery of this Agreement, and each of the Other
Transaction Documents to which Seller or the Company is a party or will be a
party by Seller or the Company does not and will not, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by Seller and
the Company with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof will not (i)
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require any notice with respect to,
or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or to loss of a benefit under, any provision of (A) the Governing
Documents of Seller or the Company, or (B) any Contract to which Seller or the
Company is a party or by which any of them or their respective properties or
assets may be subject, (ii) violate any Injunction or, subject to the matters
referred to in paragraph (b) below, applicable Law, (iii) result in the

(iv) constitute a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Seller
requiring the vote and approval of Seller's stockholders (or equivalent) or
debtholders, other than, solely in the case of clauses (i)(B) and (iii) above,
any such items that, individually or in the aggregate would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b)No consent, waiver, approval, license, permit, order or authorization
(each, a "Consent") of, or filing, application, notification, registration or
other declaration (each, a "Filing") made to or with, any Governmental Entity

and thereof, other than (i) compliance with any Consents and Filings under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (ii) those that may be required solely by
reason of Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' (as opposed to any other third
party's) participation in the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Other
Transaction Documents, (iii) those that would not reasonably be expected to
(A) materially impair or delay the ability of Seller or the Company to perform
their respective

   

obligations under this Agreement or the Other Transaction Documents
contemplated hereby and thereby on a timely basis or result in a violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without the lapse of time or both) a default
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of any obligation of Seller or the Company (with respect to the
Business), under any terms, conditions or provisions of any Material Contract
or Permit or (B) result in material Liability to the Company or otherwise

applicable) in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement, to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally, general
principles of equity and the discretion of courts in granting equitable
remedies), except (i) to the extent that the failure of any such Contracts to
be valid, binding and in full force and effect, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to result in material Liability to
the Company or otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business
and (ii) for the expiration of such Material Contract in accordance with its
express terms after the date hereof. No notice, whether written or oral, has
been received by the Company alleging that it is in breach or default under
any Material Contract except to the extent that any such breach or default,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to result in
material Liability to the Company or otherwise materially interfere with the
conduct of the Business. No event has occurred, is pending, or, to the
knowledge of Seller, is threatened, which (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) would constitute a breach or default by the Company under any
Material Contract or, to the knowledge of Seller, any other party to a

individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to result in
material Liability to the Company or otherwise materially interfere with the
conduct of the Business. A complete and accurate copy of each Material
Contract, including all amendments and modifications thereto, has been made
available to Purchaser.

 

Section 3.09.Permits. The Company validly holds and has complied with all the
terms and conditions of each material Permit held by the Company or is held by
any Seller

   

Company (other than the Company) on behalf of the Company or the Business
(each such Permit, a "Company Permit"), in each case, except for any such
invalidity or non-compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
be reasonably likely to result in material Liability to the Company or
otherwise materially interfere with the conduct of the Business. The Company
possesses all Permits necessary for the operation of the Business, except as
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result
in material Liability to the Company or otherwise materially interfere with
the conduct of the Business. Since February 9, 2015, no Seller Company has
received written notice of any Proceeding relating to the revocation or
modification of any Company Permit, the loss or modification of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to result in
material Liability to the Company or otherwise materially interfere with the
conduct of the Business. No event has occurred that allows, or after notice
or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination of a Company Permit or
results in any other material impairment of the rights of the holder of any
such Company Permit, other than an expiration of such Company Permit in
accordance with its terms.

 

Section 3.10.Proceedings. Since February 9, 2015, there have been no material
lawsuits, claims, suits, actions, charges, complaints, audits, arbitrations,
investigations, inquiries or other proceedings ("Proceedings") pending or, to
the knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller (with respect to the
Business) or the Company or any of their respective directors or officers (in
their capacity as such) or otherwise arising out of or relating to the
Business. Neither the Company nor Seller (with respect to the Business) is a
party or subject to or in default under any material Injunction of any
Governmental Entity or arbitration tribunal applicable to the Company or the
Business.

 

Section 3.11.Benefit Plans.

 

(a)Section 3.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each
material Benefit Plan that covers any Business Employee who provides services
primarily to the Business. With respect to each Benefit Plan, Seller has made
available to Purchaser complete and correct copies of the current plan
document (or a written description of material terms if no plan document
exists) and, if required by applicable Law, the Benefit Plan's summary plan
description. Each Benefit Plan and, if applicable, related trust has been
established, maintained, funded and administered in all material respects and
complies in all material respects, with respect to any Business Employee, with
its terms and all applicable Laws (including ERISA and, the Code). Each
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(a "Qualified Benefit Plan") has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service, or with respect to a prototype or volume
submitter plan, can rely on an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service to the prototype or volume submitter plan sponsor, in each case a copy
of which has been made available to Purchaser, to the effect that such
Qualified Benefit Plan is so qualified and that the plan and the trust related
thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be
expected to cause the revocation of such determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service or the unavailability of reliance on such opinion
letter from the Internal Revenue Service, as applicable or otherwise adversely
affect the qualification of such Benefit Plan. With respect to any Benefit
Plan and any Business Employee, to the knowledge of Seller, no event has
occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that has resulted in

   

or would subject Seller to a Tax under Section 4971 of the Code. No event has
occurred that would subject the Transferred Assets to a lien under Section
430(k) of the Code. All contributions, distributions, reimbursements and
premium payments due with respect to any Business Employee under or pursuant
to each Benefit Plan prior to the Closing will have been timely made as of the
Closing.

 

(b)No Benefit Plan is, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has any
current or contingent liability or obligation under or with respect to: (i) a
plan that is or subject to the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; or (ii) a "multi-employer plan" (as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA). Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has: (A)
withdrawn from any pension plan under circumstances resulting (or expected to
result) in liability; or (B) engaged in any transaction which would give rise
to a liability under Section 4069 or Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

 

(c)Except as set forth on Section 3.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
attached hereto and other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or
other similar applicable Law and for which the beneficiary pays the full
premium cost, no Benefit Plan provides for any Business Employee benefits or
coverage in the nature of health, life or disability insurance following
retirement or other termination of employment or service (other than death
benefits when termination occurs upon death).

 

(d)Except as set forth on Section 3.11(d) attached hereto, no Benefit Plan
exists that could: (i) result in the payment to any Business Employee,
director or consultant of the Business of any money or other property; or (ii)
accelerate the payment, vesting of or provide any additional rights or
benefits (including funding of compensation or benefits through a trust or
otherwise) to any Business Employee, director or consultant of the Business,
in each case, as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e)The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will not (alone or in conjunction with any other event)
(i) result in any material payment becoming due to any Business Employee or
Former Business Employee under any Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially
increase any benefits or compensation otherwise payable to any Business
Employee or Former Business Employee under any Benefit Plan or otherwise, or
(iii) result in the acceleration of time of payment or vesting of, or require
the material funding of, any such benefits or compensation.

 

(f)Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) complies with respect to the
Business Employees in all material respects with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder by its terms and has been
operated with respect to the Business Employees in all material respects in
accordance with such requirements such that no material additional Taxes are
due with respect to any such arrangement under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(g)The Company is not a party to, nor is otherwise obligated under, any plan,
policy, agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state, local

   

or foreign Taxes). No amount or other entitlement that could be received as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in conjunction with
any other event, including any termination of employment) by any "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with respect to the
Company will constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 

Section 3.12.Absence of Changes or Events.

 

(a)Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change,
effect, event or occurrence that has resulted or would reasonably be expected
to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b)Except in connection with or pursuant to the Asset Transfer, from the
Interim Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Business has been conducted in the ordinary course of business in all material
respects and (ii) neither the Company nor Seller has taken any action that
would have required the consent of Purchaser under Section 5.02 had such
action occurred after the date hereof.

 

Section 3.13.Compliance with Applicable Laws.

 

(a)Each of the Company and Seller (with respect to the Business) is, and since
February 9, 2015 has been, in material compliance with all applicable Laws and
Injunctions. Since February 9, 2015, neither the Company nor Seller (with
respect to the Business), has received any written or, to the knowledge of
Seller, oral communication from a Governmental Entity that alleges that any
the Company or Seller (with respect to the Business), is in violation of any
applicable Laws or Injunctions, except for any such violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in material Liability to the Company or otherwise materially interfere with
the conduct of the Business.

 

(b)Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of Seller, any of the Business
Employees (in each case, acting in their capacities as such) has, directly or
indirectly, through its representatives or any person authorized to act on its
behalf (i) violated in any material respect (A) the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, (B) the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Convention
on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business
Transactions and legislation implementing such convention or (C) all other
international anti-bribery conventions and bribery Laws applicable to the
Company (collectively, the "Anti-Bribery Laws") or (ii) offered, paid,
promised to pay, or authorized the payment of any money, or offered, gifted,
promised to give, or authorized the giving of anything of value, to any
Government Official or to any other person: (A) for the purpose of (1)
corruptly or improperly influencing any act or decision of any Government
Official in his official capacity; (2) inducing any Government Official to do
or omit to do any act in violation of their lawful duties; (3) securing any
improper advantage; or (4) inducing any Government Official to use his
respective influence with a Governmental Entity to affect any act or decision
of such Governmental Entity in order to, in the case of each of clause (1),
(2), (3) or (4), assist the Company in obtaining or retaining business for or
with, or directing business to, the Company; or (B) in a manner which would
constitute or have the purpose or effect of public or commercial bribery,
acceptance of, or acquiescence in extortion, kickbacks, or other unlawful or
improper means of obtaining business

   

or any improper advantage. Since February 9, 2015, neither the Company nor
Seller (with respect to the Business) has received any written or, to the
knowledge of Seller, oral communication from a Governmental Entity that
alleges that any manager, officer, employee or authorized agent of the Company
or the Business or any other person acting on behalf of the Company or the
Business is in violation of any Anti-Bribery Law.

 

Section 3.14.Environmental Matters. Except as could not result, individually
or in the aggregate, in material Liability to the Company or otherwise
materially interfere with the conduct of the Business (i) each of the Company

been, in compliance with all Environmental Laws, (ii) the Company possesses

contaminated by, or exposed any person to, any Hazardous Material. Seller and

currently planned, contemplated, or announced. Section 3.15 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule lists all Business Employees who currently have work visas

to work in the jurisdiction in which he or she provides services to the
Business.

collectively as "Permitted Liens").

Section 4.04.Investment Representations.

 

(a)Purchase Entirely For Own Account. Purchaser hereby confirms that (i)
Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and (ii)
the Units to be acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement will be
acquired for investment for Purchaser's own account, not as a nominee or
agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof
in violation of the Securities Act. Purchaser further represents that
Purchaser does not presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or
arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such
person or to any third person, with respect to any of the Units.

 

(b)Disclosure of Information. Purchaser has had an opportunity to ask
questions and receive answers from Seller and the Company regarding the Units. 

 

(c)Restricted Securities. Purchaser understands that the Units have not been,
and will not be as of the date of their issuance to Purchaser, registered
under the Securities Act, and are being sold to Purchaser by reason of a
specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act
which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment
intent and the accuracy of Purchaser's representations expressed in this
Section 4.04. Purchaser understands that the Units are "restricted
securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and that,
pursuant to these laws, Purchaser must hold the Units unless and until they
are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by
state authorities, or an exemption from such registration and qualification
requirements is available, and the certificate or certificates representing
the Units may contain legends to the foregoing effect. Purchaser understands
that no public market exists for any of the securities issued by the Company,
including the Units, and that it is unlikely whether a public market will ever
exist for the securities issued by the Company, including the Units.

 

(d)Corporate Securities Law. THE SALE OF THE SECURITIES THAT IS THE SUBJECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN QUALIFIED WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH SECURITIES OR THE RECEIPT OF
ANY PART OF THE ASSETS FOR SUCH SECURITIES PRIOR TO SUCH QUALIFICATION IS
UNLAWFUL, UNLESS THE SALE OF SECURITIES IS EXEMPT FROM QUALIFICATION BY
SECTION 25100, 25102 OR 25105 OF THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE.

 

Section 4.05.Sufficient Funds. Purchaser will have as of immediately prior to
the Closing sufficient funds on hand and available through liquidity
facilities existing as of immediately prior the Closing to satisfy its payment
obligations to the extent arising under this Agreement or the Other
Transaction Documents and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Other Transaction Documents.

provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any person (other

Units, the Business or any merger, sale or license of all or substantially all
of the Company's assets or the Seller's assets related to the operation of the
Business or similar transaction involving the Company or the Business (each
such transaction, an "Alternative Transaction"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller and the Company may respond to any unsolicited proposal
regarding an Alternative Transaction by indicating that Seller and the Company
are subject to an exclusivity agreement pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to the sale of the Company and the Business and is unable to provide
any information related to the Company or the Business or entertain any
proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning an
Alternative Transaction for as long as this Agreement remains in effect.
Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of any unsolicited proposal, inquiry or
offer by any person (other than Purchaser and/or its Representatives) with
respect to or relating to any Alternative Transaction and shall provide
Purchaser with a summary of the material terms or such proposal, inquiry or
offer.

 

Section 5.04.Company Asset Transfer. Seller and the Company shall (i) take
all steps necessary to effect the Asset Transfer prior to the Closing in
accordance with the

Section 5.05.Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, Seller shall keep
confidential, and cause its Affiliates and cause its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, advisors and other Representatives to keep
confidential, all non-public information relating to the Company or the
Business ("Business Confidential Information"), except (i) as required or
requested by a Governmental Entity or required pursuant to Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange or listing authority or legal,
administrative or judicial process, (ii) for information that is available on
the Closing Date to the public, or thereafter becomes available to the public
other than as a result of a breach of this Section 5.05, or (iii) for
information disclosed in connection with the exercise of any rights or
remedies provided in any Transaction Document or any Proceeding related to any
Transaction Document or the enforcement of rights thereunder. In the event
Seller or any of its Affiliates is required or requested by a Governmental
Entity to disclose such information, Seller or its Affiliate shall promptly
notify Purchaser and the Company in writing, unless prohibited by Law, which
notification shall include the nature of such legal requirement and the extent
of the required disclosure, and shall cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchaser's
expense, to preserve, to the extent possible, the confidentiality of such
information.

 

Section 5.06.Restrictive Covenants.

 

(a)For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Seller will not, nor
will it permit its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) induce or
encourage any Transferred Employee to leave the employment of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates or (ii) solicit for employment, employ or assist any other
person in employing any Transferred Employee; provided, that the foregoing
shall not preclude Seller or any of its Affiliates from (A) placing general
solicitations for employment not specifically directed toward the Transferred
Employees or (B) hiring any such Transferred Employee who (1) has had his or
her employment terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for any
reason, (2) has not been employed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates within
six (6) months prior to the date of hire, or (3) responds to any general
solicitation permitted by the foregoing clause (A).

 

(b)For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company) shall not,
directly or indirectly, engage in the Restricted Business (as defined below)
anywhere in the world, own any interest in, conduct, manage, operate or
control any person engaged in the Restricted Business or actively participate
in, consult with, render services for or furnish advice to any person in
connection with such person's engagement in the Restricted Business. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Restricted Business" means the design,
development, sale, licensing, marketing or provision of any consumer and
corporate online and/or mobile food ordering service business, including
without limitation the provision of delivery services for restaurants;
provided, however, the Restricted Business shall not include, or in any way
restrict the ability of Seller and its Affiliates from, (A) marketing and
engaging in the ordinary course of business of Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company) as conducted as of the date hereof (other than the
operation of the Business), (B) marketing, facilitating, taking and confirming
online and/or mobile food orders via a third party application (e.g., Uber
Eats, Delivery.com or EatStreet), subject to Section 3(a)

   

of the Marketing Partnership Agreement, (C) processing payments for online
and/or mobile food orders via a third party application, or (D) marketing,
facilitating, taking, confirming, and processing payments for online and/or
mobile food orders for in-restaurant consumption. For clarity but without
limitation, nothing herein will affect or limit Seller's obligations under
Sections 3(a), 8(b) and 10(d) of the Marketing Partnership Agreement or under
any other provisions in the Marketing Partnership Agreement that address
restrictions on using Merchant Materials or APIs (as such capitalized terms
are defined therein); provided, further, to the extent that Seller properly
terminates the Marketing Partnership Agreement pursuant to Section 15(b)
thereof, this Section 5.06(b) will be of no further force effect. In
addition, for so long as the Business Confidential Information remains
confidential, Seller will not, nor will it permit its Affiliates to use the
Business Confidential Information for any reason except as expressly permitted
by this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the Marketing
Partnership Agreement.

 

(c)Except as expressly permitted by the Transition Service Agreement and the
Marketing Partnership Agreement, Seller agrees that from and after the Closing
Date it will not use (and it will prevent its subsidiaries or Affiliates from
using) (i) the name "Eat24" or "Eat24Hours" or any other Marks used by the
Company, but excluding the Seller Names and Marks, and (ii) any Marks that are
similar to, or are otherwise variations or derivatives of any of the foregoing
(including translations, abbreviations, adaptations and combinations thereof).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) the appearance
of the foregoing Marks on any other materials that are held by Seller or its
subsidiaries or Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company) for internal use only shall not be a breach of this Agreement or
constitute a violation of the Intellectual Property rights of Purchaser;
provided that (x) within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date,
Seller shall, unless such use shall otherwise expressly permitted by or
necessary to perform its obligations under the Transition Service Agreement
and/or the Marketing Partnership Agreement, remove any and all such
appearances from any internal usage (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
sales and product literature, purchase orders, invoices, packaging,
stationary, labeling, promotional products and all other similar materials),
and (y) Seller and its subsidiaries and Affiliates may use the foregoing Marks
and non-trademark names solely for the purposes of conveying to third parties
or the general public the historical origins of the Business in a manner that
is (1) consistent with past practices, (2) does not disparage Purchaser, its
Affiliates or the Company and (3) required for legitimate business purposes.

 

(d)The parties acknowledge and agree that the amount of actual damages
suffered by Purchaser in the event of an actual or threatened breach of this
Section 5.06 may be difficult or impossible to accurately calculate and there
may not be an adequate remedy at law available to Purchaser to fully
compensate it in the event of such an actual or threatened breach.
Consequently, the parties agree that in addition to any other remedy or relief
to which it may be entitled, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of
this Section 5.06, Purchaser and its successors and assigns shall be entitled
to specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce, or prevent any violations
of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security), and
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will oppose the granting of any such
relief on the ground(s) that Purchaser has an adequate remedy at Law, has not
proven actual damages, and/or should be required to post a bond or other
security.

   

(e)If any provision contained in this Section 5.06 is, for any reason, held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this Section 5.06,
but this Section 5.06 will be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this
Section 5.06 is held to cover a geographic area or to be of a length of time
that is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too
broad or to any extent invalid, such provision will not be construed to be
null, void and of no effect; instead, the parties agree that a court of
competent jurisdiction will construe, interpret, reform or judicially modify
this Section 5.06 to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable
geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those
contained herein) as will be valid and enforceable under such applicable law.

 

(f)Seller expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) each of the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.06 is reasonable in all respects (including with
respect to subject matter, time period and geographical area) and such
restrictions are necessary to protect Purchaser's interest in, and value of,
the Business (including the goodwill inherent therein), (ii) Seller is
primarily responsible for the creation of such value, and (iii) Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement or consummated the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents without the restrictions contained
in this Section 5.06.

 

Article VI 

Covenants of Purchaser

 

Purchaser covenants and agrees as follows:

 

Section 6.01.Confidentiality. Purchaser acknowledges that the information
being made available to it in connection with the Acquisition and the

Transaction Documents is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement
between Purchaser and Seller dated as of February 23, 2017 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the confidentiality
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to
information relating to the Company; provided, that Purchaser acknowledges
that any and all other information made available to it by or on behalf of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any of its or their respective
Representatives, concerning any Seller Subsidiary, Seller or any of its
Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and the
Business) shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.02.No Use of Seller Names and Marks; Transitional License.

 

(a)Except as expressly permitted by the Transition Service Agreement and the
Marketing Partnership Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, promptly, and in any event within: (i) forty-five (45) Business Days after
the Closing Date, (A) amend or terminate any Governing Documents, certificates
of assumed names or "doing business as" filings by such entities so as to
remove from such documents, certificates or filings and

   

eliminate its right to use any of the Seller Names and Marks, and (B) remove
any and all Seller Names and Marks from any websites and other online media
operated in connection with the Business (including any social media, Internet
sites or other or similar uses); (ii) six (6) months after the Closing Date,
remove any and all Seller Names and Marks from any signage on any Leased
Property or other assets, regardless of the form or medium (other than sales
and product literature, purchase orders, invoices, shipping documents,
packaging and labeling and similar materials to the extent permitted under the
Transitional License); and (iii) ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
revise or replace all sales and product literature, purchase orders, invoices,
shipping documents, packaging and labeling and all other similar materials
(regardless of the form or medium) to delete, and cease use of, all references
to any of the Seller Names and Marks; provided, that, with respect to the
foregoing clause (iii), for a period of six (6) months from the Closing Date
(the "Transitional Period"), Purchaser and the Company may continue to
distribute sales and product literature that uses any of the Seller Names and
Marks in the ordinary course of business and only in substantially the same
form, and to substantially the same extent, that such sales and product
literature exist on the Closing Date (the "Existing Materials") or are
otherwise produced in the ordinary course of business within the thirty
(30)-day period after the Closing Date (together with the Existing Materials,
the "Transitional Materials"); provided, in each case, that Purchaser
complies, and causes the Company to comply, with the terms and conditions set
forth herein (including the terms of the Transitional License granted below)
and all applicable Laws.

 

(b)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, and effective only
upon the occurrence of the Closing and during the Transitional Period, Seller
hereby grants, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, to Purchaser and the
Company, a limited, royalty-free, paid-up non-exclusive right and license to
use those Seller Names and Marks and copyrights and other Intellectual
Property owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates (the "Licensed IP") that are
used, as of the Closing Date, by Seller and the Company in the manufacture,
distribution, marketing and sale of the products and services of the Company
included in the Transitional Materials, to the extent necessary to allow
Purchaser and the Company to so use such Transitional Materials during the
Transitional Period in the ordinary course of business in the six (6) months
following the Closing Date (the "Transitional License"). By the end of the
Transitional Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, return
to Seller (or its designee) or destroy any remaining Transitional Materials.

 

(c)As between the parties, Seller is the sole and exclusive owner of all
right, title and interest in and to the Seller Names and Marks and all rights
related thereto and goodwill associated therewith and all Licensed IP; and all
uses of the Seller Names and Marks and the goodwill arising therefrom shall
inure solely to the benefit of Seller. Any use by Purchaser or the Company of
any of the Seller Names and Marks during the Transitional Period is subject to
each of their use of the Licensed IP, including the Seller Names and Marks
included therein, in a form and manner, and with standards of quality, in
effect by Seller and its Affiliates with respect thereto as of the date of
this Agreement and in accordance with all applicable Laws.

 

(d)Seller hereby expressly reserves all rights in and to the Seller Names and
Marks and the Licensed IP, except solely for the limited non-exclusive license
granted to Purchaser and the Company during the Transitional Period. After the
Closing, Purchaser shall

   

not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to not, hold itself out as having
any affiliation with Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) the appearance of the Seller
Names and Marks on any other materials that are held by the Company for
internal use only or as required by or permitted as fair use or otherwise
under applicable Law shall not be a breach of this Agreement or constitute a
violation of the Intellectual Property rights of Seller or its Affiliates so
long as Purchaser and the Company endeavor to remove such appearances in the
ordinary course of business, and (ii) Purchaser and the Company may use the
Seller Names and Marks and non-trademark names to convey to third parties or
the general public the historical origins of the Business, including by
referring to such origins on their websites and in their advertising,
marketing and promotional materials.

 

Article VII 

Mutual Covenants

 

Section 7.01.Publicity. Seller and Purchaser agree that, no public release or
announcement concerning the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be issued by either party or its Affiliates without
the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any U.S. or
non-U.S. securities exchange or listing authority, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance and the party issuing such release shall consider any
reasonable comments in good faith; provided, that each of Seller, the Company
and Purchaser may make internal announcements to their respective employees
that are consistent with such party's prior public disclosures regarding the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and that otherwise have
been made in accordance with this Section 7.01. Seller and Purchaser agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents shall be in the form mutually agreed
upon by Seller and Purchaser.

 

Section 7.02.Efforts.

 

(a)Cooperation. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
their part under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable and in any
event prior to the Termination Date or Extended Termination Date, as
applicable, including using commercially reasonable best efforts to (i)
prepare and file as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary reports and other Filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable
all Consents and registrations necessary to be obtained from any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) execute and deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary
to consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by

   

this Agreement on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Purchaser and Seller
shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable,
each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of
the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Purchaser or
Seller, the Company or the Business, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, Seller and Purchaser
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 

(b)Information. Subject to applicable Laws, Seller and Purchaser shall, upon
reasonable request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers or equityholders, as
applicable, that is reasonably necessary for making any Filing or obtaining
any Consent, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any Filing made (or to be made) by or on behalf
of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including under the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the
performance of each party's respective obligations, Seller and Purchaser may,
as each determines is reasonably necessary, designate competitively sensitive
material provided to the other pursuant to this Section 7.02(b) as "Outside
Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.02(b), materials
provided to the other parties or their counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Business or the Company or
information otherwise not germane to regulatory review.

 

(c)Status. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, Seller and Purchaser shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to Consents or clearances of any Governmental Entity of the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, or any of
their respective Affiliates, from any Governmental Entity with respect to such
Consents or clearances, provided, that such materials may be redacted as
necessary (i) to address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality
concerns or (ii) to comply with applicable Law. Subject to applicable Laws and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, neither Seller nor Purchaser
shall permit any of their respective Affiliates, officers or any other
Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any Consents, clearances, Filings, investigation or other inquiry
with respect to the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless such party consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

   

(d)Antitrust Matters.

 

(i)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 7.02,
each of Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to
take or cause to be taken the following actions until the earlier to occur of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms:

 

(A)as soon as practicable, and in any event with respect to the Filing under
the HSR Act, no later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, to file (1) the initial pre-merger notifications with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein required under the HSR
Act (which filing, including the exhibits thereto, shall not be shared or
otherwise disclosed to the other parties, except for providing copies of Item
4 documents to outside counsel of each party, with any redactions as permitted
by this Section 7.02) for Seller and Purchaser, in each case, requesting early
termination of the waiting period with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and (2) any notification or other form necessary to obtain
any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any
other Antitrust Law; provided, however, it is agreed and acknowledged that
Purchaser shall pay the filing fee required in connection with the Filing
under the HSR Act;

 

(B)to promptly provide to each Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over
enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law (a "Governmental Antitrust
Entity") non-privileged information and documents requested by any such
Governmental Antitrust Entity in connection with obtaining any such consent,
clearance, approval, or authorization of such Governmental Antitrust Entity
that is necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

(C)to use reasonable best efforts to take, and to cause each of its
subsidiaries to take, any and all actions necessary to obtain any Consents or
clearances required under or in connection with any Antitrust Law and enable
all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire and Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Law asserted by any Governmental Entity, in each case, to enable
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur prior to the
Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date, as applicable, including
using reasonable best efforts to comply with, and modifying where appropriate,
any requests for additional information by any Governmental Entity.

 

(ii)Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.02(d) or
otherwise in this Agreement shall require Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries
to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any divestiture, or take any other action that, in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser, could be expected to limit the right of
Purchaser or any its subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of
their respective businesses or assets (including the Company following the
Closing) or otherwise receive the full benefits of the Acquisition or the
Marketing Partnership Agreement.

   

(iii)Nothing in this Section 7.02(d) shall require Seller or its Affiliates or
Purchaser or its Affiliates to take or agree to take any action with respect
to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 

(iv)Seller and its Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, publicly or before any Governmental Entity or other third party,
offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall not commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any sale, license,
assignment, transfer, divestiture, hold separate or other disposition of any
assets, business or portion of business, or the imposition of any restriction,
requirement or limitation on the operation of any business or assets.

 

Section 7.03.Notification of Certain Matters. From the date hereof until the
earlier to occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly notify each
other of (i) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with any Proceeding or investigation commenced or, to the knowledge
of Purchaser or to the knowledge of Seller, as applicable, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting a party which relates to this
Agreement or the Other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereunder or thereunder or (ii) to the knowledge of Purchaser or to the
knowledge of Seller, any change, condition or event that (A) renders or would
reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such party
(including, with respect to Seller, the Company) set forth in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate to an extent such that the conditions set forth in
Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, as applicable, would not be satisfied if the
Closing were to then occur or (B) results or would reasonably be expected to
result in any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be completed with or satisfied
by such party; provided, that no such notification, nor any failure to make
such notification, shall affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
parties.

 

Section 7.04.Tax Matters.

 

(a)The amount of any Tax refunds or credits in lieu of cash Tax refunds with
respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (net of any Taxes
incurred in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refunds and any other
expenses attributable to obtaining and receiving such refunds or credits)
shall be for the account of Seller, other than any refund or credit that was
reflected as an asset in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital
pursuant to Section 2.02. Purchaser shall forward, or cause to be forwarded,
to Seller the amount of such refund or credit within ten (10) days after such
refund is received or after such credit is applied against another Tax, as the
case may be. To the extent any such refund or credit is subsequently
disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Taxing Authority,
Seller agrees to promptly repay the amount of such refund or credit, together
with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such
Taxing Authority, to Purchaser. For the purposes of this Section 7.04(a),
where it is necessary to apportion the economic benefit of a refund or credit
for Taxes for a Straddle Period, such benefit shall be apportioned between
Seller and Purchaser using the principles of Section 7.04(b). If requested by
Seller, Purchaser shall take all reasonable action necessary to promptly
claim, at the sole cost and expense of Seller, such Tax refunds or credits in
lieu of cash Tax refunds to the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

   

(b)In the case of any Straddle Period: (i) real, personal and intangible
property Taxes or other similar ad valorem Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
("Periodic Taxes") for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount
of such Periodic Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (disregarding any
increase or decrease in Tax for such period as a result of the Acquisition)
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) Taxes (other
than Periodic Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed on a
closing of the books basis as if such taxable period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

 

(c)All Transfer Taxes (including any Transfer Taxes attributable to the Asset
Transfer) shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Purchaser. Notwithstanding
this Section 7.04(c), Purchaser and Seller agree that any Tax Returns that
must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed
when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible under the
applicable Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party
prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.

 

(d)(i) Seller (or its Affiliates) shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all
Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date (all such Tax Returns, "Seller Prepared Tax Returns") in a manner
consistent with past practice of the Company, except as required by applicable
Law. Seller (or its Affiliates) shall timely file such Seller Prepared Tax
Returns and shall pay the Taxes shown as due with respect thereto (except to
the extent such Taxes are (A) treated as a liability for purposes of
calculating the Final Purchase Price or (B) attributable to actions taken by
Purchaser or the Company after the Closing on the Closing Date outside the
ordinary course of business, which Taxes shall be paid by Purchaser). Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser a draft of each such Seller Prepared Tax Return at
least twenty (20) days before the date such Seller Prepared Tax Return is
required to be filed; provided, that in the case Purchaser delivers to Seller
within ten (10) days after receiving such Seller Prepared Tax Return a written
statement describing its objections (if any) thereto, Seller shall consider
any reasonable objections in good faith; provided, further, that Seller is
only required to provide Purchaser with information relating to the Company
and shall not provide any Tax Returns of the Seller Tax Group or provide any
information of any member of the Seller Tax Group (other than the Company).
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith in determining whether to
file single combined IRS Forms 1099 for Company transactions for the entire
calendar year 2017. 

 

(ii)Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the
Company with respect to a Straddle Period that are due after the Closing Date
other than a Tax Return with respect to a Seller Tax Group of which the
Company is a member ("Purchaser Prepared Tax Returns"). Purchaser shall
prepare such Purchaser Prepared Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practice of the Company, except to the extent such past practice is not more
likely than not to be upheld under applicable Law and shall deliver to Seller
a draft of each such Purchaser Prepared Tax Return at least twenty (20) days
before the date such Purchaser Prepared Tax Return is required to be filed;
provided, that in the case Seller provides to Purchaser within ten (10) days
after receiving such Purchaser Prepared Tax Return a written statement
describing all of its objections (if any) thereto, Purchaser shall consider
any reasonable objections in good faith. Purchaser shall cause the Company to
execute and timely file, as

   

prepared, all Purchaser Prepared Tax Returns. At least two (2) days before
payment of Taxes (including estimated Taxes) is due to the applicable Taxing
Authority with respect to the Purchaser Prepared Tax Returns, Seller shall pay
Purchaser for any Taxes shown as due on any such Purchaser Prepared Tax Return
that is filed by Purchaser to the extent such Taxes are the responsibility of
Seller (as determined in accordance with Section 10.01).

 

(iii)Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to reasonably cooperate (including
by providing any necessary powers of attorney), in preparing and filing all
Tax Returns described in this Section 7.04(d) (subject to this Section
7.04(d)), and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to Taxes and
in other matters relating to Taxes for which the applicable statute of
limitations has not expired, including by maintaining and making available to
each other, as reasonably necessary, records with respect to such Taxes.
Seller shall be entitled to (1) continue discussions and negotiations of the
matters set forth on Section 7.04(d)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
and (2) continue to conduct and control, through counsel of Seller's choosing
and at Seller's sole cost and expense, the resolution of such matters and
shall be permitted to settle or compromise such tax matters upon Purchaser's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed except to the extent such settlement and/or compromise imposes
monetary obligations on Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Company and/or
involving injunctive or equitable relief applicable to Purchaser, its
Affiliates or the Company, in which case such consent may be withheld or
granted in Purchaser's sole discretion). Purchaser shall have the right to
participate at its own cost and expense in such matters.

 

(e)Except (x) upon the prior written consent of Seller or (y) to the extent an
applicable Tax position (including an interpretation of whether an action is
required under applicable Law) (1) is not "more likely than not" supportable
under applicable Law and with respect to Specified Pre-Closing Taxes it is
probable that a liability has been incurred under applicable ASC Guidelines so
that the item must be accrued as a liability on the financial statements of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company), and (2) is
inconsistent with a Tax or financial reporting position (including any such
interpretation of whether an action is required under applicable Law) taken by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in a similar situation with respect to the
same Law or financial reporting guidelines, none of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company) shall (i) amend any Tax Return for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (ii) make any Tax election regarding the Company with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) surrender any right to claim a
refund for Taxes of the Company of which Seller is entitled to receive payment
thereof, (iv) file any Tax Return of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period in any jurisdiction if the Company did not file a comparable Tax
Return involving similar Tax items in such jurisdiction in the immediately
preceding Tax period, or (v) initiate any discussion or enter into any
voluntary disclosure program (or similar program or agreement) with a
Governmental Entity regarding any Tax (whether asserted or unasserted) or Tax
Return with respect to the Company relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in
each case if such action could affect the Taxes of Seller or result in any
indemnity claim against Seller under this Agreement. In the event Purchaser
and Seller are unable to agree as to whether an applicable Tax position is
"more likely than not" supportable under applicable Law (and with respect to
Specified Pre-Closing Taxes is required to be accrued as a liability on the
financial statements), or whether an applicable Tax position is inconsistent
with a Tax or financial

   

reporting position taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in a similar
situation with respect to the same Law or financial reporting guidelines,
Purchaser and Seller shall submit such matter to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, in accordance with the procedural principles of Section 2.02(c).

 

Section 7.05.Employee Matters.

 

(a)As soon as practicable following the parties' execution of this Agreement
(but in no event later than fifteen (15)] Business Days thereafter), Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its Affiliate (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company) to, extend offers of employment effective as of the Closing to
the active Business Employees set forth on Section 7.05(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. Each such offer of employment shall be on terms
determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion; provided, however, if any
active Business Employee receives an offer of employment providing for (i) an
initial base salary or wage rate that is not substantially comparable to the
base salary or wage rate provided to such Business Employee immediately prior
to the Closing and (ii) providing for an initial opportunity to earn a long-
term incentive award with a target amount that is not substantially comparable
to the target long-term incentive award provided by Seller immediately prior
to the date hereof, such Business Employee shall be deemed not to have
received an offer of employment pursuant to this Section 7.05(a) for purposes
of determining satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in Section
8.01(f). Each active Business Employee who accepts employment with Purchaser
or its Affiliate as of the Closing shall be referred to herein as "Transferred
Employees."

 

(b)Effective as of the Closing, the Transferred Employees shall cease active
participation in the Benefit Plans except as provided by the terms of any such
Benefit Plan or applicable Law. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, Seller shall remain liable for all eligible claims for benefits and
claims under the Benefit Plans that are incurred by the Transferred Employees
(regardless of when such claims are reported or disclosed). Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, any Business Employee (i) who as of the
Closing Date is short-term disabled or receiving or entitled to receive short-
term disability under a Benefit Plan and who subsequently becomes eligible to
receive long-term disability benefits, or (ii) as of the Closing Date is
receiving or entitled to receive long-term disability benefits, shall become
eligible or continue to be eligible, as applicable, to receive short-term
and/or long-term disability benefits as applicable under a short-term and/or
long-term disability plan maintained by Seller. Seller shall be solely
responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

 

(c)On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall pay to each Transferred Employee
all amounts in respect of vacation and other paid time off earned but not
taken by such Transferred Employee through the Closing; provided, however,
Purchaser shall have no commitment, Liability or obligation for, and Seller
and its Affiliates shall hold Purchaser harmless with respect to, all such
amounts payable to any Transferred Employee; provided further, Purchaser shall
have no obligation to honor after the Closing any vacation or other paid time
off earned by any Transferred Employee prior to the Closing. After the
Closing, each Transferred Employee's eligibility for vacation and other paid
time off shall be determined under Purchaser's policies.

   

(d)This Section 7.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.05,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever (including any third-party beneficiary rights) under
or by reason of this Section 7.05. Nothing contained in this Section 7.05,
express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or
arrangement or to limit the ability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
Contract, agreement or arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the terms set forth in this Section 7.05 shall not create any right in
any Transferred Employee or any other person to any employment or service or
continued employment or service or any term or condition of employment or
service with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever, or limit the ability of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to terminate the employment or service of any person at any time
and for any or no reason.

 

Section 7.06.Intercompany Arrangements; Termination of Contracts.

 

(a)Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that except as
otherwise provided in any Other Transaction Document and except as set forth
on Section 7.06 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, upon the Closing, all
Contracts or other arrangements (including intercompany balances) between
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, that were entered into prior to the Closing
will be canceled, terminated or extinguished, as the case may be, without
payment or Liability.

 

(b)Seller will terminate or cause to be terminated (i) on or prior to the
Closing Date, each of the Contracts listed in Section 7.06(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and (ii) as of the day prior to the Closing Date, any Tax
sharing or similar agreement between the Company and any other party and all
powers of attorney relating to Tax matters of the Company (the Contracts
referred to in (i) and (ii), the "Terminated Contracts"). Following the
termination of the Terminated Contracts in accordance with this Section 7.06,
no such Contract shall have further force or effect for any past or future
taxable period.

 

Section 7.07.Replacement of Credit Support. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange for
replacement arrangements, effective as of the Closing, for all guarantees,
covenants, indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, comfort letters or
similar assurances of credit support provided by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company) for the benefit of the Company or the
Business that are in existence as of the Closing set forth on Section 3.20 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain releases indicating that Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Company) have no liability with respect thereto, in each case,
reasonably satisfactory to Seller. If any of the foregoing guarantees,
covenants, indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, comfort letters or
similar assurances of credit support have not been released as of the Closing
Date, Seller and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
after the Closing Date to cause any of the foregoing to be released; provided,
that, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company) from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by
them after the Closing Date in respect to the

   

Company in connection with any of the foregoing guarantees, covenants,
indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, comfort letters or similar
assurances of credit support. The foregoing shall not require Purchaser to
assume any liability or incur expense in connection with exercising such
reasonable best efforts that Purchaser is not otherwise obligated to assume or
incur hereunder.

 

Section 7.08.Cooperation Regarding Contract Consents. Prior to, on and
following the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser agree to (a) use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other party, (b) take all
reasonable actions within its control reasonably requested by the other party,
in each case, in order to obtain the Required Consents and the consents set
forth on Section 7.08(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Material
Consents") and (c) take all reasonable actions within its control to complete
the tasks set forth on Section 7.08(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. If
despite a party's reasonable best efforts, the parties are not able to obtain
a Required Consent or Material Consent from one or more of such third persons,
Purchaser and Seller shall work together in good faith to determine a
reasonable alternative arrangement for the Company to receive the benefit of
such underlying Contract(s) at no material incremental cost to Purchaser or
its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company). All such
Required Consents or Material Consents shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and shall be made available to Purchaser
following execution thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 7.08 nor any alternative arrangements entered into pursuant to the
foregoing sentence shall be deemed to satisfy the condition set forth in
Section 8.01(d), which may only be waived by Purchaser in its sole discretion.

 

Section 7.09.Post-Closing Cooperation.

 

(a)Access to Records. After the Closing, except as prohibited by applicable
Law, upon reasonable advance written notice, each of Seller and Purchaser
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their respective
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to such
information, Records (including furnishing copies thereof) and assistance
(including access to personnel) relating to the conduct of the Business and
the Company prior to the Effective Time (to the extent within the control of
such party) as is reasonably necessary (i) for financial reporting and
accounting matters, (ii) to facilitate the investigation, litigation,
settlement and final disposition of any claims that may have been or may be
made by or against Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or
(iii) in connection with any investigation by any Governmental Entity.
Purchaser and Seller each shall reimburse the other party for reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other
party or their respective Affiliates pursuant to this Section 7.09. Neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall be required by this Section 7.09 to take any action
that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its or its Affiliates'
business or unreasonably disrupt its or its Affiliates' normal operations.

 

(b)Retention to Records. Each of Seller, Purchaser and the Company agrees
that, for a period of not less than seven (7) years following the Closing Date
(or such longer period as may be required by applicable Law), it shall not
destroy or otherwise dispose, or permit the destruction or disposal, of any of
the Records relating to the Business in existence on the Closing Date in its
or its Affiliates' possession. Each of Seller, Purchaser and the Company
shall

   

have the right to destroy all or part of such Records after the seventh (7th)
anniversary of the Closing Date by giving the other party twenty (20) Business
Days' prior written notice of such intended disposition and by offering to
deliver to such other party, at such other party's expense, custody of such
Records as it intends to destroy.

 

(c)Misallocation of Records. In the event that, at or after the Closing, (i)
any Records relating to the Company or the Business is in or comes into the
possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates, Seller shall promptly deliver
such document or information to Purchaser or (ii) any Records relating to any
Seller Subsidiary or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than
the Company or with respect to the Business), is in or comes into the
possession of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, Purchaser shall promptly
deliver such document or information to Seller.

 

(d)Misallocation of Assets. If, following Closing, either party discovers that
the Company owns any right, property, asset or Liability that was not a
Transferred Asset or constituted an Excluded Liability, then any such right,
property, asset or Liability shall be deemed to have been held in trust by the
Company following Closing for Seller or its applicable Affiliate, and the
Company shall promptly transfer, assign and convey such right, property, asset
or Liability to Seller (or any of its Affiliates as designated by Seller)
without any consideration therefor. If, following Closing, any party discovers
that any Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability was not transferred to the
Company as part of the consummation of the Asset Transfer or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then any such right, property,
asset or Liability shall be deemed to have been held in trust by Seller or its
applicable Affiliate following Closing for the Company, and Seller shall or
shall cause its Affiliate to promptly transfer, assign and convey such
Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability, as applicable, to the Company (or any
of its Affiliates as designated by the Company or Purchaser) without
additional consideration therefor.

 

(e)Payments. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly pay or
deliver to the Company any monies or checks which have been sent to Seller or
such Affiliates after the Closing Date by restaurants, corporate clients,
suppliers or other contracting parties of the Company in respect of the
Transferred Assets or the Business or to the extent such monies or checks
should have otherwise been sent to the Company or paid for the benefit of the
Business. The Company shall promptly pay or deliver to Seller or its designees
any monies or checks that have been sent to the Company after the Closing Date
by restaurants, corporate clients, suppliers or other contracting parties, to
the extent such monies or checks should have otherwise been sent to Seller or
its Affiliates. If, at any time after the Closing, an invoice, bill, purchase
order or other similar documentation in respect of assets or services provided
by or to the Business from any restaurant, corporate client, supplier or other
contracting party of the Company is received by Seller or its Affiliates and
Seller or such Affiliate actually pays any amount with respect thereto, upon
receipt of written notice and reasonable supporting documentation from Seller,
the Company shall promptly reimburse Seller or such Affiliate for any and all
such amounts actually paid by Seller or such Affiliate. If, at any time after
the Closing, an invoice, bill, purchase order or other similar documentation
in respect of assets or services provided by or to the business operated by
Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing from any restaurant, corporate
client, supplier or other contracting party of Seller or its Affiliates is
received by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company) and Purchaser
or such Affiliate actually pays any amount

   

with respect thereto, upon receipt of written notice and reasonable supporting
documentation from Purchaser, Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser or
such Affiliate for any and all such amounts actually paid by Purchaser or such
Affiliate.

 

(f)Further Assurances. From time to time at or after the Closing Date, at the
request of the other, Seller and Purchaser each will execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, such other instruments of conveyance,
assignment, transfer and delivery and take such actions as the other parties
reasonably may request in order to consummate, complete and carry out the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g)Specified Matters. Seller shall be entitled to (i) continue discussions and
negotiations of the matters set forth on Section 7.09(g) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the "Specified Matters") and (ii) continue to conduct and
control, through counsel of Seller's choosing and at Seller's sole cost and
expense, the resolution of such matters and shall be permitted to engage in
any administrative activities necessary to finalize the Specified Matters in
accordance with the applicable parties' settlement agreement; provided,
however, any settlement or compromise of such Specified Matters that varies
from the settlement agreements previously made available to Parent relating to
such Specified Matters shall require Purchaser's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed except to the extent
such settlement and/or compromise imposes monetary obligations on Purchaser,
its Affiliates or the Company and/or involves injunctive or equitable relief
applicable to Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Company, in which case such
consent may be withheld or granted in Purchaser's sole discretion). Purchaser
shall have the right to participate in the conduct of the settlement or
compromise of the Specified Matters at its own cost and expense in such
matters. Seller shall, in connection with the Specified Matters, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) keep Purchaser reasonably informed with respect
to the status thereof, including, by promptly providing Purchaser copies of
all substantive written correspondence relating to any Specified Matter and
(ii) promptly notify Purchaser of any substantive communication received by
the Company from a Governmental Entity with respect to any Specified Matter.

which breach would reasonably be expected to result in the failure to satisfy
any condition set forth in Section 8.02, and any such breach shall be
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been

Antitrust Law), Section 8.01(c), Section 8.02(b) (solely if the Law or

covenant or agreement hereunder will have been the principal cause of, or will
have directly resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date, as the case may be; or

 

(e)Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the other party, if any Law or

relief) of Seller and its Affiliates (including the Company and any other
person) against Purchaser and its Affiliates for any Losses suffered
hereunder, under the Other Transaction Documents or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder. Except as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Article IX shall
be deemed to release either Seller or Purchaser from any Liability for any

policies; provided, that that the foregoing shall not be deemed to require any

Affiliates, any restaurant or corporate client with which it has an ongoing
business relationship).

 

(b)Each of Purchaser and Seller shall, to the extent required by applicable
Law, act in a commercially reasonable manner to mitigate any Losses they may
pay, incur, suffer or sustain for which indemnification is available
hereunder. 

 

(c)Each of Purchaser and Seller further acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing, its and its Affiliates' sole and exclusive monetary remedy

of their respective Affiliates arising under or based upon this Agreement, the
Acquisition or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 10.03(c) shall impair the
right of either party to compel specific performance by the other party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

immediately available funds from the indemnifying party to an account
designated in writing by the indemnified party within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of such Loss in accordance with Section 10.06 or
Section 10.07, as applicable. With respect to any payment pursuant to this
Section 10.03(d) which is to be satisfied from the Escrow Fund (as described
in Section 10.01(c) above), Purchaser and Seller shall promptly execute the
necessary documents instructing the Escrow Agent to make the applicable
payments. On the Business Day immediately following the Release Date, the
balance of the Escrow Fund, less the aggregate amount, if any, which any
Purchaser Indemnitees has claimed under this Section 10.03(d) prior to such
date (to the extent of Losses subject to such claims, if any, remain
unresolved and in the case of Specified Pre-Closing Taxes only to the extent
(i) such claims are the subject of any audit, investigation, assessment, or
proposed deficiency by a Taxing Authority or (ii) Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliates would be permitted to take any actions contemplated by Section
7.04(e)(iv) or Section 7.04(e)(v) with respect to such claims) (such

Purchaser and Seller shall promptly execute the

   

necessary documents instructing the Escrow Agent to make the applicable
payment of the Unclaimed Remaining Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Seller. Upon final resolution of all such
previously unresolved claims in accordance with Section 10.06 and Section
10.07 and after payments related to such claims are made, the balance of the
Escrow Fund, if any (the "Final Remaining Escrow Amount"), shall be
distributed, and Purchaser and Seller shall promptly execute the necessary
documents instructing the Escrow Agent to make the applicable payment of the
Final Remaining Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to Seller.

 

Section 10.04.Calculation of Losses. For the purposes of the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article X, any Losses or amounts otherwise
payable hereunder shall be determined on the basis of the net effect after
giving effect to any cash payments, setoffs, recoupment or other payments, in
each case, actually received, realized or retained by the indemnified party
(including any amounts recovered by the indemnified party under insurance
policies) as a result of any event giving rise to a claim for such
indemnification; provided, however, that the fact that any amounts described
in this Section 10.04 may be available to an indemnified party but have not
yet been actually received shall not restrict or limit such indemnified
party's ability to recover any Losses pursuant to this Article X (subject to
the indemnified party's obligation to reimburse any portion of indemnified
Losses for which insurance recovery has actually been received so as to ensure
no double recovery).

 

Section 10.05.Termination of Indemnification.

 

(a)The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to
(i) Sections 10.01(a)(i) and 10.02(a)(i), as each relates to breaches of
representations and warranties, shall terminate when the applicable
representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 10.05(b), (ii)
Section 10.01(a)(ii) and Section 10.02(a)(ii), shall terminate at the close of
business on the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, that
with respect to covenants requiring performance after Closing which extend
beyond the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing, such covenants shall
terminate in accordance with their respective terms, (iii) Section
10.01(a)(iii) shall terminate at the close of business on the tenth (10th)
anniversary of the Closing Date and (iv) Section 10.01(a)(v) shall terminate
at the close of business on the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, that, as to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) of this sentence,
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified or a related
party thereto, or any person on behalf of such indemnified person or related
party, shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously
made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable
detail the basis of such claim) to the indemnifying party.

 

(b)The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing solely for purposes of Sections 10.01 and 10.02 and shall
terminate at the close of business on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "Release Date"); provided, that the Seller Fundamental
Representations and the Seller Release Representations shall terminate on the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

   

Section 10.06.Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

 

(a)In order for a person (the "indemnified party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim or demand made by any person that is not party, or an
Affiliate of a party, to this Agreement against such indemnified party (a
"Third Party Claim"), such indemnified party must notify the party responsible
for such indemnification under this Agreement (the "indemnifying party") of
the Third Party Claim in writing, and in reasonable detail, within twenty (20)
Business Days after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the
Third Party Claim, which notice shall refer to the provision of this Agreement
upon which such claim is based, and describe in reasonable detail (to the
extent known) the facts giving rise to such claim and the amount of Losses
asserted against the indemnifying party relating to such claim; provided, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except and only to the extent the indemnifying party shall
have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, such
indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly after such
indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by such indemnified party relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 

(b)If a Third Party Claim is made against any indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof at
its sole cost and expense and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel selected by the indemnifying party; provided, that such counsel
is not reasonably objected to by such indemnified party. Should the
indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to any indemnified party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, each
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel (not to be unreasonably objected to by the indemnifying
party), at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by any indemnified party for
any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense of
a Third Party Claim.

 

(c)If the indemnifying party so elects to defend or prosecute any Third Party
Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the indemnifying
party in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the
indemnifying party of Records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party
reasonably informed (including by timely providing copies of all written
correspondence) regarding the status of any Third Party Claim and may not
consent to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless such settlement obligates the

Liability which it may have to such indemnified party under Section 10.01 or

been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. If such indemnifying
party disputes its Liability with respect to such claim, such indemnifying

dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent

to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as

Section 11.07.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile, email or other electronic imaging means shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Minor
variations in the form of the signature page to this Agreement, including
footers from earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document,
will be disregarded in determining the effectiveness of such signature. At
the request of any party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each
other party hereto or thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and
deliver them to all other parties hereto. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument will raise the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an electronic
transmission in PDF as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

 

Section 11.08.Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

 

Section 11.09.Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any
applicable Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 11.10.Specific Performance; Limitation on Liability. The parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the
parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the immediately following
sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree

   

that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article IX, (i) the parties shall be entitled to an Injunction or Injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in Section 11.11 without proof of damages or otherwise, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement or at Law or in equity, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section
9.03 (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm
that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party's right to
specific performance and (iii) the right of specific performance is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither Seller nor Purchaser would have entered into this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an Injunction or Injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other party hereto have an adequate
remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at Law or in equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that any party seeking an Injunction or Injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 11.10 shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Injunction or
Injunctions.

 

Section 11.11.Consent to Jurisdiction. Except with respect to any Proceeding
brought by Purchaser or the Company regarding or related to the enforcement of
any provision of Section 5.06, each party hereto hereby (i) agrees that any
Proceeding, directly or indirectly, arising out of, under or relating to this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, will be heard and determined in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware (and each agrees that no such Proceeding
relating to this Agreement will be brought by it or any of its Affiliates
except in such court), subject to any appeal, provided, that if jurisdiction
is not then available in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, then any
such Proceeding may be brought in any Delaware state court or any federal
court located in the State of Delaware and (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any
such Proceeding. Each party hereto (A) irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in any court referred to in
the first sentence of this Section 11.11, (B) irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum
and (C) agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding brought in any
such court shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 11.12.Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER

   

PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 11.12.

 

Section 11.13.GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS
OF LAWS THEREOF.

 

Section 11.14.Parent Guaranty. Subject to the provisions of this Section
11.14, Parent hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
Seller (i) the due and punctual payment of the Closing Date Purchase Price,
any adjustment to the Closing Date Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.02(d),
any indemnification obligations of Purchaser pursuant to Article X, and any
other monetary obligations of Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and (ii) the performance of all other obligations to be performed by
Purchaser. Parent hereby acknowledges that, with respect to all of Purchaser's
obligations, this guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and not of
collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of any
remedies against Purchaser. Parent acknowledges that it will receive direct
and indirect benefits from the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that the guaranties set forth in this Section 11.14 are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
