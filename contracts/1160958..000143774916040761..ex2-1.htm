2.7 _Target Stock Options_.

 



 

(a) The Target shall take such action as shall be required so that, no
later than later than eight (8) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the
holder of each Target Option that is vested (after giving effect to any
vesting acceleration occurring at the Effective Time by nature of the
transactions contemplated herein), unexpired, unexercised and then outstanding
shall be notified of his or her opportunity to exercise such Target Option
prior to the Effective Time and participate in the Merger as a Stockholder. At
the Effective Time, each Vested Target Option that (i) is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) has a per share exercise price less than the Common Per Share Amount (an
"Eligible Vested Target Option"), shall, subject to the other conditions set
forth in this Agreement, be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, Target, the holder of the Eligible Vested
Target Option or any other Person, cancelled, and each holder of an Eligible
Vested Target Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other
than, subject to the execution and delivery to Acquiror of an Option
Acknowledgement by the Closing Option Acknowledgement Deadline for those
Persons listed on _Schedule_ _7.27.2(z)_ , and for all other holders of Vested
Target Options, the date that is the earlier of (A) twenty (20) Business Days
following the Closing Date and (B) December 23rd of the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs (such date, the "Second Option Acknowledgement
Deadline"), the right to receive on the terms of the Option Acknowledgment,
subject to applicable withholding, (A) an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Target Capital

excess of the Common Per Share Amount over the per share exercise price under
such Eligible Vested Target Options, and (B) any amounts that may become
payable in respect of such Eligible Vested Target Options in the future from
the Escrow Consideration or Expense Fund Amount in accordance with _Section _
_9_ , if, as and when such release is required to be made as provided in this
Agreement. For holders of Eligible Vested Target Options who are subject to
United States taxes, for the purposes of reporting compensation income and
calculating the applicable income and employment tax withholding with respect

the Option Acknowledgements, the applicable information reporting and the
timing and amounts subject to income and employment tax withholding shall be
based upon the amounts actually received by the holders of such Eligible
Vested Target Options. For holders who are not subject to United States taxes,
the immediately preceding sentence applies, except to the extent otherwise
required by applicable Law. The amounts in (A)-(B) above, the "Option Cash-out
Payment". After the Effective Time, the holder of each Eligible Vested Target
Option shall only be entitled to the Option Cash-Out Payment with respect to
such Vested Target Option. For the sake of clarity, a Vested Target Option
that has a per share exercise price equal to or in excess of the Common Per
Share Amount, or is held by a Person who does not timely execute and deliver
an Option Acknowledgement by the Second Option Acknowledgement Deadline, shall
be canceled without any consideration.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, all Target Options other than Eligible Vested
Target Options shall be cancelled and extinguished without any consideration,

(c) The holders of all outstanding Vested Target Options with per share
exercise prices less than the Common Per Share Amount shall have executed and
delivered to Acquiror, an acknowledgement, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ (an "Option Acknowledgement"), accepting the consideration
provided in _Section_ _2.7(a)_ in lieu of any other consideration that might
be claimed by any such holder, unconditionally and irrevocably waiving and
releasing all right or claim that such holder might have or assert in respect
of such consideration (other than the right to receive the Option Cash-out
Payment), and acknowledging that the Vested Target Options shall terminate
upon and may not be exercised after the Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

2.8 _Target Warrants._

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Target Warrant that (i) is unexpired,

set forth in this Agreement, be, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, Target, the holder of the Eligible
Target Warrant or any other Person, cancelled, and each holder of an Eligible
Target Warrant shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than
the right to receive, (A) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Target Capital Stock subject
to such Target Warrant multiplied by (2) the excess of the Common Per Share
Amount, Series A Per Share Amount or Series B-1 Per Share Amount, as
applicable, payable with respect to the class or series of Target Capital
Stock underlying the Eligible Target Warrant over the per share exercise price
of such Eligible Target Warrant, and (B) any amounts that may become payable
in respect of such Eligible Target Warrant in the future from the Escrow
Consideration or Expense Fund Amount in accordance with _Section _ _9_ , if,
as and when such release is required to be made. The amounts in (A)-(B) above,
the "Warrant Cash-out Payment". After the Effective Time, the holder of each
Eligible Target Warrant shall only be entitled to the Warrant Cash-Out Payment
with respect to such Eligible Target Warrants. For the sake of clarity, a
Target Warrant with an exercise price equal to or in excess of, for Target
Warrants exercisable for Target Common Stock, the Common Per Share Amount, for
Target Warrants exercisable for Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Per
Share Amount or, for Target Warrants exercisable for Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, the Series B-1 Per Share Amount, or that is held by a Person who does
not timely execute and deliver a Warrant Acknowledgement as set forth herein,
shall be canceled without any consideration.

 



 

(b) The holders of all outstanding Target Warrants with an exercise price
less than, for Target Warrants exercisable for Target Common Stock, the Common
Per Share Amount, for Target Warrants exercisable for Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series A Per Share Amount or, for Target Warrants exercisable for
Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Per Share Amount shall have
executed and delivered to Acquiror, an acknowledgement in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit F_ (a "Warrant Acknowledgement"), accepting the
consideration provided by this _Section_ _2.8(a)_ in lieu of any other
consideration that might be claimed by any such holder, unconditionally and
irrevocably waiving and releasing all right or claim that such holder might
have or assert in respect of such consideration other than the right to
receive the Warrant Cash-out Payment, and acknowledging that the Target
Warrants shall terminate upon and may not be exercised after the Closing Date.

 



 

2.9 _Dissenters ' Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Target Capital Stock held by a holder
who has demanded and perfected such holder's right for appraisal of such
shares in accordance with Delaware Law or, to the extent applicable, Chapter
13 of the CCC and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn
or lost such right to appraisal ("Dissenting Shares"), if any, shall not be
converted into the Merger Consideration but shall instead be converted into
the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Delaware Law or, as applicable,
Chapter 13 of the CCC, if any. Target shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any
demand received by Target to require Target to purchase shares of Target
Capital Stock, and Acquiror shall have the right to direct and participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. Target agrees
that, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, or as required under
Delaware Law or, as applicable, Chapter 13 of the CCC, it will not voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
purchase demand. Each holder of Dissenting Shares ("Dissenting Stockholder")
who, pursuant to the provisions of Delaware Law or, as applicable, Chapter 13
of the CCC, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value for shares of Target
Capital Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value
therefore shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such
provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose
their status as Dissenting Shares, Acquiror shall issue and deliver, upon
surrender by such stockholder of a certificate or certificates representing
shares of Target Capital Stock, the portion of the Merger Consideration to
which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled under this _Section _
_2.9_ and the Certificate of Merger.

of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration that
such holder is eligible to receive pursuant to _Section _ _2.6_ and _Section_

entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section _ _2.6_ hereof.

 



 

2.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Target Capital Stock_. The Merger

Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Target
Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the

to reasonable review and approval by Acquiror. Target also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plans as Acquiror may

other fees then Target shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees, and provide such estimate in
writing to Acquiror no later than five (5) calendar days prior to the Closing

and for the twelve month period following the Closing Date, Acquiror agrees to
provide or cause its applicable Subsidiary to provide (i) each Continuing
Employee with a base salary or standard hourly wage rate and target bonus
amount, that is no less than his or her base salary or standard hourly wage
rate, and target bonus amount, as in effect on the Effective Time and (ii) the
Continuing Employees with employee benefits, plans, programs and arrangements
(excluding change in control, severance, defined benefit and equity and
equity-based benefits) that are in the aggregate substantially similar to the
benefits (excluding change in control, severance, defined benefit and equity
and equity-based benefits) provided to such employees of Target and its
Subsidiaries on the date hereof. In determining substantial similarity in the
aggregate each type of benefit plan provided to Continuing Employees shall be
compared to one similar type of benefit plan offered by Target or its
Subsidiaries without regard to the fact that Target may offer additional plans
of the same general type. Substantial similarity in the aggregate shall be
determined without considering Continuing Employee contributions to the
premiums for health insurance benefits provided that such contributions are no
greater than the contributions made by other similarly situated employees of
Acquirer.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(f) With respect to the Acquiror Benefit Plans, to the extent made
available to Continuing Employees and to the extent permitted under such
Acquiror Benefit Plans and under Applicable Law, credit for service accrued by
Continuing Employees (and eligible dependents) for employment with Target
prior to the Effective Time shall be recognized for purposes of eligibility
and vesting (but not with respect to the accrual of any benefits or to the
extent necessary to prevent duplication of benefits).

 



 

(g) Within forty (40) days following the Closing Date, as an inducement to
their employment with Acquiror, certain Continuing Employees will be awarded
Acquiror RSUs representing an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Acquiror Stock
by the compensation committee of Acquiror's board of directors, which Acquiror
RSUs shall be allocated among the Continuing Employees as determined by
Acquiror and Target's Chief Executive Officer. Such Acquiror RSUs will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in a restricted stock
unit agreement to be entered into between each recipient of such Acquiror RSUs
and Acquiror, including vesting over four years of service beginning at the
Effective Time or milestone based vesting for a limited number of Key
Employees on terms that are in accordance with Acquiror's standard forms for
RSUs, and including a valid and enforceable general release and waiver of
claims in favor of Target, Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates. Acquiror will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Acquiror Stock issuable upon settlement of the Acquiror RSUs to be registered
with the SEC on Form S-8 no later than forty (40) days following the Closing
Date, will use exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Acquiror RSUs
remain outstanding and will reserve a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror
Stock for issuance upon settlement thereof.

 



 

(h) Nothing in this _Section _ _6.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, modifying or
terminating any benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement, or be
construed to create a right in any employee of Target or Acquiror to
employment with Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, Target or any other
Subsidiary of Acquiror or Target subject to the requirements of Applicable Law
and, subject to any other binding written agreement between an employee and
Acquiror, the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Continuing Employee or other
employee of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, will be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this
_Section _ _6.7_ or any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(i) _Section 280G Matters_.

 



 

(i) Target will obtain and deliver to Acquiror, prior to the initiation of
the procedure described in ☒subsection (ii) of this _Section _ _6.7(i)_ , an
excess parachute payment waiver, in the form previously approved by Acquiror,
from each Person who Target and Acquiror reasonably agree is, with respect to
Target or any of its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates, a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and who would
otherwise receive or have the right or entitlement to receive or retain a
"parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) from Target
or any of its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates , or from Acquiror or any
trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is a member of a
controlled group or which is under common control with Acquiror within the
meaning of Section 414 of the Code, under Section 280G of the Code in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including in
connection with certain changes in any such Person's employment circumstances
following the consummation of the Merger). By the execution of such waiver
agreement, the Person executing the waiver will agree to waive all of his or
her right and entitlement to receive (or if already paid, his or her right and
entitlement to keep) any portion of such "parachute payments" which would
cause the Person executing the waiver to receive an "excess parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), unless Target's stockholders
approve such waived payments in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of
the Code.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Target will submit the payments which are waived pursuant to the
waiver agreements described in ☒subsection (i) of this _Section _ _6.7(i)_ to
its stockholders and the holders of the voting power of any entity stockholder
for their approval in accordance with all applicable requirements of such
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations.

 



 

6.8 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Transaction
Expenses and any other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense. For purposes of clarity, and notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) any Target Transaction Expenses which remain unpaid at Closing
shall be deducted from the Closing Merger Consideration paid hereunder, as
provided in the applicable provisions of this Agreement and (ii) neither the
Surviving Corporation nor Acquiror shall be responsible for payment or
reimbursement of the Target Transaction Expenses.

 



 

6.9 _Consents_ _._ Target shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consents or waivers, and provide the notices set forth on _Section
3.15(b)_ of the Target Disclosure Schedule, other than those consents, waivers
and notices set forth in _Schedule D-2_ , which Target shall use its best
efforts to obtain.

 



 

6.10 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_. Acquiror shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Returns for Target and any Subsidiary of Target
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. In the case of Returns
that could form the basis for an indemnity claim against the Effective Time
Holders under this Agreement ("Pre-Closing Period Returns"), such Pre-Closing
Period Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practice of Target or
a Subsidiary of Target, as appropriate (except to the extent counsel for
Acquiror determines in good faith that such Pre-Closing Tax Return cannot be
so prepared and filed or an item so reported without being subject to
penalties). Acquiror shall permit the Securityholders' Agent to review and
comment on each such Pre-Closing Period Returns at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to filing and Acquiror shall consider in good faith all reasonable
comments made by Securityholders' Agent in writing. Without the prior written
consent of Securityholders' Agent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned), Acquiror will not, and will not cause or
permit Target, Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Target to, take any
of the following actions, if such action could reasonably give rise to an
indemnification claim against the Effective Time Holders under this Agreement
unless such action is in conformity with a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law): (i) amend any Returns of or with respect to Target or any
Subsidiary of Target, (ii) make or change any Tax election of or with respect
to Target or any Subsidiary of Target, or (iii) agree to the extension or
waiver of the statute of limitations period or take any other action that has
the effect of extending the period of assessment or collection of any Taxes of
or with respect to Target or any Subsidiary of Target. The parties agree that
Target may take such actions as would result in the payment or accrual of the
Target Employer Share on the Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Allocation of Taxes_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"), the portion of such Tax
which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall to the fullest extent
admissible under Applicable Law of the corresponding federal, state,
provincial and/or local jurisdiction (i) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains or receipts
be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Straddle
Period ended on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Tax Contests_. After the Closing Date, Acquiror, Target and the
Securityholders' Agent, respectively, shall inform the other party in writing
of the commencement of any audit, examination, proceeding or self-assessment
relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which Acquiror may be entitled to
indemnity from the Effective Time Holders under this Agreement ("Tax
Contest"). After the Closing Date, Acquiror shall have the exclusive right to
represent the interests of Target or any Subsidiary of Target in any and all
Tax Contests; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Securityholders' Agent shall
have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest and to employ counsel at
its own expense (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders) of its choice (which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Acquiror) for purposes of such
participation to the extent that any such Tax Contest could reasonably be
expected to result in a Tax indemnification liability of the Effective Time
Holders pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that Acquiror proposes to
compromise or settle any Tax Contest, or consent or agree to any Tax
liability, relating to Target or any Subsidiary of Target that would result in
an indemnity payment by the Effective Time Holders, the Securityholders' Agent
shall have the right to review such proposed compromise, settlement, consent
or agreement, and Acquiror shall not agree or consent to compromise or settle
any such matter unless the Securityholders' Agent consents to such settlement,
compromise or concession, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The provisions of this _Section_ _6.10(c)_ shall
govern rather than the provisions of _Section _ _9_ in the event of any
conflict.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Cooperation_. Acquiror, Target and the Securityholders' Agent shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Return required of
Target, and the defense of any Tax Contest, claim, audit, litigation or other
proceeding, with respect to Taxes which may be payable by Target or any
Subsidiary of Target for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Acquiror, Target and the
Securityholders' Agent agree to abide by all record retention requirements of,
or record retention agreements entered into with, any federal, state,
provincial and/or local Tax authority.

 



 

(e) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes, and all conveyance
fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties
and interest) incurred by Target or any Subsidiary of Target in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be borne and paid one-half by the Effective Time Holders and one-half by
Acquiror when due. The party responsible under Applicable Law for submitting
payment of such Taxes to the applicable Tax authority shall file all necessary
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees. If
required by Applicable Law, Acquiror or Target shall join in the execution of
any such Returns and other documentation.

 



 

6.11 _D andO Insurance_.

 



 

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Acquiror will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of Target to its directors and officers
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Target Indemnified
Parties") pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Restated
Certificate or bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement and pursuant
to any indemnification agreements between Target and such Target Indemnified
Parties as in effect on the date of this Agreement, with respect to claims
arising out of matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of Target and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any adverse manner except as
required by Applicable Law. Any claims for indemnification made under this
_Section_ _6.11(a)_ on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date
shall survive such anniversary until the final resolution thereof. However,
the foregoing covenants under this _Section_ _6.11(a)_ shall not apply to any
claim based on a claim for indemnification made by an Acquiror Indemnified
Person pursuant to _Section_ _9_.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Target shall obtain a non-cancellable extension
of Target's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under Target's existing policies with respect to any actual
or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect,
breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of Target
by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time (the "Tail Policy"); _provided_ that Target
shall give Acquiror a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection
of the Tail Policy and Target shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Acquiror with respect thereto. If
unpaid at Closing, the cost of the Tail Policy shall be treated as a Target
Transaction Expense hereunder. If the Merger is consummated, neither Acquiror
nor the Surviving Corporation will cancel the Tail Policy during its term.

 



 

(c) If Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section _ _6.11_.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to Target or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section _ _6.11_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

(e) To the extent any Target Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses provided by any Person with respect
to matters set forth in this _Section _ _6.11_ , the parties agree that the
Surviving Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort, responsible for
all such indemnification or advancement of expenses, without regard to any
right to indemnification or advancement of expenses that any such Target
Indemnified Party may have from any Person with respect to matters set forth
in this _Section _ _6.11_. The possibility that any Target Indemnified Party
may receive indemnification payments or advancement of expenses from any
Person is not intended to relieve the Surviving Corporation from any liability
that it would otherwise have to make indemnification payments or advance
expenses to such Target Indemnified Party under this _Section _ _6.11_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Acquiror nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable under this Agreement to make any payments of
amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent the Target
Indemnified Party has otherwise actually received such payment under any
insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.

 



 

(f) This _Section _ _6.11_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Target Indemnified Parties; _provided_ that
recourse shall first be against the Tail Policy until it is exhausted before
recovery against Acquiror shall take place.

 



 



 

 



   



 

6.12 _Resignation Letters_. Target shall cause each officer and director of
the Target and its Subsidiaries to execute a resignation letter and
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ _H_ (the "Resignation
Letter"), which shall be effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing;
and Target shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause ClariPhy
Argentina, S.A. to comply with all Applicable Laws related to such
resignations, including calling a shareholder meeting to take notice of the
resignation of the former directors, accepting the resignations, approving
their tenures and appointing new members to the board of directors of ClariPhy
Argentina, S.A.

 



 

6.13 _Contract Termination_. Target shall cause each of the Contracts
listed or described on _Schedule G_ to be terminated or, if requested by
Acquiror, modified, effective as of and contingent upon the Closing, including
sending all required notices, such that each such Contract shall be of no
further force or effect immediately following the Effective Time.

 



 

6.14 _Patent Recording_ _._ Target agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to record executed assignment documents, in the name of Target or its
Subsidiaries, to any Patents listed on the Target Disclosure Schedule with the
United States Patent Office for U.S. patent rights, and with other national
patent offices for the other non-U.S. patent rights to the extent not
otherwise so recorded.

 



 

6.15 _IP Purchase Consideration_. No portion of the IP Purchase
Consideration shall be used to pay or fund the Merger Consideration.

 



 

6.16 _IP Purchase Agreement_. Upon the satisfaction or waiver of each of
the conditions set forth in Section 7 hereof ,other than Section 7.2(w) and
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing),
Acquiror and Target shall immediately satisfy the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(w). If Acquiror shall fail to do so, then the closing condition
set forth in Section 7.2(w) shall be deemed irrevocably waived. If at any time
Acquiror shall determine not to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
the IP Purchase Agreement, then Acquiror shall promptly so notify Target and
the closing condition set forth in Section 7.2(w) shall be deemed irrevocably
waived.

interest, awards, judgments, penalties, Taxes and expenses, including, without

demands, actions, causes of action and settlements, including fees and
expenses of lawyers, experts and other professionals, but excluding any
reductions or diminutions in value, lost profits or opportunities or punitive,
special, incidental or consequential damages (unless such damages are actually
awarded to a third party), in the case of claims other than those relating to
the Specified Matters, and also excluding any costs of investigation, defense
and settlement of any third party claims (unless there is found to be an
underlying breach of a representation, warranty or covenant), and in the case
of claims relating to the Specified Matters, the costs of investigation,
defense and settlement of third party claims shall be included (collectively,
"Damages"), resulting from or arising out of:

 



 



 

 



   



 

(i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties given or made
by Target in _Section_ _3_ of this Agreement, the Target Disclosure Schedule
or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement or in any certificate or document
furnished pursuant hereto by Target to Acquiror, without giving effect to any
update of or modification to the Target Disclosure Schedule made or purported
to have been made after the date hereof;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed
by Target in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or agreement
executed and delivered by Target pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the exercise by any Dissenting Stockholder of appraisal or
dissenters' rights under the Delaware Law, the CCC or other Applicable Law to
the extent such per share Damages exceed the per share Merger Consideration
payable hereunder;

 



 

(iv) any claim by any Person, that such Person was entitled, under the
Restated Certificate, Applicable Law, Contract or otherwise, to a greater
allocation of the Merger Consideration or other consideration than what such
Person received pursuant to this Agreement, if any;

 



 

(v) any inaccuracies in the Payment Schedule, including, for the sake of
clarity, in the calculation of the components of Closing Merger Consideration;

 



 

(vi) any liabilities relating to or arising out of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code;

 



 

(vii) the Specified Matters; and

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the purposes
of the determination of Damages pursuant to _Section _ _9_ , the
representations and warranties of Target in this Agreement that are qualified
by materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be made without
such materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. The Effective Time
Holders shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of
advancement from Target, the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror with respect to
any Damages claimed by an Acquiror Indemnified Person.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. All
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by Target herein,
or in any certificate, schedule or exhibit delivered pursuant hereto, shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing and shall
survive until the date that is twelve (12) months following Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any claims for indemnification involving (i) the
Specified Matters or breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section_ _3.9_ (Intellectual Property) (the "IP Representations"), shall
survive until the date that is twenty-four (24) months following Closing, (ii)
any breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in _Section_
_3.2_ (Authority), _Section_ _3.5_ (Capital Structure), and _Section_ _3.21_
(Taxes) (collectively, the "Specified Representations") and the matters set
forth in _Sections_ _9.2(a)(iv),_ _(v)_ and _(viii)_ shall survive until the
date that is thirty-six (36) months following the Closing, and (iii) Fraud
shall survive until the date that is sixty (60) months following the Closing
and, in each case of (i), (ii) and (iii), shall also survive thereafter until
resolved if a claim in respect thereof has been made prior to the applicable
survival date with respect to such matters. If a claim has been asserted by
Acquiror prior to the termination of the applicable survival date, the
representation or warranty relating to such claim shall survive solely with
respect to such claim until such claim is finally determined in accordance
with this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the time periods set forth
in this _Section_ _9_ and elsewhere in this Agreement for the assertion of
claims and notices under this Agreement are the result of arms'-length
negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be
enforced as agreed hereunder by the parties. The parties further acknowledge
that the time periods set forth in this _Section_ _9_ and elsewhere in the
Agreement may be shorter than otherwise provided by law.

 



 

(c) _Threshold_. No claim for Damages made under _Sections_ _
____9.2(a)(i)_ _or_ _(a)(ii)_ by Acquiror Indemnified Person shall be made
unless the aggregate amount of all Damages in respect of such claims exceeds
$1,000,000 (the "Threshold"), in which event the Effective Time Holders shall
be required to pay or be liable for all such Damages from the first dollar;
provided, however, that the Threshold shall not apply with respect to any
Damages resulting from or arising out of (i) Fraud or any breach of the
Specified Representations (collectively, "Fundamental Claims") or (ii) any
breach of the IP Representations. For the sake of clarity, the Threshold shall
not apply to claims for Damages pursuant to _Section_ _9.2(a)(iii)_ through
_9.2(a)(vii)_ , or pursuant to _Section_ _9.2(a)(viii)_.

 



 

(d) _Cap on Indemnification by Effective Time Holders_. The aggregate
amount to be paid by the Effective Time Holders for claims for Damages made
under this Agreement shall not exceed the amount of the Escrow Consideration
(the "Cap") and with respect to the matters set forth in _Section_ _9.2(a)(i)_
(but excluding the Fundamental Claims) _Section_ _9.2(a)(ii)_ _,_ _Section_
_9.2(a)(iii)_ , _Section_ _9.2(a)(vi)_ and _Section_ _9.2(a)(vii)_ , recovery
from the account containing the Escrow Consideration maintained with the
Escrow Agent shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery for Damages
made under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to
any Damages based upon Fundamental Claims or the matters set forth in
_Section_ _9.2(a)(iv)_ , _Section_ _9.2(a)(v)_ or _Section_ _9.2(a)(viii)_.
The liability of each Effective Time Holder for Fundamental Claims shall not
exceed the portion of the Merger Consideration actually received by each
Effective Time Holder and, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, under no circumstances shall any Effective Time Holder be liable to
the Acquiror Indemnified Persons for an aggregate amount in excess of the
Merger Consideration actually received by such Effective Time Holder, except
with respect to Fraud that an Effective Time Holder, knew of, knowingly aided,
abetted, committed, facilitated or otherwise participated in, in which case,
the liability of such Effective Time Holder shall not be capped.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no claim for Damages
may be made against, and no Damages may be recovered from, any Effective Time
Holder unless and until the account containing the Escrow Consideration
maintained with the Escrow Agent has been exhausted, distributed or reserved
for pending claims.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) None of the Acquiror Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover
from the Effective Time Holders and Acquiror, on behalf of each of their
respective Acquiror Indemnified Persons, waives, any right to recover
reductions or diminutions in value, lost profits or opportunities or punitive,
special, incidental or consequential damages, unless such damages are actually
awarded to an adverse party in an indemnifiable third-party claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Specified Matters, the
Acquiror Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover from the Effective
Time Holders any costs of investigation, defense and settlement of any third
party claims (whether or not there is found to be an underlying breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement: claims by an
Acquiror Indemnified Person for Damages due to Fraud committed by or on behalf
of Target or its Subsidiaries and all of their Representatives in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
satisfied: (i) first, from the account containing the Escrow Consideration
maintained with the Escrow Agent, but only after (1) satisfying all other
pending claims that are not claims for Fraud committed by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (2) making appropriate reserves as provided in the Escrow
Agreement for any unresolved claim, and (ii) second, if such account is
insufficient after such satisfaction or reserve, at the election of an
Acquiror Indemnified Person, directly from each Effective Time Holder,
severally in accordance with such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Portion of
the Damages and not jointly, up to (and not in excess of) the aggregate Merger
Consideration actually received by such Effective Time Holder hereunder;
provided, however, that no cap shall apply to an Effective Time Holder if such
Effective Time Holder knew of, knowingly aided, abetted, committed,
facilitated, or otherwise participated in such Fraud.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Effective Time Holders shall not be liable for (i) any Taxes resulting from an
election made under Code Section 338, Code Section 336 or under any comparable
provisions of any other state, local or foreign laws, (ii) the amount, value
or condition of, or any limitations on, any Tax asset or attribute of Target
or any Subsidiary of Target (e.g., net operating loss or net operating
carryforward or Tax credits), including the ability of Acquirer or any of its
affiliates to utilize such Tax assets or Tax attributes after the Closing,
(iii) any Taxes arising from the IP Purchase Agreement or (iv) any Taxes of
Target and its Subsidiaries for a Post-Closing Tax Period treating
transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing that are not in
the ordinary course of business as having occurred in a Post-Closing Tax
Period.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the IP Purchase
Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein shall be disregarded in
determining the Merger Consideration, any adjustments to the Merger
Consideration, the amount of any Damages, inaccuracy or breach of
representations and warranties of Target, breach of or compliance with any
covenants of Target, the Securityholders' Agent or the Effective Time Holders
or whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or might occur. No claim for
indemnification may be made by any Acquiror Indemnified Persons (or any of its
Affiliates, including from and after the Closing, Target, the Surviving
Corporation and their Subsidiaries), and the Effective Time Holders shall not
be liable, for any Damages, including for Pre-Closing Taxes, directly
resulting from or arising out of the IP Purchase Agreement and the
transactions contemplated therein, and for purposes of this Agreement the Tax
attributes of Target and its Subsidiaries (including net operating losses and
credits) shall not be reduced or otherwise affected as a result of the IP
Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. Any Damages, any
costs of investigation, defense or settlement of any third party claims
incurred or suffered by an Effective Time Holder directly resulting from or
arising out of the IP Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated
therein may be offset against any Damages an Effective Time Holder is required
to pay to an Acquiror Indemnified Person.

 



 

 



   



 

9.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

 



 

(a) A claim for indemnification under this _Section _ _9_ shall be made
by Acquiror or an Acquiror Indemnified Person by delivering to the
Securityholders' Agent, on or before the end of the applicable survival period
for a particular claim as set forth in _Section_ _9_ a certificate signed by
any officer of Acquiror (an "Officer's Certificate") stating that Damages
exist with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Effective Time
Holders, and specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such
Damages included in the amount so stated, and the nature of the breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or claim to which such item is related. The
amount of the Damages claimed in the Officer's Certificate shall not be
issuable to the Effective Time Holders until resolved pursuant to the terms
hereof. Acquiror and the Acquiror Indemnified Persons shall reasonably
cooperate and assist the Securityholders' Agent and the Effective Time Holders
in determining the validity of any claim for Damages or indemnification by
Acquiror or the Acquiror Indemnified Persons and in otherwise resolving such
matters, such assistance and cooperation to include providing reasonable
access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such
matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and
resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with
respect to such matters.

 



 

(b) If the Securityholders' Agent does not contest, by written notice to
Acquiror, the Damages claimed by Acquiror in any Officer's Certificate within
twenty (20) Business Days after any such Officer's Certificate is received by
the Securityholders' Agent, then the Securityholders' Agent will be
conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf of all Effective Time
Holders, to the recovery by the Acquiror Indemnified Persons of the full
amount of Damages specified in the Officer's Certificate, including the
forfeiture of such amount from the Escrow Consideration (subject to the terms
and conditions in this _Section _ _9_ ) having a value sufficient to satisfy
such Damages and, without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a
final judgment for the Damages against the Securityholders' Agent for such
amount in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

 



 

(c) If the Securityholders' Agent disputes any claim or claims made in any
Officer's Certificate by providing written notice thereof to the Acquiror
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items in dispute and the nature
of the dispute, Acquiror shall have twenty (20) Business Days to respond in a
written statement to the objection of the Securityholders' Agent. If after
such twenty (20) Business Days period there remains a dispute as to any
claims, the Securityholders' Agent and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith
for twenty (20) Business Days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholders' Agent and
Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by Acquiror and the Securityholders' Agent.

 



 

(d) Acquiror and the Securityholders' Agent shall simultaneously deliver
to the Escrow Agent a copy of any Officer's Certificate or written notice
delivered pursuant to this _Section_ _9.3_.

 



 

9.4 _Resolution of Conflicts_. If no agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiations between the parties pursuant to _Section _ _9.3(a)_ ,
either Acquiror or the Securityholders' Agent may submit the matter to binding
Arbitration in accordance with _Section _ _10.5_ to resolve such dispute. The
decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Officer's Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in _Section _ _9_ hereof, the parties
shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision.

 



 



 

 



   



 

9.5 _Securityholders ' Agent_.

 



 

(a) The Securityholders' Agent shall be constituted and appointed as the
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Effective Time
Holders and shall have full power authority to represent, to give and receive
notices and communications, to authorize the release of any portion of the
Escrow Consideration to Acquiror in satisfaction of claims under this
Agreement by Acquiror, to object to such releases, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims,
to act on the Effective Time Holders' behalf with respect to the matters set
forth herein, in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth herein,
including giving and receiving all notices and communications to be given or
received with respect to the matters set forth in this _Section_ _9_ and to
take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Securityholders' Agent for the interpretation of this Agreement and
accomplishment of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Securityholders' Agent shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders, except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement and the Securityholders' Agent engagement agreement, and for
purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholders' Agent in
any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Target Disclosure Schedule.
The Securityholders' Agent may resign at any time and such agency may be
changed by the vote of Effective Time Holders representing a majority in
interest of the Escrow Consideration from time to time upon not less than ten
(10) days' prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the
Securityholders' Agent. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Effective Time Holders. The Securityholders' Agent shall be entitled to: (i)
rely upon the Payment Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to
be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Effective Time Holder or
other party. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to
the Securityholders' Agent Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Effective Time Holder and shall be binding on any successor
thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Effective
Time Holder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Escrow Consideration.

 



 

(b) Certain Effective Time Holders have entered into an engagement
agreement with the Securityholders' Agent to provide direction to the
Securityholders' Agent in connection with its services under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement and the Securityholders' Agent engagement agreement (such
Effective Time Holders, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). Neither the
Securityholders' Agent nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the "Securityholders' Agent Group") shall be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Securityholders' Agent while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith. The Effective Time Holders shall severally, in accordance with their
Pro Rata Portion, indemnify, defend and hold the Securityholders' Agent Group
harmless against any loss, liability, claim, damage, cost, fee, fine,
judgment, amount paid in settlement or expense (including fees, disbursements
and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers) (collectively, the "Securityholders' Agent
Expenses") incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Securityholders' Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties hereunder. Such Securityholders' Agent
Expenses may be recovered first, from the Expense Fund, second, from any
distribution of the Escrow Consideration otherwise distributable to the
Effective Time Holders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from
the Effective Time Holders. The Effective Time Holders acknowledge that the
Securityholders' Agent shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of
any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Furthermore, the Securityholders' Agent shall not be required to take any
action unless the Securityholders' Agent has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Securityholders' Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Securityholders' Agent in performing such actions. The
immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Securityholders' Agent or any member of the Advisory Group and
the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) The Securityholders' Agent shall have reasonable access to information
about Target and the Target Subsidiaries and the reasonable assistance of
Target's and the Target's Subsidiaries' officers and employees for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the
Securityholders' Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any
nonpublic information from or about Target or any Target Subsidiary to anyone
(except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
information confidentially).

 



 

(d) Upon the Closing, Acquiror shall wire to the Securityholders' Agent
$1,000,000 (the "Expense Fund Amount"). The Expense Fund Amount shall be held
by the Securityholders' Agent in a segregated client account and shall be used
(i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Securityholders'
Agent for any Securityholders' Agent Expenses incurred pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Securityholders' Agent letter
agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group (the "Expense
Fund"). The Securityholders' Agent is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result
of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholders' Agent is
not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution
obligations. The Effective Time Holders will not receive any interest on the
Expense Fund and assign to the Securityholders' Agent any such interest.
Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Securityholders' Agent may contribute
funds to the Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to
the Effective Time Holders. As soon as reasonably determined by the
Securityholders' Agent that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be
withheld, the Securityholders' Agent shall distribute the remaining Expense
Fund (if any) to the Payment Agent for further distribution to the Effective
Time Holders.

 



 



 

 



   



 

9.6 _Actions of the Securityholders ' Agent_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Effective Time Holders for whom the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
them is released to Acquiror from the Escrow Consideration with respect to the
matters set forth herein and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
Effective Time Holder and such Effective Time Holder's successors as if
expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Effective Time Holder, and
all defenses which may be available to any Effective Time Holder to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders' Agent taken in good
faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholders' Agent
engagement agreement are waived. Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Securityholders' Agent as being the decision,
act, consent or instruction of each and every Effective Time Holder. Acquiror
is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by
Acquiror in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholders' Agent.

 



 

9.7 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event an Acquiror Indemnified Person or
Acquiror becomes aware of a third-party claim which an Acquiror Indemnified
Person or Acquiror believes may result in Damages, Acquiror shall notify the
Securityholders' Agent of such claim. Acquiror shall have the right in its
sole discretion to defend any such claim. Acquiror shall seek the prior
written consent of the Securityholder's Agent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) before settling any third-party claim; provided,
however, that Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle
any claim (or series of related claims) not involving any Special Matters in
an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000 so long as such amount can be
satisfied in full from the account containing the Escrow Consideration
maintained with the Escrow Agent. In the event that the Securityholders' Agent
has consented to any such settlement, the Securityholders' Agent shall have no
power or authority to object under _Section _ _9.3_ or any other provision of
this _Section _ _9_ to the amount of any claim by Acquiror against the Escrow
Consideration for indemnity with respect to such settlement. With respect to
any third-party claims involving the Special Matters, Acquiror agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to diligently prosecute the defense of
such Third Party Claims and minimize all fees and expenses in connection
therewith prior to agreeing to any settlement of such matters (such settlement
which shall be subject to the consent rights of the Securityholders' Agent as
set forth herein).

 



 

9.8 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All amounts received by
Acquiror Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Section_ _9_ shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the aggregate Merger Consideration.

 



 

9.9 _Effect of Investigation_. The right to indemnification, payment of
Damages or for other remedies based on any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation of Target and/or the Effective Time Holders contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the date the
Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of
any condition to the obligation of Acquiror to consummate the Merger, where
such condition is based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or
on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not
affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based
on such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

 



 



 

 



   



 

9.10 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that
its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein, any right or obligation under this Agreement or otherwise
relating to this Agreement (including as to this Agreement's existence,
enforceability, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or damages,
including claims in tort and Damages due to Fraud) as well as other provisions
of this Agreement (i.e. the right to the remedy of specific performance under
_Section_ _10.8)_ , shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Section_ _9_. Acquiror further acknowledges and agrees that,
except as set forth in _Section_ _9.2(d)_ , its sole and exclusive source of
recovery for claims for Damages made under this Agreement shall be limited to
the account containing the Escrow Consideration maintained with the Escrow
Agent.

10.3 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This
Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits and
schedules hereto, including the Target Disclosure Schedule: (a) together
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both

10.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

10.5 _Governing Law; Arbitration_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of California applicable to
parties residing in California, without regard applicable principles of
conflicts of law, other than the definition of Fraud, which shall be governed
by Delaware law. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating
to any right or obligation under this Agreement or the making, performance,
breach, termination, existence, enforcement, interpretation or validity
hereof, whether arising before or after the termination of this Agreement,
including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to
arbitrate, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation
or any other legal theory, shall be determined by confidential binding
arbitration held in Orange County, California before one arbitrator (the
"Arbitration"). The Arbitration shall be final and binding. The Arbitration
shall be submitted to JAMS or its successor (collectively, "JAMS") and
administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures (the "JAMS Rules"). Either party may initiate Arbitration by
filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS. The parties shall each
advance one half of the arbitrator's fees and administrative costs of the
Arbitration. The arbitrator shall interpret and apply the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with the law governing this
Agreement (without reference to the conflict of law provisions of either
California or Delaware that would require the application of the law of
another jurisdiction) and the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator's award shall be
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall only
award those rights and/or remedies that are expressly provided hereunder. The
arbitrator shall have the non-exclusive authority to grant injunctive relief
and order specific performance as contemplated by the parties in _Section_
_10.8_ below. The final award of the arbitrator shall include a concise
written statement of the reasons for the award as contemplated by rule 24(h)
of the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator, at the arbitrator's discretion, shall award
to the prevailing party or parties, if any, the costs (including advanced JAMS
payments) and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party or
parties in connection with the Arbitration taking into account the extent of
the prevailing party's or parties' victory. Judgment on the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court of appropriate jurisdiction. This
clause shall not preclude any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid
of arbitration ( _e.g._ , injunctive relief) from the Superior Court of the
County of Orange, State of California, or, to the extent such court declines
jurisdiction, any state court in the State of California or any federal court
located in the County of Orange, State of California. All parties hereto
hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or subject matter
jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any such suit, action or
other proceeding.

 



 



 

 



   



 

10.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_ _._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. __

 



 

10.7 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

 



 

10.8 _Specific Enforcement_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other would be irreparably harmed and would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by such other party in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly each party agrees that the other party shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

10.9 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any amendment or waiver of any of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and must be duly executed by
or on behalf of the party to be charged with such waiver. The failure of a
party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict
adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a later
date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term of condition
hereof (whether or not similar).

Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to

10.11 _Certain Waivers_ _. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives and Affiliates,
that:_

 



 

(a) Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP has acted as counsel to the
Effective Time Holders and their Affiliates (individually and collectively,
the "Target Group") and Target in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Acquiror agrees, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to agree, that, following the Closing, such
representation and any prior representation of the Target Group or Target by
Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP (or any successor) (the "Target Group Law
Firm") shall not preclude Target Group Law Firm from serving as counsel to the
Target Group or any director, member, shareholder, partner, officer or
employee of Target or the Target Group, in connection with any litigation,
claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

 



 

(b) Acquiror shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to,
seek or have Target Group Law Firm disqualified from any such representation
based upon the prior representation of the Target Group or Target by Target
Group Law Firm. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives
any conflict of interest arising solely from such prior representation, and
each of such parties shall cause any of its Affiliates to consent to waive any
conflict of interest arising from such representation. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has
been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel or
have been advised they should do so in connection herewith. The covenants,
consent and waiver contained in this Section shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which the Target Group Law Firm is entitled whether
pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) All materials (including communications) that are both (1) contained
in files including, but not limited to, electronic files and records of the
law firms listed on _Schedule_ _10.11(c)_ (the "Transaction Law Firms")
relating to the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that
are held as of the Effective Time solely and exclusively by the Transaction
Law Firms and (2) constitute attorney-client privileged and/or work product
protected materials (collectively, the "Privileged Material") shall belong
solely to the Target Group and shall not pass to or be claimed by Acquiror or
the Surviving Corporation. Accordingly, from and after the Closing, Acquiror
and the Surviving Corporation shall not have access to the Privileged Material
relating to such engagement except as contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as contemplated by this
Agreement, from and after the Closing, (i) the Target Group (and not Acquiror
or the Surviving Corporation) shall be the sole holders of the Privileged
Material, and (ii) the Transaction Law Firms shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any of such Privileged Material to Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
the applicable Transaction Law Firm and the Target Group or Target.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Acquiror or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), on the one
hand, and a third party other than any of the Target Group, on the other hand,
Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) may assert
the attorney-client privilege and/or work product protection to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party; provided,
however, that neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) may waive such privilege or protection without the
prior written consent of the Securityholders' Agent, which consent may be
withheld in their sole and absolute discretion. In the event that Acquiror or
any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) is legally
required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged
Material (including as required to assert the attorney-client privilege (
_e.g._ , to create a privilege log as to the Privileged Material)) and such
action is advisable in the opinion of Acquiror's counsel, then Acquiror shall
immediately (and, in any event, within 2 days) notify the Securityholders'
Agent in writing so that it can immediately (and, in any event, within 5 court
days) seek a protective order on behalf of the Target Group. If such a
protective order is not sought within the applicable time frame, then the
Securityholders' Agent shall immediately release all materials requested by
the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to
the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Acquiror nor its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) is waiving any work product protection
or any attorney-client privilege (including relating to the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby) in connection with any third-party
Litigation. _Except for the Privileged Materials_ , the Acquiror and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) shall be the sole holders of
any and all attorney-client privileged or work product protected materials
that is held or otherwise controlled by the Target Group including all
materials in the files of the Transaction Law Firms that relate to the Target
Group.
