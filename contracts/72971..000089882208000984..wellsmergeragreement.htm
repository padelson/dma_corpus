 B. The Boards of Directors of Company and Parent have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into, Company (the " _Merger_ "), with Company as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ").

 

 C. Simultaneous with the entry into this Agreement, Parent and Company are entering into a share exchange agreement in the form set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Share Exchange Agreement_ ").

 

 D. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 

    ARTICLE I 
  
 THE MERGER 
--- 

 

 1.1 _The Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Business Corporation Act of the State of North Carolina (the " _BCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company. Company shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of North Carolina. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.

 

 (b) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of Company with and into Parent or otherwise restructuring the transaction to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning to Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ")) if and to the extent requested by Parent, and Company and Merger Sub agree to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement

  or (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

 

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the BCA.

 

 1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $3.33 1/3 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $3.33 1/3, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (b) All shares of common stock, par value $3.33 1/3 per share, of Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the preferred share purchase rights attached thereto pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement, the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by Company or Parent (other than shares of Company Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust Account Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Company or Parent in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 (c) Subject to Section 1.4(e), each share of the Company Common Stock, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company or Parent (other than Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares), shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, into the right to receive 0.1991 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of common stock, par value $1 2/3 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

 (d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c).

  (e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration.

 

1.5 _Stock Options_.

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding and unexercised employee and director options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") will cease to represent an option to purchase Company Common Stock and will be converted automatically into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, and Parent will assume each Company Stock Option subject to its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time:

 

 (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option will equal the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable under the Company Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

 

 (ii) the per share exercise price for each Company Stock Option will equal the quotient of (i) the per share exercise price of the Company Stock Option in effect immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with any applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and (ii) that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any rights resulting from the transactions contemplated under this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements thereunder). As used in this Agreement, " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, A.G. Edwards, Inc. 1988 Incentive Stock Plan (2005 Restatement), as amended, Wachovia Corporation 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, Wachovia Employee Stock Plan (as amended April 16, 2002), Wachovia Corporation 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, Wachovia Employee Stock Retention Plan, Golden West Financial Corporation 1996 Stock Option Plan, as amended, Westcorp 2001 Stock Option Plan, Everen Capital Corporation 1996 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan, Republic Security Financial Corp 1997 Performance Incentive Plan, 1996 SouthTrust Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan, 2004 SouthTrust Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan and Everen Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.

 

 1.6 _Other Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or

  benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock,
and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock,
granted under the Company Stock Plans (including restricted stock, restricted
stock units, deferred stock units, phantom stock units and dividend
equivalents), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Company Stock Options) (each, a " _Company Stock Award_ ") shall
cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award
with respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent will assume each Company Stock
Award subject to its terms; _provided, however,_ that after the Effective Time
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Award
will equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock Award immediately before the Effective Time and
(b) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Award shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time (after giving effect to any rights resulting from the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the
award agreements thereunder).

 

 1.7 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms of such by-laws.

 

 1.8 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to applicable law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

 1.9 _Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of each series of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into a share of Parent Preferred Stock having rights, privileges, powers and preferences substantially identical to those of the relevant series of Company Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.9 to the contrary, any holder of Company Preferred Stock may elect to be paid the "fair value" of his or her Company Preferred Stock pursuant to the procedure set forth in Article 13 of the BCA (such holder, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "); _provided_ such Dissenting Stockholder follows the procedures and takes action in accordance with such Article of the BCA. If any Dissenting Stockholder gives notice to Company, Company will promptly give Parent notice thereof, and Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Neither Company nor Surviving Corporation will, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses the right to dissent, the Company Preferred Stock

  held by such Dissenting Stockholder will thereupon be treated as though such
shares had been converted into Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section
1.9.

 

 1.10 _Effect on Parent Stock; Required Parent Action_. Each share of Parent Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding. Before the Effective Time, Parent will take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options in accordance with Section 1.5 and for delivery under Company Stock Awards in accordance with Section 1.6. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will file one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form S-3 or Form S-8 or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the Parent Common Stock underlying the Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.5 and subject to the Company Stock Awards pursuant to Section 1.6.

 

    ARTICLE II 
--- 

 

    DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 
--- 

 

 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company Subsidiary of Parent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company, or Parents transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder.

 

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) authorize the Exchange Agent to issue an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited with, the Exchange Agent, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

 

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the

  Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest,
the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

 

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

 

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash

  in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Article II.

 

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

 

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Parent. In such event, any former shareholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Each of Parent and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

 (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities. Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the information relating to Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (c) Each of Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (d) Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Company, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption of Companys outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and (to the extent informed such requirement by Company) other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

  (e) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or Company Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

 6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. Neither Company nor Parent, nor any of their Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 6.3 _Shareholder Approval_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Company has adopted resolutions approving the Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and directing that the Merger, on such terms and conditions, be submitted to Companys shareholders for their consideration. The Board of Directors of Company will submit to its shareholders the plan of merger contained in this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved or adopted by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, Company will take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as practicable, to consider and vote upon approval of the plan of merger as well as any other such matters. The record date for any such meeting of Company shareholders shall be determined in prior consultation with and subject to the prior approval of Parent, and shall in any case be no fewer than 3 business days after the Share Exchange Closing. The Board of Directors of Company will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders a vote approving and adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement. However, if the Board of Directors of Company,

  after consultation with (and based on the advice of) counsel, determines in
good faith that, because of a conflict of interest or other special
circumstances (it being agreed that such special circumstances will include,
for purposes of this Agreement, the receipt by Company of an Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal), it would violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend the plan of merger set forth in this
Agreement, then in submitting the plan of merger to Companys shareholders,
the Board of Directors of Company may submit the plan of merger to its
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the Board of Directors of Company may communicate the basis for its lack
of a recommendation to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
_provided_ that it may not take any actions under this sentence until after
giving Parent at least five business days to respond to any such Acquisition
Proposal or other circumstances giving rise to such particular proposed action
(and after giving Parent notice of the latest material terms, conditions and
identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal or describe in
reasonable detail such other circumstances) and then taking into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent (it being
agreed that paragraph six of the Confidentiality Agreement will not preclude
such a response or proposal).

 

 6.4 _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of capital stock of Parent to be issued in exchange for capital stock of the Company that is currently listed on the NYSE upon consummation of the Merger to have been authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

 6.5 _Employee Matters_. (a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries), as applicable; _provided_ , that (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries; and (ii) until such time as Parent shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the benefit plans and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employees continued participation in employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities of Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the Parent plans may commence at different times with respect to each Parent plan).

 

 (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Company or its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable

  Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such
recognition of service (A) shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, (B) shall not
apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement under which similarly-
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service and (C) shall not apply with respect to the Wells Fargo Cash
Balance Plan; and (ii) with respect to any health, dental, vision plan or
other welfare of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its
Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the
plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, use
its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary
plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (B) recognize any health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the
year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date hereof or as may be amended or terminated after the date hereof with the prior written consent of Parent, each employment agreement and change in control agreement to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and the obligations of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under each deferred compensation plan or agreement to which they are a party.

 

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this Section 6.5 be construed to require the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date.

 

 (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, the provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose.

 

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Benefit Plans_ " means each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each employment, consulting, bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, vacation, stock option or other equity-based, severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit-sharing, fringe benefit or other similar plan, program, agreement or commitment, whether written or unwritten, for the benefit of any employee, former employee, director or former director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into, maintained or contributed to

  by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute, or with respect to which Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, direct or indirect, contingent or
otherwise (including any liability arising out of an indemnification,
guarantee, hold harmless or similar agreement) or otherwise providing benefits
to any current, former or future employee, officer or director of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or to any beneficiary or dependant thereof.

 

 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director, officer and employee of Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement.

 

 (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent will provide directors and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for the Company) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by Company.

 

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.6(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent; _provided_ that failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 6.6(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence.

 

 (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

 6.7 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b_ ). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company shall each take all such steps as may be

  necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the applicable SEC
No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999.

 

 6.8 _No Solicitation_.

 

 (a) Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, or waive any provision of or amend the terms of the Company Rights Agreement, in respect of an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, in the event Company receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith (and based on the advice of counsel) that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement as entered into on September 26, 2008, and it shall simultaneously provide Parent with any such nonpublic information to the extent it has not previously provided such information to Parent. Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Company will promptly (within two business days) advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

 

 (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

 As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "100%".

 (b) by either Company or Parent, if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or a Company Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 (c) by either Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 

 (d) by either Company or Parent (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 60 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

 

 (e) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of Company submits this Agreement (or the plan of merger contained herein) to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, the Board of Directors of Company otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation referred to in Section 6.3, or the Board of Directors of Company recommends to its shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger;

 

 (f) by Parent, if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, injunction or decree, which order, injunction or decree remains in effect and has become final and nonappealable, that permanently enjoins or prohibits or makes illegal the issuance of shares of the Series M Preferred Stock of the Company to Parent pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement or prevents Parent from voting such shares in favor of approving and adopting this Agreement at the meeting of Company shareholders held for that purpose; or

  (g) by either Company or Parent, if the approval of the Company\'s shareholders required by Section 7.1(a) shall not have been obtained at a duly held meeting of Company shareholders convened for the purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement.

 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Company, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." All schedules and exhibits hereto shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that any provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it is the express intention of the parties that such provision, covenant or restriction be enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

 

 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart.

 

 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and performed entirely within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or state court located in the State of New York. Each of the parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of

  jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such
action or proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

 9.8 _Publicity_. Neither Company nor Parent shall, and neither Company nor Parent shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Company, or Company, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement to the extent required by law or by the rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 

 9.9 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law or equity.

 

 9.11 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement, Company delivered to Parent a schedule (a " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") that sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article III, or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means information set forth by Company in the applicable paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule, or any other paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule (so long as it is reasonably clear from the context that the

  disclosure in such other paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule is also
applicable to the section of this Agreement in question).

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Company and Parent have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.
