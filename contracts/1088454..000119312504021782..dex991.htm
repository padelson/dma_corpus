representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable

ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Company (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Company as the surviving corporation after
the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."



1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger, and such other articles, certificates or other
appropriate filing documents with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law
(collectively, the "Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing (or such
later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in
the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable
on or after the Closing Date (as herein defined). Unless the context
otherwise requires, the term "Agreement" as used herein refers collectively
to this Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and the Certificate of Merger.
The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill
Road, Palo Alto, California at a time and date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions
which, by their terms, are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), or at
such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the
"Closing Date").



1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers,
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving
Corporation. 



1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 



(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_
, that at the Effective Time the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
changed to NetScreen Technologies, Inc.



 

-2- (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to be identical to those in effect for Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter amended.



1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly appointed.



1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the
following securities, the following shall occur:



(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock, $0.001
par value per share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will
be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to
Sections 1.6(e) and (f)) into the right to receive that number of shares of
Common Stock, $0.00001 par value per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common
Stock") equal to 1.404 (the "Exchange Ratio"), upon surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in Section 1.9). If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such
shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends. Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is
entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in
any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Company.



(b) _Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.



(c) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all options to purchase Company
Common Stock then outstanding under each of Companys 1997 Equity Incentive
Plan, 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, OneSecure, Inc. 2000 Stock Option/Stock
Issuance Plan, Neoteris 2001 Stock Plan, 2002 Stock Option Plan and any other
plan or agreement pursuant to which options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock have been granted or are outstanding following their assumption
by  



 

-3-  Company (collectively, the "Company Option Plans") shall be assumed by
Parent in accordance with Section 5.9. Rights outstanding under Companys
2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") shall be treated as set
forth in Section 5.9.



(d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of Common Stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock,
$0.00001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.



(f) _Fractional Shares_. Shares evidencing the right to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) will not
be delivered to former holders of Company Common Stock who surrender such
Company Common Stock for exchange. Each former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of Parent
Common Stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Markets National Market
("Nasdaq"), for the five (5) trading days ending on and including the last
full trading day prior to the Effective Time.



1.7 _Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Cash and Stock Consideration_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
the Merger.



(b)  _Parent to Provide Common Stock and, if Applicable, Cash Consideration_.
Prior to or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with the Exchange Agent, which shall provide that, promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for
exchange in accordance with this Article I, (i) the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, (ii) cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f), and (iii) any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).



 

-4- (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock which shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, the right to receive
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f), and any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant
to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of
Company Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time, payment in lieu of
fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes to evidence only the
ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted, the right to
receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.7(d).



(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect
to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be
paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificate(s) with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record
of such Certificate(s) shall surrender such Certificate(s). Subject
to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate(s), the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest,
(i) a certificate(s) representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 1.6(f) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.



(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate representing shares
of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
persons requesting  



 

-5-  such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.



(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may
be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable
legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.



(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar law.



1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms hereof (together with any cash paid in respect
thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
I.



1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, a certificate
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates was converted pursuant
to Section 1.6, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required
pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.7(d); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock and other distributions, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



 

-6- 1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Income Tax Regulations. 



1.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title, and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized to take, and will
take, all such lawful and necessary action.



ARTICLE II



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY



Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to such
exceptions as are specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure letter
and schedules thereto (which exceptions shall reference the specific section
and, if applicable, subsection number of this Article II to which it applies,
and any information disclosed in any such section or subsection shall be
deemed to be disclosed only for purposes of such section or subsection,
except to the extent it is readily apparent that the disclosure contained in
such section or subsection contains enough information regarding the subject
matter of other representations and warranties contained in this Article II
so as to qualify or otherwise apply to such other representations and
warranties), dated as of the date hereof (the "Company Schedule"), as follows:

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as

Adverse Effect on Company. Each of Company and its subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Approvals")
necessary to own, operate or lease the properties it purports to own, operate

where the failure to have such Approvals has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3(b)(ii)) on Company. Each of Company
and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except  



 

-7-  where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing has not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company.



(b) Company has no subsidiaries except for the corporations identified in
Section 2.1(b) of the Company Schedule. Neither Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has agreed to make or is obligated to make or is bound by any
written or oral agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, permit, franchise,
binding understanding, instrument, note, option, warranty, purchase order,
license, sublicense, indenture, insurance policy, benefit plan, or legally
binding commitment or undertaking of any nature, as of the date hereof or as
may hereafter be in effect (a "Contract") under which it may become obligated
to make, any future investment in or capital contribution to any other entity.
Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any
equity or similar interest in or any interest convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business, association or entity, except

of public companies as part of Companys cash management program.

Parent a complete and correct copy of its Certificate of Incorporation and

of its subsidiaries are in full force and effect. Company is not in violation
of any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents, and no subsidiary
of Company is in violation of its equivalent organizational documents, except,
in the case of its subsidiaries, where such violation would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Company.

in oral or written form) to any Employee (either individually or to Employees
as a group) or any other person that such Employee(s) or other person would

law applicable to its Employees.



(i) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either

Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will or may result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any Employee. Company is not, nor has it ever
been, a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity agreement or any other
agreement that will require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to "gross-up"
or otherwise compensate any Employee because of the imposition of any excise

with past practice), and (iv) are in material compliance with all applicable
foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages
and hours with respect to Employees. There are no pending, or to Companys
knowledge, threatened claims or actions against Company under any workers
compensation policy or long-term disability policy. The services provided by
each of the Employees are terminable at the will of Company or an ERISA
Affiliate, and any such termination would result in no material liability to
Company or to any ERISA Affiliate.



(k) _Labor_. No work stoppage or labor strike against Company or any ERISA
Affiliate is pending, threatened in writing or reasonably anticipated
by Company or any ERISA Affiliate. To Companys and each ERISA Affiliates

organize any Employees. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or
grievances pending or, to Companys and each ERISA Affiliates knowledge,
threatened, in each case relating to any labor, discrimination or material
safety matters involving any Employee, including, without limitation, charges
of material unfair labor practices or discrimination complaints. Neither
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any unfair labor practices
within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Neither Company nor

regulatory laws that are applicable to such International Employee Plan.  



 

-18-  Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities, that,
as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully
accrued. Except as required by law, no condition exists that would prevent
Company or Parent from terminating or amending any International Employee Plan
at any time for any reason without liability to Company or any ERISA
Affiliates (other than routine administration expenses or routine claims for
benefits).



(m)  _Executive Loans_. Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has violated
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the execution of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not cause such a
violation. 



(n) _WARN Act_. Since the enactment of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the "WARN Act"), (i) neither Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has effected a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act)
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility, (ii) there has not occurred a "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or

not yet due and payable, (ii) as reflected in the financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Reports, and (iii) for such liens or other
imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value
of, or interfere with the present use of the property affected thereby; and
all leases pursuant to which Company or any of its subsidiaries lease from
others real or personal property are valid and effective in accordance with
their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any
existing material default or material event of default (or any event which
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default).
All the plants, structures and equipment of Company and its subsidiaries,
except such as may be under construction, are in good operating condition and
repair, in all material respects, subject to normal wear and tear. There is no
pending or, to Companys knowledge, threatened (in writing) condemnation or

outside financial and legal advisors, concludes that such Acquisition Proposal
is, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), engaging in discussions or participating in negotiations with
and furnishing information to the party making such Acquisition Proposal so
long as, and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of Company

outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting

(iv) The Board of Directors of Company has concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be a breach of its fiduciary obligations to Companys
stockholders under applicable law; and



(v) Company shall have complied in all material respects with this Section
5.3.



(d) _Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Company Stockholders 
Meeting; No Other Vote_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the

Company Voting Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger, this
Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this
Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company will notify the other promptly
upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental
Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto; and (ii) any
request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply
in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements. Whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant hereto, Parent, Merger Sub or Company, as the case may
be, will promptly inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. 



(c) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate,
or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.



(d) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company of any representation or
warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue
or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or
satisfy in any respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.



5.8 _Third Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
Parent and Company will each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries
respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained

-49- 5.9 _Stock Options; 401(k) Plan; Company Employee Plan Matters_.



(a) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all options
to purchase Common Stock issued by Company pursuant to the Company Option
Plans, whether vested or unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable
(each a "Company Option"). Companys repurchase right with respect to any
unvested shares acquired by the exercise of Company Options shall be assigned
to Parent by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part
of Company or the holder of such an award. Immediately after the Effective
Time, each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Option at the Effective Time,
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the unexercised portion of such
option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number. The exercise price per share of each such assumed Company Option
shall be equal to the exercise price of such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. The term, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, and all other terms of the Company
Options shall otherwise remain unchanged. It is the intention of the parties
that the Company Options so assumed by Parent qualify following the
Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the
Code to the extent such Company Options qualified as incentive stock options
prior to the Effective Time.



(b) _401(k) Plans_. Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, Company and its subsidiaries, as applicable, shall each terminate any
and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless
Parent provides written notice to Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not
be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to Company, no
later than two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
(effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant
to resolutions of Companys Board of Directors. The form and substance of
such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k)
Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require.



(c) _ESPP_. The rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to
any offering then underway under the Company ESPP shall be determined by
treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time as the last day of
such offering and by making such other pro rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering but otherwise treating such
shortened offering as a fully effective and completed offering for all
purposes under the Company ESPP. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock shall be exercised in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Company ESPP, and each share of Company Common Stock purchased
pursuant to such exercise shall by virtue of the Merger, and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio,
without issuance of certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock to participants under the Company ESPP. As of the
Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall be terminated. Prior to the Effective
Time,  



 

-50-  Company shall (i) provide Parent with evidence that the Company ESPP has
been terminated pursuant to resolutions of Companys Board of Directors,
and the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to prior
review and approval of Parent, and (ii) take such other actions (including,
but not limited to, if appropriate, amending the Company ESPP) that are
necessary to give effect to the transaction contemplated by this Section
5.9(c). Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to provide to employees of
Company who continue their employment with Company following the Effective
Time the opportunity to enroll in a special offering period under Parents
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which special offering period shall commence as
soon as is administratively practicable following the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such special offering period shall not commence
in the event the next regularly scheduled offering period under Parents
Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall commence within six (6) weeks following the
Effective Time.



(d) _Certain Employee Benefits_. As soon as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, Company and Parent shall confer and work together in good
faith to agree upon mutually acceptable employee benefit and compensation
arrangements for employees of Company and its subsidiaries following the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that Company employees will receive comparable
employee benefit and compensation arrangements to similarly situated Parent
employees. Employees of Company and its subsidiaries will be granted credit
for all service with Company, its subsidiaries or its affiliates (except to
the extent such service credit will result in the duplication of benefits)
under each current employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent or
its affiliates in which such employees are eligible to participate for
purposes of eligibility and vesting, except for purposes of Parents benefit
accrual under Parent retirement plans. If employees become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental or vision plan of Parent or its affiliates,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such plan to (i)
waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting period limitations for
conditions covered under the applicable medical, dental or vision plans
maintained or contributed to by Company (but only to the extent corresponding
exclusions and limitations were satisfied by such employees under the
applicable medical, dental or health plans maintained or contributed to by
Company) and (ii) credit any deductible or out of pocket expenses incurred by
the employees and their beneficiaries under such plans during the portion of
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.



5.10 _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file, if available for use by Parent, a
registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options within ten (10)
business days following the Closing.



5.11 _Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be maintained in
effect in all respects the current obligations of Company pursuant to
any indemnification agreements between Company and its directors and officers
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and any indemnification
provisions under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date
hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the indemnified  



 

-51-  parties thereunder (the "Indemnified Parties") as those contained in the
Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is
required by law.



(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available, directors and
officers liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered
by Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms
comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate for such
coverage in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by Company, it
being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount.



(c) This Section 5.11 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
respective successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor
the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. 



5.12 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to be
reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger to be authorized for
listing by Nasdaq, upon official notice of issuance.



5.13 _Affiliates_. Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent a Company Affiliate Agreement from
each person Company reasonably determines, after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing Date, to be a Company Affiliate, as promptly as practicable on or
following the date of such determination.



5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parents and Company
shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable law and no action letters thereunder) to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article I by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



5.15 _Regulatory Filings_. As soon as may be reasonably practicable, Company
and Parent each shall file with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the "FTC") and the Antitrust



 

-52- Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and
Report Forms relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by
the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by
the merger notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable
jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. Company and Parent each shall
promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may be required in
order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional information
which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or
merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which the parties may
reasonably deem appropriate, to the extent that applicable laws provide.
Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement, each of Company and Parent shall consult with
the other party prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing,
shall permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and
proposals before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental
Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with any
investigations or proceedings in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including under any antitrust or fair trade
Legal Requirement), coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging
such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies
of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that
with respect to any such filing, presentation or submission, each of Parent
and Company need not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or, in
case of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that any law, treaty,
rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party
requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information.



5.16 _Parent Board Designees_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause one
individual designated by Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent (the
"Company Designee") to be elected or appointed to the board of directors of
Parent (the "Parent Board") and shall take all actions necessary under the
Parent Charter Documents, including by expanding the number of authorized
directors on the Parent Board, in order to accomplish the foregoing.



5.17 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all
of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub
shall not engage in any business other than in connection with the Merger.

such reference shall be deemed to include the business of all direct and
indirect subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to the subsidiaries of an
entity shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such
entity.



(b) For purposes of this Agreement:



(i) the term "knowledge" means with respect to a party hereto, with respect
to any matter in question, the actual knowledge of the executive officers of
such party after reasonable inquiry of their respective direct reports;



(ii) the term "Material Adverse Effect" when used in connection with an entity
shall mean any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect
(each an "Effect") that, individually or in the aggregate, is, or is
reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to (x) the business, assets
(including intangible assets), liabilities, capitalization, financial
condition or results of operations of the entity taken as a whole, (y) or the
ability of such entity to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a timely manner; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in the case of
clause (x), in no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination,
be deemed to constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account
in determining whether there has occurred, a Material Adverse Effect: any
adverse Effect (A) primarily resulting from the announcement and pendency of
this Agreement (including stockholder litigation relating thereto) or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) resulting
from changes affecting the United States or world economy generally, (C)
resulting from changes affecting the industry in which such entity operates
generally (which changes, in the case of (B) and (C), do not materially
disproportionately affect such entity), and (D) resulting from a change in an
entitys stock price or trading volume of such entity; _provided_ that clause
(D) shall not exclude any underlying effect  



 

-62-  which may have caused such change in stock price or trading volume; and,
_provided_ _further_ , that clause (A) shall not be applicable to
Effects related to breaches or inaccuracies in the representations or
warranties the specific subject matter of which is the effectuation or effect
of the Merger itself; and



(iii) the term "person" shall mean any individual, corporation (including any
non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any
limited liability company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise,

8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.



8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Schedule and the
Parent Schedule, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and

Person (including any party hereto) shall have any rights or remedies,
including rights of enforcement, with respect thereto and no employee of
Company or any of its subsidiaries or other Person is or is intended to be
a third-party beneficiary thereof.



8.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a legal, valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
illegal, void or unenforceable provision.



8.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.



 

-63- 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, and hereby further agrees that

assert or plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such
jurisdiction, venue and process.



8.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. __



8.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and

referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
