**(b)** The  Seller understands that the Seller Notes and the shares of
Purchaser Common  Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes
have not been registered  under the Securities Act or under the securities
laws of any jurisdiction,  by  reason of reliance upon certain exemptions,
and that the reliance of the  Purchaser on such exemptions is predicated upon
the accuracy of the Seller's  representations and warranties in this
Agreement.

 

 

**(c)** The  Seller has had the opportunity to ask questions of and receive
answers from  representatives of the Purchaser and to obtain additional

factors contained  therein.

 

 

**(d)** The  Seller understands that the Seller Notes and the shares of
Purchaser Common  Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are
characterized as  "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws

regulations, such shares  may  be transferred or resold without registration
under the Securities Act only  in  certain limited circumstances and in
accordance with the terms and conditions  set forth in the legend described
in Section 2.5(e) below. The Seller is  familiar with Rule 144 promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission  (the " _SEC_ "),  as  presently in
effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby  and  by the
Securities Act. The Seller will observe and comply with the Securities  Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, as now in effect and as from 
time  to time amended and including those hereafter enacted or promulgated,
in  connection with any offer, sale, exchange, transfer, pledge or other
disposition  of the Seller Notes, the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
issuable upon  conversion of the Convertible Notes or any part thereof.

Securities Act, ( _ii_ )  pursuant to an effective registration statement or
( _iii_ )  pursuant to an exemption provided by the Securities Act. The
Purchaser, at  its  discretion, may cause stop transfer orders to be placed
with its transfer agent  with respect to the certificates representing such
Purchaser Common Stock as  to  which such legend is applicable.

deciding whether or  not  to acquire the Company.

 

 

All  the  foregoing Contracts, including all amendments or modifications
thereto, all  Real  Estate Leases (as hereinafter defined) and all IP
Licenses (as hereinafter  defined) are sometimes collectively referred to as
" _Material  Contracts_." The  Company has furnished to the Purchaser true
and correct copies of all Material  Contracts (or reasonable descriptions of
the material terms thereof, in the  case  of oral Contracts). Each written
Material Contract sets forth the entire  agreement and understanding between
the Company and/or each Subsidiary and  the  other parties thereto, and each
description of an oral Material Contract sets  forth the material terms of
such Material Contract. Each Material Contract  is  valid, binding and in
full force and effect. There is no event or condition  which has occurred or
exists which constitutes or which, with or without notice,  the happening of
any event and/or the passage of time, could constitute a  default or breach
under any such Material Contract by the Company and/or any  Subsidiary or, to
the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, any other party  thereto, or
could cause the acceleration of any obligation or loss of any rights  of any
party thereto or give rise to any right of termination or cancellation 
thereof. Except as set forth on **_Schedule  3.9_** ,  all  payments
currently due under Material Contracts have been duly paid in  accordance
with the terms thereof, and the Company and the Seller have no  knowledge
that the parties to any Material Contract will not fulfill their  obligations
thereunder in all material respects. Except as set forth on  ** _Schedule 
3.9_** ,  ( _x_ )  the  Transactions will not afford any other Party the
right to terminate any Material  Contract, and ( _y_ )  none of  the
Material Contracts contains any "change of control" or other similar 
provisions triggered by the consummation of the Transactions. Prior to the 
Closing, all Contracts between the Company or any Subsidiary and Cavan or
any  Affiliate of Cavan shall have been terminated, except for those
Contracts  specifically identified as not so terminating on **_Schedule 
3.9_** ,  and  Cavan or such Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have fully
released the  Company and the Subsidiaries.

full force and effect and, except as set forth on  ** _Schedule  3.10(a)_**
,  no  claim has been made under any such Title Policy, and, to the
knowledge of the  Seller and the Company, there is no current fact or
information which would  result in a claim or constitute a defense by the
issuer of any such Title Policy  or an exclusion from coverage. True and
correct copies of all such Title  Policies and the Title Commitment (together
with copies of all documents  referenced in the Title Commitment as
exceptions to title) have been delivered  by the Company to Purchaser. Except
as specifically reflected or described  on  ** _Schedule  3.10(a)_** , 
no  Association or Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other
Person  owns, leases or has any other interest in the Real Property or any
other  property or asset (real, personal or mixed) used in the Business. The

when filed. As of their respective dates,  the Purchaser Reports did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact  or  omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to  make  the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading. The " _Purchaser  Reports_ " means  ( _a_ )  the 
Purchaser's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31,  2005, as filed with the SEC, and ( _b_ )  all  other reports filed by

**(b)** Except  as  set forth on **_Schedule  4.5(b)_** ,  each of  the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into 
the Purchaser Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly 
presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the 
Purchaser as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
operations,  cash flows and stockholders' equity included in or incorporated

accordance with GAAP consistently  applied during the periods involved,
except as noted therein and, in the case  of  unaudited statements, except

obligations or liabilities of any nature, whether accrued,  absolute,
contingent or otherwise, of the Purchaser, other than those  liabilities and
obligations ( _i_ )  that  are disclosed or otherwise reflected or reserved

business, assets or financial condition.

in connection with  the  preparation and filing of the Purchaser's most
recent Quarterly Report on Form  10-Q, the Purchaser has no knowledge of (i)
any significant deficiencies or  material weaknesses in the design or
operation of the Purchaser's internal  control over financial reporting that
are likely to adversely affect the  Purchaser's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data; or  (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other  employees who have a role in the
Purchaser's internal control over financial  reporting.

investor" within the meaning of Regulation D under  the Securities Act. The
Purchaser understands that the sale of the Securities  has not been
registered under the Securities Act or under the securities laws  of  any
jurisdiction, by reason of reliance upon certain exemptions, and that the 
reliance of the Seller on such exemptions is predicated upon the accuracy of 
the  Purchaser's representations and warranties in this Agreement. The
Purchaser  understands that the Securities are characterized as "restricted
securities" under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being
acquired from  the  Seller in a transaction not involving a public offering,
and that, under such  laws and applicable regulations, such Securities may be
transferred or resold  without registration under the Securities Act only in
certain limited  circumstances. The Purchaser will observe and comply with
the Securities Act  and  the rules and regulations thereunder, as now in
effect and as from time to  time  amended and including those hereafter
enacted or promulgated, in connection  with  any offer, sale, exchange,
transfer, pledge or other disposition of the  Securities or any part thereof.
The Purchaser is acquiring the Securities for  its own account for investment
only, and not with a view to, or for sale in  connection with, any
distribution of the Securities in violation of the  Securities Act, any rule
or regulation under the Securities Act, or any state  securities laws.

suit, proceeding or investigation  is  pending or, to the Purchaser's
knowledge, threatened against the Purchaser or,  to the Purchaser's
knowledge, against any stockholder, member, officer,  director, manager or
employee of the Purchaser which, if determined adversely,  could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability  of  the
Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

**4.8. ****Sufficient  Funds.**   The  Purchaser will have available at the
Closing sufficient funds available to  pay  the Cash Consideration and to
perform its other obligations pursuant to this  Agreement.

Stockholder Approval, the Purchaser has reserved and will  reserve sufficient
shares of Purchaser Common Stock to issue upon conversion  of  the
Convertible Notes. The Purchaser Common Stock issuable upon conversion  of 
the Convertible Notes, when so issued, will ( _a_ )  be duly  authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive  rights
granted by the Purchaser, ( _b_ )  not be  issued in violation of the terms
of any Contract to which the Purchaser is  a  party, and ( _c_ )  be 
issued in compliance with the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation  and by-laws of the Purchaser and all applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

 

**4.10. ****Disclosure.**   The  representations and warranties of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement,  taken as a whole, do not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or  omit  to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained  herein and therein not
misleading.

Company, Cavan and  the  Seller will promptly disclose to the Purchaser all

by the Seller, unless the Seller  or  Cavan participates in or directs such
action by any such member of the  Seller.

keep confidential, except ( _a_ )  for  information that is lawfully and
independently obtained by Cavan or the Seller  from a third party without
restrictions as to disclosure by Cavan or the Seller,  ( _b_ )  for 
information that enters the public domain through no fault of Cavan or the 
Seller, ( _c_ )  for  information that is independently developed by Cavan
or the Seller without  reference to confidential or proprietary information
of the Company or the  Subsidiaries, ( _d_ )  to the  extent that such
information shall have become public knowledge other than  by  breach of
this Agreement by Cavan or the Seller, ( _e_ )  as  required in connection
with the performance of Cavan's duties as an employee or  an independent
contractor of the Company, ( _f_ )  as  required to file Tax returns and

action against any legally required  disclosure).

 

 

**5.7. ****Non-competition.**

 

 

**(a)** During  the Non-competition Period (as hereinafter defined), ( _i_
)  neither  Cavan nor the Seller shall, directly or indirectly, or as a
stockholder,  partner, member, manager, employee, consultant or other owner
or participant  in  any Person other than the Company, engage in or assist
any other Person to  engage in any Covered Business (as hereinafter defined)
within 100 miles of  any  boundary of the Company Property, ( _ii_ ) 
neither  Cavan nor the Seller shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or
endeavor to  entice away from the Company, or offer employment or a

relationship of the Company with,  any  Person who is, or was within the
one-year period prior to the Closing, an  employee of or consultant to the
Company and ( _iii_ )  neither  Cavan nor the Seller shall, directly or
indirectly, solicit or endeavor to  entice away from the Company, endeavor to
reduce the business conducted with  the  Company by, or otherwise interfere
with the business relationship of the Company  with, any Person who is, or
was within the one-year period prior to the Closing,  a customer or client
of, supplier, vendor or service provider to, or other  Person having business
relations with, the Company. Nothing in this Section  5.7(a) shall be
construed to prohibit Cavan or the Seller from engaging the  same  third
party contractors as the Company if such engagement does not materially 
interfere with the performance of any such Person's obligations under a
Contract  with the Company.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(b)** In  the  event that the Seller or Cavan begins to consider the
acquisition, directly  or  indirectly, of any ownership interest in any
Covered Business outside of the  100-mile boundary of the Company Property
during the Non-Competition Period,  the  Seller or Cavan, as the case may
be, shall deliver to the Purchaser a  preliminary written notice describing
the summary terms of such acquisition,  to  the extent then known. In the
event that the Seller or Cavan proposes, directly  or indirectly, to acquire
any ownership interest in any Covered Business outside  of the 100-mile
boundary of the Company Property during the Non-Competition  Period, the
Seller or Cavan, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Purchaser  a
written notice (the " _Offer  Notice_ "),  which  Offer Notice will provide
all material information about such proposed  acquisition (including the
amount of funds required to complete such  acquisition) and offer the
Purchaser the right to acquire the Covered Business  at the Purchaser's
election. Following delivery of the Offer Notice, the Seller  or Cavan, as
the case may be, shall promptly provide such additional materials  and
information as to such Covered Business as the Purchaser shall reasonably 
request. If the Purchaser notifies the Seller or Cavan within 20 days of the 
Purchaser's receipt of the Offer Notice that it wishes to participate in
such  acquisition (the " _Purchaser  Notice_ "),  then  the Seller or
Cavan, as the case may be, and the Purchaser shall use reasonable  efforts to
effect the Purchaser's participation in such acquisition and shall  negotiate
in good faith the terms under which the Purchaser would retain Cavan  to
manage the development and operation of such Covered Business and the terms 
of the "carried interest" to be provided to Cavan in connection therewith in
the  profits from the Covered Business after repayment of capital and a
reasonable  return thereon. If the Seller and Cavan, as the case may be, and
the Purchaser  are not able in good faith to reach final agreement on
agreements to govern  their relationship with respect to the Covered Business
within 60 days following  delivery of the Purchaser Notice, then the Seller
or Cavan, as the case may  be,  shall be free to acquire the Covered
Business for its own account within the  60  days thereafter substantially
on the terms set forth in the Offer Notice;  _provided_   that if  such
acquisition is not consummated within such 60-day period on such terms, 
the  Seller or Cavan, as the case may be, shall be required to offer such
acquisition  to the Purchaser in accordance with this Section 5.7(b).

 

 

**(c)** For  purposes of this Section 5.7, the following terms shall have the
following  meanings:

 

 

" _Company_ " shall  include the Company, each of its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries and all of  their respective successors and assigns.

 

 

" _Covered  Business_ " shall  mean the development of a real estate
project that includes a golf course,  together with either time shares or
fractional interests in residential  improvements or residential lots, as
components of such project; _provided_   that "Covered Business" will not
include any projects in which the Seller or Cavan is  currently involved or

time from the date hereof to the  Closing Date, which would require any

Purchaser Common Stock  issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or
any part thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any Seller

the Convertible Notes being  transferred shall not consummate such transfer
until ( _a_ )  the  prospective transferee has confirmed to the Purchaser in
writing its agreement  to be bound by the provisions of this Section 5.15 and
made the representations  and warranties set forth in Section 2.5 and ( _b_
)  the  Purchaser shall have received a legal opinion reasonably acceptable

monetization arrangement or hedging or similar transaction) which  has the
effect of transferring any or all of the economic benefits of ownership  of
any Purchaser Common Stock, or any securities convertible into any such 
common stock, and will not announce an intention to do any of the  foregoing.

 

 

**ARTICLE  6**

Section 8.2 to be satisfied as soon as  practicable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**6.2. ****Confidentiality.**   Pending  the Closing, all proprietary
information obtained by the Purchaser from or  on  behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the Seller will be kept  confidential and will not

)  is  lawfully and independently obtained by the Purchaser from a third
party without  restriction as to disclosure by the Purchaser, ( _b_ )  was 
known by the Purchaser prior to its disclosure by or on behalf of the

the foregoing, the  Purchaser shall be permitted to make such disclosures as
are required by the  SEC  in connection with the Proxy Statement. If this
Agreement is terminated, and  if  requested in writing by the Company, the
Purchaser will cause to be delivered  to  the Company all materials obtained
by the Purchaser from or on behalf of the  Company or its Subsidiaries or the
Seller, whether obtained before or after  the  date of this Agreement.

Statement, the Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary 
form of the Proxy Statement, and other proxy materials related thereto, with 
respect to the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting. As promptly as reasonably 
practicable after comments are received from the SEC thereon, if any, and
after  such comments are resolved to the satisfaction of the SEC, or if the
SEC has  indicated that it does not intend to review the Proxy Statement and
the  applicable period for review by the SEC shall have lapsed, the Purchaser
shall  give notice of and hold the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting; _provided_
  that the  Purchaser shall have no obligation to mail the Proxy Statement
and give notice  of the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting unless and until the
Purchaser's financial  advisor shall have delivered a written opinion dated
on or about the date of  such mailing to the effect that the Transactions are
fair to the Purchaser  from  a financial point of view and that the fair
value of the Company is equal to  at  least 80% of the net assets of the
Purchaser (excluding the amounts held in  the  Purchaser's trust fund
representing a portion of the underwriters' discount in  connection with the
Purchaser's initial public offering) (the " _Fairness  Opinion_ ").  To 
the extent not inconsistent with Legal Requirements or the fiduciary duties 
of  the Purchaser's board of directors, the Proxy Statement shall include
the  recommendation of the Purchaser's board of directors that its
stockholders vote  in favor of the Transactions. If, at any time prior to the
Purchaser Stockholder  Meeting, an event shall occur relating to the
Purchaser, the Company or the  Transactions that should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the  Proxy Statement, the Purchaser shall
promptly prepare, file with the SEC and  mail such amendment or supplement.
The Purchaser shall consult with the Company  and the Seller with respect to

incorporation.

 

 

**6.7. ****Notification  of Certain Matters.** The  Purchaser shall promptly

occur, of any event which occurrence or failure would  be likely to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement  to  be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof  to the
Closing Date; ( _b_ )  any  failure of the Purchaser or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof,  to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied  with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; ( _c_ )  any  material adverse change that shall have occurred or
have been threatened in  the  financial condition, results of operations,
business or assets of the Purchaser;  and ( _d_ )  any  litigation, or of

a representative designated by the Seller, who shall  be  reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser, to attend all meetings of the board  of 
directors of the Purchaser in a non-voting capacity and to participate in 
matters brought to the board of directors; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
( _a_ )  the  Purchaser may exclude such representative from access to any
material or meeting  or portion thereof if the Company believes that such
exclusion is reasonably  necessary to preserve the attorney-client privilege,
to protect highly  confidential proprietary information or for other similar
reasons and  ( _b_ )  such  representative shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the  Purchaser, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the  Purchaser.

 

 

**6.9. ****Release  of Guarantees**.  The  Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Seller in  obtaining the termination of the
guarantees, indemnities or other financial  assurances by Cavan or its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the  Subsidiaries) of Permitted
Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company  or  any Subsidiary set
forth on **_Schedule  6.9_**   (the " _Cavan  Guarantees_ ");  _provided_
  that  nothing herein shall require the Purchaser to pay any amounts or
agree to any  amendments or modifications of the Contracts relating to such
Permitted  Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary
in connection  with the obtaining of such terminations of the Cavan
Guarantees. The Purchaser  agrees to indemnify Cavan or its Affiliates (other
than the Company or any  Subsidiary), as the case may be, that is a party to
any guarantee, indemnity  or  other financial assurance of Permitted
Indebtedness or other obligations of  the  Company or any Subsidiary,
whether or not listed on **_Schedule  6.9_** ,  from  and against all
amounts payable thereunder;  _provided_   that the  Purchaser shall be
obligated to indemnify Cavan or its Affiliates pursuant  to  this Section
6.9 only with respect to the Cavan Guarantees and other guarantees, 
indemnities and financial assurances that relate to obligations of the
Company  or a Subsidiary pursuant to Contracts that have been disclosed on
**_Schedule  3.9_** ;  and  _provided_   further  that the Purchaser
shall not be obligated to indemnify Cavan or its Affiliates  from any Losses
for which the Seller has an indemnity obligation under Article  10.

**ARTICLE  7**

 

**TAX  COVENANTS**

 

 

**7.1. ****Consistent  Tax Reporting.**   The  parties hereto agree that
the purchase of the Securities by the Purchaser is  properly treated as the
purchase of the Company's assets and those of any  Subsidiary limited
liability company in which the Company is the sole member.  Inasmuch as the
Purchaser will file a consolidated federal income tax return  with respect to
any Subsidiary that is classified as an association taxable  as a 
corporation for federal income tax purposes, the taxable year of any
Subsidiary  corporation will close at the close of business on the Closing
Date. The Seller,  the Company and the Purchaser shall treat and report the
Transactions for  purposes of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax in all
respects  consistently with the provisions of Section 1.4, this Section 7.1
and any other  provision of this Agreement that specifies an intended Tax
treatment or  reporting position.

 

 

**7.2. ****Tax  Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date**.  The 
Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed 
all  Tax Returns of the Company and all Subsidiaries for taxable periods
ending  on or  before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing  Taxable Periods_
")  which  have not been filed prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Seller shall permit  the Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the  prior sentence at least ten (10) days prior to
filing and shall make such  revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by Purchaser, to  the  extent such revisions are consistent with
the terms of this Agreement. All  Tax  Returns to be prepared by or for the
Seller pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall  be prepared in a manner consistent
with the past practice of the Company, except  as otherwise required by law.
The Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes  of  the Company or any
Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods to the extent  due and payable
prior to the Closing and shall pay to (or as directed by) the  Company any
such Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary to the extent such  Taxes  have
not already been paid by the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Seller prior 
to the Closing, and such payments shall be made no later than five (5)
business  days prior to the due date for paying such amount of Taxes to the
relevant  tax  authority. The provisions of this Section 7.2 shall not limit
the rights of  the  Purchaser for a breach of representations or warranties
made in Section 3.19  of  this Agreement.

 

 

**7.3. ****Tax  Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date.**
  The  Company shall cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of the
Company  and  all Subsidiaries for taxable periods which begin before the
Closing Date and  end  after the Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**7.4. ****Cooperation  on Tax Matters**.

 

 

**(a)** The  Purchaser, the Company and the Seller shall cooperate fully, to
the extent  reasonably requested, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant  to  Sections 7.2 and 7.3 or otherwise, and any audit,
litigation, or other  proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention  and (upon the other party's request) the
provision of records and information  which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return filing, audit, litigation,  or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient  basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided  hereunder.

 

 

**(b)** The  Seller agrees ( _i_ )  to  provide to the Company, upon
request, all books and records with respect to  Tax  matters pertinent to
the Company in the possession of the Seller relating to  any  taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the  statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Company, any  extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all  record-
retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority, and  ( _ii_ )  to
give  the Company reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or  discarding any such books and records and, if the Company so requests,
the  Seller shall allow the Company to take possession of such books and
records.  If  the Seller delivers its or the Company's books and records to
the Purchaser,  then the Purchaser shall thereafter make such books and
records available during  normal business hours to the Seller in a manner
consistent with the provisions  of this Article 7, upon reasonable prior
notice.

 

 

**(c)** If  requested by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller will
cooperate with  the  Purchaser to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental  or  Regulatory Authority or any other Person as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce  or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
upon the Company or any Subsidiary  (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the Transactions).

 

 

**7.5. ****Control  of Audits**.  After  the Closing Date, except as set
forth in the next sentence, the Company shall  control the conduct, through
counsel of its own choosing, of any audit, claim  for refund, or
administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted  Tax  liability
or refund with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  (each, a "
_Contest_ ").  In  the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates
solely to Pre-Closing  Tax Periods, the Seller shall control the conduct of
such Contest, but the  Company shall have the right to participate in such
Contest at its own expense,  and Seller shall not settle, compromise and/or
concede any portion of such  Contest that could affect the Tax liability of
the Company or its Subsidiaries  for any taxable year (or portion thereof)
after the Closing Date without the  written consent of Company, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld;  _provided_   that, if  the Seller fails to
assume control of the conduct of any such Contest within  30  days following
the receipt by the Seller of notice of such Contest, the Company  shall have
the right to assume control of such Contest and shall be able to  settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest.

 

 

**7.6. ****Certain  Taxes.**   All  transfer, documentary, sales, use, real
property gains, stamp, registration,  transaction privilege and other such
Taxes and fees incurred as a result of  the  Transactions shall be paid by
the Seller when due, and the Company will, at  the  Seller's expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with  respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains,  stamp, registration,
transaction privilege and other Taxes and fees, and, if  required by
applicable law, the Purchaser and the Seller will join in the  execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

**10.2. ****Indemnification  Limits.**   If the  Closing occurs, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties (as hereinafter defined)  shall  not be
entitled to recover any Losses (as hereinafter defined) for breaches  of 
the representations and warranties of the Seller and/or the Company
contained  herein ( _a_ )  unless  and until the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties' aggregate claims therefor exceed  $250,000, at which time the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled  to  recover Losses for all
claims in excess of such amount (except that claims  for  breach of any
representation or warranty that is subject to Material Adverse  Effect or
other materiality qualifier shall not be subject to the terms of  this 
clause (a) and, subject to all other applicable limitations in this Article 
10,  the Purchaser shall be allowed to recover for all Losses related
thereto),  or  ( _b_ )  absent  fraud or willful misconduct, for an
aggregate amount in excess of $8,500,000;  _provided_   that  claims for
breach of any of the Specified Representations by the Seller or  the 
Company shall not be subject to the foregoing limits (but shall instead be 
subject to and not exceed the total consideration paid to the Seller) and
shall  not be included in the determination of whether the limit in clause
(b) has  been  reached. Notwithstanding the limitations on indemnification
set forth in Section  10.1 and this Section 10.2, such limitations shall not
apply to any claim  against the Seller for breach of any representation or
warranty that to the  knowledge of the Seller or the Company was inaccurate
at Closing and which  breach was not previously disclosed to the Purchaser in
writing prior to the  Closing. For all purposes of this Article 10, when
determining the amount of  the  Losses, any Material Adverse Effect or other
materiality qualifier in any such  representation or warranty will be
disregarded. No Indemnifier shall have any  indemnification obligation for (
_x_ )  punitive damages, except, in all cases, all such damages that are
payable by  the  Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with a
third-party claim or  ( _y_ )  any  indirect damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable or ( _z_ )  any  damages resulting from positions
taken by the Purchaser, the Company or any  Subsidiary on any Tax Returns
filed by them for any post-closing tax period,  even if such positions are
the same or similar to positions taken on Tax Returns  filed by Seller, the
Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Taxable  Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Purchaser  Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses for breaches  of  the
representations and warranties of the Seller and/or the Company to the 
extent based on facts and circumstances that constitute New Matters
explicitly  reflected in the Updated Disclosure Schedules, if any, unless and
until the  Purchaser Indemnified Parties' aggregate claims therefor exceed
$250,000, at  which time the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to recover Losses  for all claims in excess of such amount subject to the
other terms of this  Article 10. For clarity, delivery of the Updated
Disclosure Schedules shall  have  no effect other than as provided in the
immediately preceding  sentence.

then subject to applicable limitations set forth in this  Agreement,
including, without limitation, the provisions and limitations in  this 
Article 10, the Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its
Affiliates  (the " _Purchaser  Indemnified Parties_ ")  harmless from and

of any nature (collectively, " _Losses_ ")  arising out of, resulting from or
relating to ( _a_ )  any  breach or violation, or the inaccuracy, of any of
the representations or  warranties of the Seller and/or the Company set forth
in this Agreement  (including the schedules) or in any certificate or
document delivered pursuant  to this Agreement, ( _b_ )  any  breach or
violation of the covenants or agreements of the Company set forth  in  this
Agreement required to be performed prior to or at the Closing,  ( _c_ ) 
any  breach or violation of covenants or agreements of the Seller contained
herein,  including without limitation those set forth in Article 7, ( _d_ ) 
the  failure of any portion of the Seller's Expenses or Transaction
Liabilities to be  paid at Closing, ( _e_ )  any  Lien on any property or
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary after the  Closing as a result of
matters existing or relating to any period prior to  the  Closing (other
than Liens approved by the prior written consent of the Purchaser  or Liens
arising as a result of the Company's failure after the Closing to make 
payments first due after Closing required under any Material Contracts
listed  on  ** _Schedule  3.9_**   or  entered into in accordance with
this Agreement), or ( _f_ )  any  litigation, suit, proceeding, arbitration,
audit by the Service or other taxing  authority or investigation with respect
to the affairs of the Company or any  Subsidiary prior to the Closing,
including without limitation any matter  described on **_Schedule 
3.19(b)_**   and  ** _Schedule  3.20_**.

then subject to applicable limitations set forth in this  Agreement,
including, without limitation, the provisions and limitations in  this 
Article 10, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its
Affiliates  harmless from and against all Losses arising out of, resulting
from or relating  to ( _a_ )  any  breach or violation, or the inaccuracy,
of any of the representations or  warranties of the Purchaser set forth in
this Agreement or in any certificate  or  document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, ( _b_ )  any  breach or violation of the covenants or
agreements of the Purchaser set forth  in  this Agreement required to be
performed prior to or at the Closing, or  ( _c_ )  any  breach or
violations of covenant or agreements of the Purchaser contained  herein. The
Seller shall not be entitled to recover any Losses for breach of  the 
representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained herein ( _i_ ) 
unless  and until the Seller's aggregate claims therefor exceed $250,000, at
which time  the Seller shall be entitled to recover Losses for all claims in
excess of  such  amount, or ( _ii_ )  absent  fraud or willful misconduct,
for an aggregate amount in excess of $8,500,000;  _provided_ ,  that 
claims for breach of any of the Specified Representations made by the
Purchaser  shall not be subject to the foregoing limits and shall not be
included in the  determination of whether the limit in clause (ii) has been
reached.

 

 

**10.5. ****Procedures  for Indemnification of Third Party Claims.**

 

 

**(a)** A  party  or parties entitled to indemnification hereunder with
respect to a third party  claim (the " _Indemnified  Party_ ")  will  give
the party or parties required to provide such indemnification (the "
_Indemnifier_ ")  prompt  written notice of any legal proceeding, claim or
demand instituted by any third  party (in each case, a " _Claim_ ")  in 
respect of which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification 
hereunder.

 

 

**(b)** If  the  Indemnifier provides written notice to the Indemnified
Party stating that the  Indemnifier is responsible for the entire Claim
within 10 days after the  Indemnifier's receipt of written notice from the
Indemnified Party of such  Claim, the Indemnifier shall have the right, at
the Indemnifier's expense, to  defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with such Claim and to  have  the Indemnified Party represented by
counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the  Indemnified Party, selected by the
Indemnifier, if the _ad  damnum_   is less  than or equal to the amount of
Losses for which the Indemnifier is liable under  this Article 10; _provided_
  that the  Indemnifier may not assume control of the defense of a suit or
proceeding  involving criminal liability or in which equitable relief is
sought against  the  Indemnified Party; _provided_ _further_ ,  that  the
Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding with counsel of its 
choice and at its expense; _provided_ _further_ ,  that  the Purchaser, at
any time when it believes in good faith that any Claim is  having or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, may  assume the
defense and settlement of such Claim in good faith, with counsel  of  its
choice, and be fully indemnified for the amount of Losses incurred in such 
defense or settlement to the extent provided in this Article 10; and 
_provided_ _further_ ,  that  the Indemnifier may not enter into a
settlement of any Claim without the written  consent of the Indemnified Party
unless such settlement provides the Indemnified  Party with a full release
from such Claim and requires no more than a monetary  payment for which the
Indemnified Party is fully indemnified. Without limiting  any other remedy
the Purchaser may have at law or in equity, the Purchaser  shall  be
entitled to enforce this Section 10.5 pursuant to the terms of the Escrow 
Agreement. For clarity, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article  10, the procedures set forth in Article 7 shall govern the matters
covered  by  Article 7 to the extent the provisions of this Article 10 are
inconsistent  with  those of Article 7.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(c)** The  parties will cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense  of  any Claim.

 

 

**10.6. ****Right  of Set-Off.** If  the  Seller has not satisfied in cash
any indemnification obligation owed by the  Seller hereunder, the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates may, at their  discretion, satisfy the unpaid
portion of such obligation by, to the extent  permitted by law, setting-off
against any amounts due and owing from the  Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to any of the Seller; _provided_   that the  Purchaser has first
used commercially reasonable efforts to recover such amount  from the Escrow
Fund, if available; and _provided_ _further_   that the  Purchaser shall not
be entitled to set-off pursuant to this Section 10.6 against  any amounts due
pursuant to the Management Contract. Any amounts that the Seller  wishes to
set-off pursuant to this Section 10.6 will, to the extent that the  Purchaser
would otherwise then be required to pay such amount to the Seller,  be 
placed into an escrow account to be held by a Person that is not an
Affiliate  of  any party hereto and will remain therein until ( _a_ )

**11.2. ****Severability  and Governing Law; Forum.**   This  Agreement
shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid  under
applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited or invalid 
under any such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of
such  prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating or nullifying the
remainder  of  such provision or any other provisions of this Agreement. If
any one or more  of  the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for
any reason be held to  be  excessively broad as to duration, geographical
scope, activity or subject,  such  provisions shall be construed by limiting
and reducing it so as to be  enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law. This Agreement  shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of  the  State of Delaware, without regard
to its conflicts of laws principles. Any  proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement may be brought in the  courts of the State of
Delaware, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction,  in  the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware. This provision  may be filed
with any court as written evidence of the knowing and voluntary  irrevocable
agreement between the parties to waive any objections to  jurisdiction, to
venue or to convenience of forum.

 

 

**11.3. ****Amendments,  Waivers.**   This  Agreement may be amended or
modified only with the written consent of the  Purchaser, the Company and the
Seller. No waiver of any term or provision hereof  shall be effective unless
in writing signed by the party waiving such term  or  provision. No failure
to exercise or delay in exercising any right, power or  remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or  partial exercise
of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other  or  further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  The
rights provided hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, 
powers or remedies provided by law.

 

 

**11.4. ****Expenses.**   All  legal and other costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement  and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such costs and  expenses, _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that
if  the Closing occurs the Seller shall be responsible for the Seller's
Expenses and  the Transaction Liabilities.

 

 

**11.5. ****Successors  and Assigns.**   This  Agreement, and all
provisions hereof, shall be binding upon and inure to the  benefit of the
respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto, provided  that this
Agreement may not be assigned by any party without the prior written  consent
of the other parties hereto except that ( _a_ )  the  indemnification and
other rights hereunder of a party may be assigned to any  bank or other
financial institution which is or becomes a lender to the  Purchaser or the
Company or any of their respective successors and assigns  and  ( _b_ ) 
this  Agreement may be assigned by the Purchaser to any of its Affiliates or
to any  Person acquiring a material portion of the assets, business or
securities of  the  Company or Purchaser, whether by merger, consolidation,
sale of assets or  securities or otherwise.

 

 

**11.6. ****Entire  Agreement.**   This  Agreement, the attached exhibits
and schedules, and the other agreements,  documents and instruments
contemplated hereby contain the entire understanding  of the parties, and
there are no further or other agreements or understandings,  written or oral,
in effect between the parties relating to the subject matter  hereof unless
expressly referred to herein. Except for the representations  and 
warranties contained in this Agreement, no party hereto makes any other 
representation or warranty (either express or implied).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**11.7. ****Counterparts.**   This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and with counterpart  facsimile signature pages, each of which
shall be an original, but all of which  when taken together shall constitute
one and the same Agreement.

 

 

**11.8. ****Headings.**   The  headings of Articles and Sections herein are
inserted for convenience of  reference only and shall be ignored in the
construction or interpretation  hereof.

 

 

**11.9. ****Further  Assurances.** Following  the Closing, the parties
hereto will execute and deliver such documents and  take  such other actions
as may be reasonably necessary in order to fully consummate  the
Transactions.

 

 

**11.10.   ** **Third  Party Beneficiaries.** Nothing  in the Agreement
shall be construed to confer any right, benefit or remedy  upon  any Person
that is not a party hereto or a permitted assignee of a party hereto,  except
as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

**11.11.   ** **No  Strict Construction.**   The  parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of  this  Agreement and
the other agreements and documents contemplated herein. In the  event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises under any  provision
of this Agreement or any other agreement or documents contemplated  herein,
this Agreement and such other agreements or documents shall be construed  as
if drafted jointly by the parties thereto, and no presumption or burden  of 
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authoring 
any  of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreements or
documents  contemplated herein.

 

 

**11.12.   ** **Publicity.**   Except  for the press release to be issued
by the Purchaser upon execution of this  Agreement and pending the Closing,
no party shall issue a press release or  make  any other public announcement
concerning the Transactions without the prior  written consent of the
Purchaser and the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that a  party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such a press  release or
make such public disclosure as may upon the advice of counsel be  required by
law if it has used reasonable efforts to consult first with the  other party;
and _provided_ _further_   that  nothing contained herein shall restrict the
ability of the Purchaser to make  such disclosures as may be required under
applicable securities laws, rules  and  regulations and the rules and
regulations of the American Stock Exchange;  _provided_   that the 
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent
practicable,  to provide in advance a copy of the disclosure to the Seller
and give the Seller  a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. This
Section 11.12 shall not limit  the Seller's right or ability, substantially
concurrently with the Purchaser's  press release, to provide written or oral
communications (other than through  a  press release) to the Seller's
members regarding the terms of the Transactions  or to provide written or
oral communications to Persons who have purchased  lots,  Fractional
Interests or Golf Memberships from the Company regarding Cavan's  continuing
role in the management of the Company Property. The Purchaser and  the 
Seller shall cooperate in good faith to determine the timing, manner and
content  of communications under the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 

**11.13.   ** **Schedules  and Exhibits.**   All  schedules and exhibits
to this Agreement are an integral part of this Agreement  and are
incorporated herein by reference in this Agreement for all purposes  of 
this Agreement. All Schedules delivered with this Agreement shall be
arranged  to  correspond with the numbered and lettered Sections and
Subsections contained  in  this Agreement, and the disclosures in such
Schedules shall qualify only the  corresponding Sections and Subsections
contained in this Agreement, unless  otherwise expressly provided herein. The
schedules shall be arranged in sections  and subsections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections and  subsections contained in this Agreement.
The disclosures in any section or  subsection of the schedules shall qualify
only the corresponding section or  subsection of this Agreement and such
other sections or subsections to the  extent expressly cross-referenced or
otherwise expressly stated  therein.

**11.14.   ** **Waiver  of Jury Trial.** EACH  PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER  THIS AGREEMENT IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND  THEREFORE IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY  HAVE  TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING  OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN  CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR THEREBY.

 

 

**11.15.   ** **Limitations  With Respect to Cavan.**   The  designation
of David V. Cavan and Cavan Management Services, L.L.C. as parties  to this
Agreement solely for the purposes of Sections 5.3(b) and 5.5 through  5.11
shall not impose any obligation or liability on Cavan under any other

L.L.C. dated November [__], 2006 (the " _Agreement_ ").

 



 

1. _Principal  and Interest; Maturity_.  This  Note shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof at the rate  of  eight percent (8%) per annum; _provided_   that,  following an Event of Default (as defined below), this Note shall bear  interest  at the default rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum. Interest on the  Note  shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as applicable,  and the  actual number of days elapsed, and all accrued but unpaid interest shall  be  payable semi-annually beginning on **[_____]**   and on  each [______] and [______] thereafter. Subject to prior prepayment in accordance  with the terms hereof, and Section 5(a) hereof and the subordination provisions  herein, Maker shall pay the principal balance of this Note, without set-off,  deduction or counterclaim, together in each case with all accrued and unpaid  interest thereon, on [________] [__], 2010. All payments of principal and  interest on this Note shall be made by Maker in lawful money of the United  States of America in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m.,  Phoenix, Arizona time, on the date such payment is due or, if such date  is not a  business day, then on the next succeeding business day, by wire transfer  to the  bank account designated by Payee in writing to Maker at least three business  days prior to such payment date.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. _Prepayment_.  Maker  shall have the right and privilege of prepaying all or any part of the  principal  of this Note at any time without notice, premium or penalty. All payments  on  this Note shall be applied first, to any outstanding charges hereunder,  and then  to accrued interest, and then to principal.

 



 

3. _Subordination_.  Payee  understands and agrees that all amounts payable under this Note, whether  for  principal, interest or expenses, and the enforcement of Payee\'s rights  in  respect thereof, shall be subordinate and junior to all Senior Indebtedness  (as  defined below). If any default occurs in the payment of the principal of  or  premium or interest on any Senior Indebtedness (whether as a result of  the  acceleration thereof by the holder of any Senior Indebtedness or otherwise)  (a " _Payment  Default_ "),  then  during the continuance of such default and until such payment has been  made or  such default has been cured or waived in writing by the holder of the Senior  Indebtedness, no payment of principal or interest or other amount on this  Note  shall be made by Maker or accepted by Payee and Payee shall not demand  or  exercise remedies to enforce or collect such amounts (but may accelerate  this  Note as provided in clauses (b) through (d) of Section 4 of this Note).  In  addition, no payment of principal or interest or other amount on this Note  shall  be made by Maker or accepted by Payee and Payee shall not demand or exercise  remedies to enforce or collect such amount if the following three conditions  shall exist: ( _i_ )  any  default other than a Payment Default occurs on any Senior Indebtedness,  ( _ii_ )  Payee  has received written notice (" _Default  Notice_ ")  of  such default from Maker or the holder of such Senior Indebtedness and  ( _iii_ )  such  default shall not have been cured by Maker or waived in writing by the  holder of  the Senior Indebtedness and less than 180 days shall have elapsed after  the date  of receipt by Payee of the Default Notice; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  nothing in this sentence shall affect the ability of Payee to accelerate  this  Note as provided in clauses (b) through (d) of Section 4 of this Note.  The term " _Senior  Indebtedness_ " shall  mean money borrowed (including without limitation all principal, interest  (whether or not allowed in a proceeding), fees and all other amounts owing  in  connection therewith) from, or otherwise represented by notes payable to,  a bank  or other financial institution or institution in the business of lending  money  which is secured in whole or in part by any assets or property of Maker  and/or  any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. Any payments received by Payee  in  violation of the foregoing provisions shall be deemed to be held in trust  by  Payee for the benefit of the applicable payee of the Senior Indebtedness.  Payee  agrees, at the request of any payee of Senior Indebtedness, to execute  such  additional documents and instruments which any payee of Senior Indebtedness  may  reasonably request to carry out the foregoing and other customary subordination  provisions. Except as set forth in Section 5(a) hereof, nothing contained  in  this Section 3 or elsewhere in this Note is intended to or shall impair  as  between Maker, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness,  and  Payee, the obligation of Maker, which is unconditional and absolute, to  pay to  Payee the principal of and interest on this Note as and when the same shall  become due and payable in accordance with its terms, or is intended to  or shall  affect the relative rights of Payee and the creditors of Maker other than  the  holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein prevent Payee  from  exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default under this Note, subject to the rights,  if  any, under this Section 3 of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect  of  cash or other property of Maker received upon the exercise of any such  remedy.  Payee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior  Indebtedness. In the event that Maker fails to make a payment on account  of  principal of or interest on or other amounts due in respect of this Note  by  reason of any provision of this Section 3, such failure shall constitute  an  Event of Default hereunder, and the fact that such failure resulted from  the  application of this Section 3 shall not be construed as preventing the  occurrence of, or mitigating, such Event of Default.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. _Events  of Default_.  In each  case of the happening of any of the following events (each of which is  herein  sometimes called an " _Event  of Default_ "):

 



 

(a) default  in the payment of any amount due under this Note for more than
seven (7)  days  after the date when the same shall become due and payable;

 



 

(b) acceleration  of the payment of any principal, interest or applicable
premium, if any,  due,  prior to the stated maturity or payment date
thereof, pursuant to any bond,  debenture, note or other evidence of
indebtedness or under one or more  mortgages, indentures or instruments under
which there may be issued, or  by  which there may be secured or evidenced,
any indebtedness of Maker or any  subsidiary of Maker, whether such
indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter  be  created, in an aggregate
amount which exceeds $5,000,000;

 



 

(c) Maker  ( _i_ )  is  unable or admits in writing its inability to pay
its monetary obligations  as  they become due, ( _ii_ )  makes a  general
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or ( _iii_ )  applies  for,
consents to, or acquiesces in, the appointment of a trustee, receiver,  or 
other custodian for itself or its property or any part thereof, or in the 
absence of such application, consent, or acquiescence a trustee, receiver, 
or  other custodian is appointed for Maker or its property or any part
thereof,  and  such appointment is not discharged within ninety days; or

 



 

(d) Commencement  of any case under the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the
United State Code,  or  commencement of any other bankruptcy arrangement,
reorganization, receivership,  custodianship, or similar proceeding under any
federal, state, or foreign  law by  or against Maker and with respect to any
such case or proceeding that is  involuntary, such case or proceeding is not
dismissed within ninety days  of the  filing thereof;

 



 

then,  subject to Section 3 hereof, in every such Event of Default and at
any  time  thereafter during the continuance of such Event of Default, this
Note shall,  at  the option of Payee, immediately become due and payable,
both as to principal,  interest and any other amounts due hereunder without
presentment, demand  or  protest, all of which are hereby expressly waived,
anything contained herein  or  other evidence of such indebtedness to the
contrary notwithstanding. Subject  to  Section 3 hereof, in case any one or
more Events of Default shall occur  and be  continuing, Payee may proceed to
protect and enforce its rights by an action  at  law, suit in equity or
other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific  performance of any
agreement contained in this Note or for an injunction  against  a violation
of any of the terms hereof or thereof or in and of the exercise  of  any
power granted hereby or thereby or by law. No right conferred upon  Payee 
shall be exclusive of any other right referred to herein or now or hereafter 
available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. In the event that 
Payee  shall exercise or endeavor to exercise any remedies hereunder, Maker
shall  pay  on demand all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith  or  in connection with any reorganization, bankruptcy,
insolvency, readjustment  of  debt, dissolution or liquidation of Maker,
including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,
and Payee may take judgment for  all such amounts in addition to all other
sums due hereunder.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) Pursuant  to the provisions of Article 10 of the Agreement, Payee has
agreed to indemnify  Maker and its Affiliates (as defined in the Agreement)
for certain Losses  (as  defined in the Agreement). Maker shall have the
right (without prior notice  and  when permitted by law) to set-off or
recoup all amounts due from Payee  to Maker  as indemnification for Losses
by a dollar for dollar reduction in the principal  amount of this Note and
any interest hereunder subject to and in accordance  with  the provisions of
Section 10.6 of the Agreement. For clarity, if Maker  determines to make a
claim for indemnification pursuant to Article 10 of  the  Agreement and
elects to set off obligations owed under this Note in accordance  with
Article 10, Maker shall delay making any payment otherwise owed hereunder; 
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if  Maker's good faith estimate of the
maximum Losses (the " _Estimated  Amount_ ")  is  less than the outstanding
principal amount of this Note, then, for purposes  of  determining any
payment owed under this Note prior to such time as the  claim is  resolved,
( _i_ )  the  outstanding principal balance of this Note shall be reduced by
the Estimated  Amount and ( _ii_ )  interest payments shall be computed
based on the outstanding principal  balance  reduced as provided in clause
(i). When a final determination is made as  to the  indemnity claim, ( _A_
)  the  outstanding principal balance will be appropriately reduced (to the
extent  the  claim is successful), ( _B_ )  any  interest in respect of
outstanding principal shall be recomputed and, to  the  extent owed, paid
based on the principal as adjusted and ( _C_ )  to the  extent that, after
giving effect to any set off or reduction of this Note  provided for herein,
Maker shall be obligated to make any payment hereunder  that  would
otherwise have been due on an earlier date, Maker shall make such  payment 
within 10 days after the date on which the amount of the reduction is
finally  determined; _provided_   that in  no event shall Maker be required
to pay any default interest, late fee  or charge  or the like or be
considered in default so long as such payment is made  in such  10-day
period. For purposes of calculating Payee's indemnification obligations  (and
any applicable caps and limitations set forth in the Agreement), only  the 
amount of principal that is set off or reduced hereunder shall be included 
(that  is, foregone interest shall not be considered payments made).

 



 

(b) The  failure of Payee to exercise any of its rights hereunder or the
waiver  of such  rights in any particular instance shall not be deemed a
waiver of Payee's right  to accelerate upon a future default by Maker. No
delay in the exercise  thereof  shall be deemed a waiver of such option, nor
shall any notice of intention  to  exercise such option be necessary.

 



 

(c) Except  as  otherwise provided herein, Maker and all sureties, endorsers
and guarantors  of  this Note waive demand, presentment for payment, notice
of nonpayment,  protest,  notice of protest, and all other notice, filing of
suit and diligence in  collecting this Note or enforcing any of the security
henceforth, and agree  to  any substitution, exchange or release of any of
such security or the release  of  any property primarily or secondarily
liable hereon and further agree that  it  will not be necessary for any
holder hereof, in order to enforce payment  by them  of this Note to first
institute suit or exhaust their remedies against  any Maker  or others
liable hereafter, or to enforce their rights against any security  hereafter
and consent to any extension or postponement of time of payment  of  this
Note or any other indulgence with respect hereto, without notice thereof 
to  any of them.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) This  Note  will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the
laws of the State  of  Delaware.

 



 

(e) Maker  agrees to pay on demand all reasonable expenses or other costs,
including  reasonable attorneys' fees and expert witness fees, incurred by
Payee in  connection with the enforcement or collection against Maker of any
provision  of  this Note, including in any state or federal bankruptcy or
reorganization  proceeding.

_Payee_ ")  or  registered assigns at c/o Cavan Management Services, LLC,
15333 North Pima  Road,  Suite 305, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260, or such
address as Payee shall provide  Maker, the principal sum of Forty-Five
Million and No/100 Dollars ($45,000,000),  with interest as provided in this
Note. This Note is executed by Maker  and  delivered to Payee in accordance
with the terms of a Securities Purchase  Agreement by and among Maker, Payee,
Sedona Development Partners, LLC,  David V.  Cavan and Cavan Management
Services, L.L.C. dated November 3, 2006 (the  " _Agreement_ ").

 



 

1. _Principal  and Interest; Maturity_.  This  Note shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof at the rate  of  eight percent (8%) per annum; _provided_   that,  following an Event of Default (as defined below), this Note shall bear  interest  at the default rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum. Interest on the  Note  shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as applicable,  and the  actual number of days elapsed, and all accrued but unpaid interest shall  be  payable in cash on [___________], 2008 and semi-annually thereafter on  each  [______] and [______]. Subject to prior conversion or prepayment, in each  case  in accordance with the terms hereof, and subject to the terms and provisions  of  the Escrow Agreement (as defined in the Agreement) and Section 6(a) hereof  and  the subordination provisions herein, Maker shall pay the principal balance  of  this Note, without set-off, deduction or counterclaim, together in each  case  with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on [________] [__], 2011.  All  payments of principal and interest on this Note shall be made by Maker  in lawful  money of the United States of America in immediately available funds not  later  than 11:00 a.m., Phoenix, Arizona time, on the date such payment is due  or, if  such date is not a business day, then on the next succeeding business day,  by  wire transfer to the bank account designated by Payee in writing to Maker  at  least three business days prior to such payment date.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. _Prepayment_.  Maker  shall have the right and privilege of prepaying all or any part of the  principal  of this Note at any time without notice, premium or penalty. All payments  on  this Note shall be applied first, to any outstanding charges hereunder,  and then  to accrued interest, and then to principal.

 



 

3. _Conversion_.  All of  outstanding principal amount of this Note shall be converted into shares  of the  common stock of Maker (the " _Common  Stock_ "),  on  the basis of one share of such stock for each $6.4285714 (the " _Conversion  Price_ ")  in  principal amount of this Note ( _i_ )  at  Payee's option at any time during the 30-day period commencing on the first  anniversary of the Closing Date (as defined in the Agreement), but not  thereafter, or ( _ii_ )  automatically if at any time after the first anniversary of the Closing  Date (as  defined in the Agreement) the average daily closing price of a share of  the  Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange (or such other securities exchange  as the Common Stock may from time to time be listed) during the preceding  20  trading days equals or exceeds the Conversion Price. Maker shall have no  obligation to pay any interest on this Note accrued but unpaid at the time  of  conversion, and the requirement to pay such interest shall be deemed waived.  Conversion pursuant to clause (i) above shall be effected by the surrender  of  this Note at the principal office of Maker (or such other office or agency  of  Maker in the continental United States as Maker may designate by notice  in  writing to Payee) at any time during such 30-day period during usual business  hours, together with notice in writing that Payee wishes to convert all  of the  principal amount outstanding of this Note, which notice shall also include  instructions for delivery of the Common Stock to Payee. Conversion pursuant  to  clause (i) above shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close  of  business on the date on which this Note shall have been surrendered and  such  notice shall have been received, and conversion pursuant to clause (ii)  above  shall be deemed to have occurred upon the close of business on the last  day in  the 20-day trading period described in such clause (ii) above, and at such  time  (in either case, the " _Conversion  Date_ ")  the  rights of Payee with respect to the principal amount of this Note converted  shall cease and Payee shall be deemed to have become the holder of record  of the  shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion. As promptly as reasonably  practicable after the Conversion Date, Maker shall deliver, or cause to  be  delivered, to Payee certificates representing the number of shares of Common  Stock issuable by reason of such conversion registered in the name of Payee;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  in the  case of conversion pursuant to clause (ii) above, Maker shall not be obligated  to deliver such certificates until Payee has surrendered this Note at the  principal office of Maker (or such other office or agency of Maker in the  continental United States as Maker may designate by notice in writing to  Payee).  The Conversion Price will be appropriately and equitably adjusted for any  stock  split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification or similar event with  respect to the Common Stock.

4. _Subordination_.  Payee  understands and agrees that all amounts payable under this Note, whether  for  principal, interest or expenses, and the enforcement of Payee\'s rights  in  respect thereof, shall be subordinate and junior to all Senior Indebtedness  (as  defined below). If any default occurs in the payment of the principal of  or  premium or interest on any Senior Indebtedness (whether as a result of  the  acceleration thereof by the holder of any Senior Indebtedness or otherwise)  (a " _Payment  Default_ "),  then  during the continuance of such default and until such payment has been  made or  such default has been cured or waived in writing by the holder of the Senior  Indebtedness, no payment of principal or interest or other amount on this  Note  shall be made by Maker or accepted by Payee and Payee shall not demand  or  exercise remedies to enforce or collect such amounts (but may accelerate  this  Note as provided in clauses (b) through (d) of Section 5 of this Note).  In  addition, no payment of principal or interest or other amount on this Note  shall  be made by Maker or accepted by Payee and Payee shall not demand or exercise  remedies to enforce or collect such amount if the following three conditions  shall exist: ( _i_ )  any  default other than a Payment Default occurs on any Senior Indebtedness,  ( _ii_ )  Payee  has received written notice (" _Default  Notice_ ")  of  such default from Maker or the holder of such Senior Indebtedness and  ( _iii_ )  such  default shall not have been cured by Maker or waived in writing by the  holder of  the Senior Indebtedness and less than 180 days shall have elapsed after  the date  of receipt by Payee of the Default Notice; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  nothing in this sentence shall affect the ability of Payee to accelerate  this  Note as provided in clauses (b) through (d) of Section 5 of this Note).  The term " _Senior  Indebtedness_ " shall  mean money borrowed (including without limitation all principal, interest  (whether or not allowed in a proceeding), fees and all other amounts owing  in  connection therewith) from, or otherwise represented by notes payable to,  a bank  or other financial institution or institution in the business of lending  money  which is secured in whole or in part by any assets or property of Maker  and/or  any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. Any payments received by Payee  in  violation of the foregoing provisions shall be deemed to be held in trust  by  Payee for the benefit of the applicable payee of the Senior Indebtedness.  Payee  agrees, at the request of any payee of Senior Indebtedness, to execute  such  additional documents and instruments which any payee of Senior Indebtedness  may  reasonably request to carry out the foregoing and other customary subordination  provisions. Except as set forth in the Escrow Agreement (as defined in  the  Agreement) and Section 6(a) hereof, nothing contained in this Section 4  or  elsewhere in this Note is intended to or shall impair as between Maker,  its  creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and Payee, the  obligation of Maker, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to Payee  the  principal of and interest on this Note as and when the same shall become  due and  payable in accordance with its terms, or is intended to or shall affect  the  relative rights of Payee and the creditors of Maker other than the holders  of  Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein prevent Payee from exercising  all  remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon the occurrence of an  Event  of Default under this Note, subject to the rights, if any, under this Section  4  of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash or other property  of  Maker received upon the exercise of any such remedy. Payee shall not be  deemed  to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness. In the  event  that Maker fails to make a payment on account of principal of or interest  on or  other amounts due in respect of this Note by reason of any provision of  this  Section 4, such failure shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder,  and the  fact that such failure resulted from the application of this Section 4  shall not  be construed as preventing the occurrence of, or mitigating, such Event  of  Default.

 

 

5. _Events  of Default_.  In each  case of the happening of any of the following events (each of which is  herein  sometimes called an " _Event  of Default_ "):

 



 

(a) default  in the payment of any amount due under this Note for more than
seven (7)  days  after the date when the same shall become due and payable;

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) acceleration  of the payment of any principal, interest or applicable
premium, if any,  due,  prior to the stated maturity or payment date
thereof, pursuant to any bond,  debenture, note or other evidence of
indebtedness or under one or more  mortgages, indentures or instruments under
which there may be issued, or  by  which there may be secured or evidenced,
any indebtedness of Maker or any  subsidiary of Maker, whether such
indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter  be  created, in an aggregate
amount which exceeds $5,000,000;

 



 

(c) Maker  ( _i_ )  is  unable or admits in writing its inability to pay
its monetary obligations  as  they become due, ( _ii_ )  makes a  general
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or ( _iii_ )  applies  for,
consents to, or acquiesces in, the appointment of a trustee, receiver,  or 
other custodian for itself or its property or any part thereof, or in the 
absence of such application, consent, or acquiescence a trustee, receiver, 
or  other custodian is appointed for Maker or its property or any part
thereof,  and  such appointment is not discharged within ninety days; or

 



 

(d) Commencement  of any case under the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the
United State Code,  or  commencement of any other bankruptcy arrangement,
reorganization, receivership,  custodianship, or similar proceeding under any
federal, state, or foreign  law by  or against Maker and with respect to any
such case or proceeding that is  involuntary, such case or proceeding is not
dismissed within ninety days  of the  filing thereof;

 



 

then,  subject to Section 4 hereof, in every such Event of Default and at
any  time  thereafter during the continuance of such Event of Default, this
Note shall,  at  the option of Payee, immediately become due and payable,
both as to principal,  interest and any other amounts due hereunder without
presentment, demand  or  protest, all of which are hereby expressly waived,
anything contained herein  or  other evidence of such indebtedness to the
contrary notwithstanding. Subject  to  Section 4 hereof, in case any one or
more Events of Default shall occur  and be  continuing, Payee may proceed to
protect and enforce its rights by an action  at  law, suit in equity or
other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific  performance of any
agreement contained in this Note or for an injunction  against  a violation
of any of the terms hereof or thereof or in and of the exercise  of  any
power granted hereby or thereby or by law. No right conferred upon  Payee 
shall be exclusive of any other right referred to herein or now or hereafter 
available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. In the event that 
Payee  shall exercise or endeavor to exercise any remedies hereunder, Maker
shall  pay  on demand all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith  or  in connection with any reorganization, bankruptcy,
insolvency, readjustment  of  debt, dissolution or liquidation of Maker,
including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,
and Payee may take judgment for  all such amounts in addition to all other
sums due hereunder.

6. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) Pursuant  to the provisions of Article 10 of the Agreement, Payee has
agreed to indemnify  Maker and its Affiliates (as defined in the Agreement)
for certain Losses  (as  defined in the Agreement). Maker shall have the
right (without prior notice  and  when permitted by law) to set-off or
recoup all amounts due from Payee  to Maker  as indemnification for Losses
by a dollar for dollar reduction in the principal  amount of this Note and
any interest hereunder subject to and in accordance  with  the provisions of
Section 10.6 of the Agreement. For clarity, it is agreed  that  no payment
of interest shall be made on this Note so long as this Note  shall be  held
in the Escrow Fund. If Maker, at a time when this Note is not held  in the 
Escrow Fund, determines to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to 
Article  10 of the Agreement and elects to set off obligations owed under
this Note  in  accordance with Article 10, Maker shall delay making any
payment otherwise  owed  hereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if 
Maker's good faith estimate of the maximum Losses (the " _Estimated  Amount_
")  is  less than the outstanding principal amount of this Note, then, for
purposes  of  determining any payment owed under this Note prior to such
time as the  claim is  resolved, ( _i_ )  the  outstanding principal
balance of this Note shall be reduced by the Estimated  Amount and ( _ii_ ) 
interest payments shall be computed based on the outstanding principal 
balance  reduced as provided in clause (i). When a final determination is
made as  to the  indemnity claim, ( _A_ )  the  outstanding principal
balance will be appropriately reduced (to the extent  the  claim is
successful), ( _B_ )  any  interest in respect of outstanding principal
shall be recomputed and, to  the  extent owed, paid based on the principal
as adjusted and ( _C_ )  to the  extent that, after giving effect to any set
off or reduction of this Note  provided for herein, Maker shall be obligated
to make any payment hereunder  that  would otherwise have been due on an
earlier date, Maker shall make such  payment  within 10 days after the date
on which the amount of the reduction is finally  determined; _provided_  
that in  no event shall Maker be required to pay any default interest, late
fee  or charge  or the like or be considered in default so long as such
payment is made  in such  10-day period. For purposes of calculating Payee's
indemnification obligations  (and any applicable caps and limitations set
forth in the Agreement), only  the  amount of principal that is set off or
reduced hereunder shall be included  (that  is, foregone interest shall not
be considered payments made). In addition,  if  this Note is converted into
Common Stock when not held in the Escrow Fund  and  Maker has made a claim
for indemnification pursuant to Article 10 and sought  to  set off against
this Note, Maker shall deliver to Payee a stock certificate  representing the
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the shares of  Common  Stock to be
issued pursuant to Section 3 hereof less a number of shares  of  Common
Stock equal to the Estimated Amount divided by the Conversion Price; 
_provided_   that if,  when a final determination is made as to the
indemnity claim, the actual  Losses  are less than the Estimated Amount,
Maker shall deliver to Payee a stock  certificate representing the number of
shares of Common Stock equal to  ( _y_ )  the  difference between the
actual Losses and the Estimated Amount divided by  ( _z_ )  the  Conversion
Price; and the remainder of such shares shall be deemed forfeited  by  Payee
and cancelled.

 



 

(b) The  failure of Payee to exercise any of its rights hereunder or the
waiver  of such  rights in any particular instance shall not be deemed a
waiver of Payee's right  to accelerate upon a future default by Maker. No
delay in the exercise  thereof  shall be deemed a waiver of such option, nor
shall any notice of intention  to  exercise such option be necessary.

 



 

(c) Except  as  otherwise provided herein, Maker and all sureties, endorsers
and guarantors  of  this Note waive demand, presentment for payment, notice
of nonpayment,  protest,  notice of protest, and all other notice, filing of
suit and diligence in  collecting this Note or enforcing any of the security
henceforth, and agree  to  any substitution, exchange or release of any of
such security or the release  of  any property primarily or secondarily
liable hereon and further agree that  it  will not be necessary for any
holder hereof, in order to enforce payment  by them  of this Note to first
institute suit or exhaust their remedies against  any Maker  or others
liable hereafter, or to enforce their rights against any security  hereafter
and consent to any extension or postponement of time of payment  of  this
Note or any other indulgence with respect hereto, without notice thereof 
to  any of them.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) This  Note  will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the
laws of the State  of  Delaware.

 



 

(e) Maker  agrees to pay on demand all reasonable expenses or other costs,
including  reasonable attorneys' fees and expert witness fees, incurred by
Payee in  connection with the enforcement or collection against Maker of any
provision  of  this Note, including in any state or federal bankruptcy or
reorganization  proceeding.

**ESCROW  AGREEMENT**

 

 

This  Escrow Agreement is entered into as of [__________] [__], 2007 (the  "
_Escrow  Agreement_ "),  by  and among Seven Canyons Investors, LLC, an
Arizona limited liability  company  (the " _Seller_ "),  Cold  Spring
Capital Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Purchaser_ "),  and  Mellon
Trust of New England, N.A., a national banking association,  as escrow 
agent (the " _Escrow  Agent_ ").  The  Seller and the Purchaser are
referred to herein collectively as the  " _Escrow  Parties_."

 

 

**Introduction**

 



 

The  Purchaser, Sedona Development Partners, LLC, an Arizona limited
liability  company (the " _Company_ "),  the  Seller, David V. Cavan and
Cavan Management Services, L.L.C. have entered  into a  Securities Purchase
Agreement dated as of November 3, 2006 (the " _Purchase  Agreement_ "), 
pursuant to which the Purchaser will purchase the Securities from the 
Seller.  Pursuant to Section 1.5 of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser
shall  deliver  the Escrow Amount (as hereinafter defined) to the Escrow
Agent as security  for  the indemnification obligations of the Seller under
Article 10 of the  Purchase  Agreement. The Seller and the Purchaser desire
to appoint the Escrow  Agent as  the escrow agent for the Escrow Amount, and
the parties hereto wish  to specify  their respective rights and obligations
with respect to the Escrow  Account (as  defined below) established under
this Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Capitalized  terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings  ascribed to  them in the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

NOW,  THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency  of  which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

 



 

**1.** **Appointment  of Escrow Agent.**   Mellon  Trust of New England,
N.A. is hereby appointed as Escrow Agent under  this Escrow  Agreement and
the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment.

 

 

**2.** **Deposit  of Escrow Amount.**   On the  date hereof, the Purchaser
shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow  Agent  in accordance with
Section 1.5 of the Purchase Agreement and the terms  and  conditions hereof.
The Escrow Amount shall be held hereunder by the  Escrow Agent  (the "
_Escrow  Account_ ")  as  security for the indemnification obligations of
the Seller under Article  10 of  the Purchase Agreement, as more
specifically set forth therein. As  used herein,  the term " _Escrow 
Amount_ " means  the $1,000,000 of cash (the " _Escrow  Cash_ ")  and 
$7,500,000 in principal amount of Convertible Notes (the " _Escrow  Note_
")  initially placed in the Escrow Account hereunder, together with all 
interest,  dividends and other income earned and accrued with respect
thereto,  and any  shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Escrow Note (" _Escrow  Shares_ "),  less  amounts distributed from the
Escrow Account from time to time in accordance  herewith. The Escrow Note and
the stock certificate representing any  Escrow  Shares will registered in
the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for  the  Seller. In the event that
some or all of the Escrow Note or any Escrow  Shares  are to be released to
the Seller pursuant hereto, the Purchaser shall  cause such  Escrow Note or
the Escrow Shares, as the case may be, to be registered  in the  name of the
Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Escrow Agent shall deposit any cash included in the Escrow Account  in
one or  more interest-bearing deposit accounts at Mellon Trust of New
England,  N.A. in  accordance with such written instructions and directions
as may from  time to  time be provided to the Escrow Agent by the Purchaser
until the such  cash is  released pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Escrow Agreement;  _provided_   that,  notwithstanding any such
written instructions or directions, the Escrow  Agent  shall not deposit any
such cash in any accounts or instruments that  have a  maturity of more than
30 days.  In the  event that the Escrow Agent does not receive such written
instructions,  the  Escrow Agent shall deposit any cash included in the
Escrow Account  in money  market accounts at Mellon Trust of New England,
N.A., in each case  having  maturity dates that permit payments to be made
from the Escrow Amount  in  accordance with the terms hereof. Deposits shall
in all instances be  subject to  the Escrow Agent's standard funds
availability policy. The Escrow Agent shall  not be responsible for any loss
due to interest rate fluctuation or  early  withdrawal penalty. The
Purchaser and the Seller understand that deposits  of the  cash are not
necessarily insured by the United States Government or  any agency  or
instrumentality thereof, or of any state or municipality, and that  such 
deposits do not necessarily earn a fixed rate of return. In no instance 
shall  the Escrow Agent have any obligation to provide investment advice of 
any kind.  The Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss
resulting  from  any deposits made pursuant to this Section 2,  other 
than as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct  of
the  Escrow Agent.

 

 

**3.** **Disposition  of Escrow Amount.**

 

 

**(a)** If,  at  any time on or prior to one year following the date of this
Escrow  Agreement  (the " _Escrow  Termination Date_ "),  the  Purchaser
believes that it is entitled to indemnification from the  Seller  pursuant
to Article 10 of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser shall  deliver to 
the Escrow Agent and the Seller, prior to the Escrow Termination Date,  a
written  notice (a " _Claim  Notice_ ")  specifying in reasonable detail
the facts constituting the basis for  such  indemnification claim (a "
_Claim_ ")  and  the amount sought therefor, or an estimate thereof, by the
Purchaser  from the  Escrow Amount (a " _Claimed  Amount_ ").  From  the
date that a Claim Notice is received by the Escrow Agent (notice  of such 
date shall be given by the Escrow Agent to the Seller), the Seller  shall
have 15  days (the " _Notice  Period_ ")  to  deliver to the Escrow Agent,
with copies to the Purchaser, contrary  instructions  disputing the Claim
Notice and specifying in reasonable detail why  the Purchaser  is not
entitled to the Claimed Amount (a " _Dispute  Notice_ ").  If  the Escrow
Agent does not receive a Dispute Notice prior to 5:00 p.m.  (Eastern  Time)
of the last day of the Notice Period, the Escrow Agent shall  promptly 
release the Claimed Amount to the Purchaser according to the disbursement 
instructions in the Claim Notice. If the Escrow Agent receives a Dispute 
Notice  prior to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) of the last day of the Notice
Period, the  Escrow Agent shall make payment to the Purchaser only with
respect  to the amount  not disputed by the Dispute Notice and shall
continue to hold in the  Escrow  Account the disputed portion of Claimed
Amount described in the Dispute  Notice  until ( _x_ )  it  shall receive
Joint Written Instructions (as defined below) as to the  disposition of such
sum or ( _y_ )  it  shall be otherwise ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction (a " _Court  Order_ ").  Amounts to be released to the
Purchaser under this Section 3(a) shall  be  released first from the cash in
the Escrow Account and then, to the  extent there  remains no cash in the
Escrow Account, from the Escrow Note or the  Escrow  Shares. If less than
all of the Escrow Note is to be released hereunder,  then  the Purchaser
shall, as a condition to such release, deliver to the  Escrow Agent  a new
Escrow Note in the principal amount that is to remain in the  Escrow 
Account after such partial release. If less than all of the Escrow  Shares
are to  be released hereunder, then the Purchaser shall, as a condition to 
such release,  deliver or cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent a new
stock certificate  representing the Escrow Shares that are to remain in the
Escrow Account  after  such partial release.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(b)** If  the  Purchaser believes that a Claim constitutes, or may upon
final resolution  constitute, a basis for a Claimed Amount hereunder, then
the Purchaser  may  submit a Claim Notice even though such Claim may be
uncertain or unresolved  or  the exact amount of any Claimed Amount may be
unknown at the time of  such Claim  Notice. The Purchaser may estimate the
maximum amount of exposure with  respect  to any Claim and such estimated
amount shall constitute a Claimed Amount  for  purposes of this Section 3.

 

 

**(c)** Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Escrow Agreement,
if the Escrow Agent  receives  written instructions from both of the Escrow
Parties, or their respective  successors or assigns, substantially in the
form of **_Exhibit  A_** ,  as to  the disbursement of some or all of the
Escrow Amount (the " _Joint  Written Instructions_ "),  the  Escrow Agent
shall disburse the Escrow Amount pursuant to such Joint  Written 
Instructions.

 

 

**(d)** Promptly  following the Escrow Termination Date, but in any event not
later than  three  business days after the Escrow Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent shall  release  to the Seller an amount equal to the Escrow
Amount as of the Escrow  Termination  Date less any Claimed Amounts required
to be retained as of the Escrow  Termination Date pursuant to Section 3(a)
above. Any portion of the  Escrow  Amount that is held by the Escrow Agent
beyond the Escrow Termination  Date  pursuant to the prior sentence shall be
released by the Escrow Agent  to the  Seller or to the Purchaser, as the
case may be, at such time as a Joint  Written  Instruction or a Court Order
is delivered to the Escrow Agent.

 

 

**(e)** This  Escrow Agreement and all of the obligations of the Escrow Agent
hereunder  shall  terminate upon the release of the entirety of the Escrow
Amount by  the Escrow  Agent pursuant to this Section 3.

 

 

**(f)** For  purposes of compensating the Purchaser for its Losses (as
defined in  the  Purchase Agreement) pursuant to this Agreement, each Escrow
Share,  if any, shall  be valued at $6.4285714 (the " _Purchaser  Stock
Price_ "),  and  the Escrow Note and the Escrow Cash shall be valued at
their respective  face  values. If some or all of the value to be
distributed to the Purchaser  (or to  the Seller upon termination of the
escrow) consists of Escrow Shares  but such  value is not evenly divisible
by the Purchaser Stock Price, the number  of Escrow  Shares to be
distributed will be rounded down to the next highest number  of  shares. In
lieu of the fractional interest not distributed, the Purchaser  shall 
furnish to the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent in turn will distribute  to
the  Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable, cash equal to such fractional 
interest  times the Purchaser Stock Price. The Escrow Agent shall have no
duty  or  obligation with respect to the preceding sentence unless and
until  it has  received sufficient cash from the Purchaser with respect to
its duties  and  obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence. The
Purchaser shall  be deemed to  have purchased the fractional interest with
respect to which it has  furnished  funds to the Escrow Agent. In all
events, the Purchaser shall so purchase  only a  whole number of shares. The
Purchaser Stock Price shall be appropriately,  equitably adjusted for any
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations  or the  like, and any
securities received by the Escrow Agent upon a stock  split, stock 
dividend, combination or the like shall be added to the Escrow Account  and 
become a part thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**4.** **Payments  from Escrow Amount.**   All  payments of cash from the
Escrow Account shall be made by wire transfer  of  immediately available
funds to the party receiving the  distribution.

 

 

Any  wire  transfers shall be made subject to, and in accordance with, the
Escrow  Agent's  normal electronic funds transfer procedures  in  effect
from time to time. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely  upon all 
bank and account information provided to the Escrow Agent by any of  the
Escrow  Parties. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to verify or otherwise 
confirm any  written wire transfer instructions but it may do so in its
discretion  on any  occasion without incurring any liability to any of the
Escrow Parties  for  failing to do so on any other occasion. The Escrow
Agent shall process  all wire  transfers based on bank identification and
account numbers rather than  the names  of the intended recipient of the
funds, even if such numbers pertain  to a  recipient other than the
recipient identified in the payment instructions.  The  Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to detect any such inconsistencies  and shall  resolve any such
inconsistencies by using the account number.

 

 

**5.** **Rights,  Responsibilities and Liability of Escrow Agent.**

 

 

**(a)** This  Escrow Agreement sets forth, exclusively, the duties of the
Escrow  Agent and no  additional duties or obligations shall be inferred
herefrom or implied  hereby.  The Escrow Agent's duties shall be determined
only with reference to this Escrow  Agreement and applicable laws. The Escrow
Agent is not charged with  knowledge of  or any duties or responsibilities
under any agreement or understanding  to which  the agency created hereby
relates, including, without limitation, the  Purchase  Agreement.

 

 

**(b)** Except  in  cases of the Escrow Agent's bad faith, willful
misconduct or gross negligence,  the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected (
_i_ )  in  acting in reliance upon any certificate, statement, request,
notice,  advice,  instruction, direction, other agreement or instrument or
signature  reasonably  and in good faith believed by the Escrow Agent to be
genuine, or ( _ii_ )  in  assuming that any person purporting to give the
Escrow Agent any of  the  foregoing in accordance with the provisions
hereof, or in connection  with either  this Escrow Agreement or the Escrow
Agent's duties hereunder, has been duly  authorized to do so. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any mistake  of  fact or law or any error of
judgment, or for any act or omission, except  as a  result of its bad 
faith, **** willful  misconduct or gross negligence. The Escrow Agent shall
not be responsible  for  any loss incurred upon any investment made under
circumstances not  constituting **** bad  faith,  willful  misconduct or
gross negligence.

 

 

In  connection with any payments that the Escrow Agent is instructed to 
make by wire  transfer, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions  of  ( _i_ )  any  Escrow Party or other person providing such
instructions, including  without  limitation errors as to the amount, bank
information or bank account  number; or  ( _ii_ )  any  other person or
entity, including without limitation any Federal Reserve  Bank,  any
transmission or communications facility, any funds transfer system,  any 
receiver or receiving depository financial institution, and no such  person
or  entity shall be deemed to be an agent of the Escrow Agent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

77  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is hereby agreed that 
in no event  will the Escrow Agent be liable for any lost profits or other
indirect,  special,  incidental or consequential damages which the parties
may incur or  experience by  reason of having entered into or relied on this
Escrow Agreement or  arising out  of or in connection with the Escrow
Agent's services, even if the Escrow Agent  was advised or otherwise made
aware of the possibility of such damages.  In no  event shall the Escrow
Agent be liable for acts of God, breakdowns  or  malfunctions of machines or
computers, interruptions or malfunctions  of  communications or power
supplies, labor difficulties, actions of public  authorities, acts of war, or
any other similar cause or catastrophe  beyond the  Escrow Agent's
reasonable control.

 

 

**(c)** The  Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice from, legal
counsel  in the  event of any dispute or question as to the construction of
any of the  provisions  hereof or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur
no liability and  shall be  fully protected in acting in good faith in
accordance with the advice  of such  counsel.

 

 

**(d)** The  Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification of this
Escrow  Agreement  unless it shall have specifically consented thereto in
writing.

 

 

**(e)** Except  as  provided in Section 5(i)  hereof,  the  Escrow Agent
shall hold the Escrow Amount and provide the other services  described in
this Escrow Agreement free of charge. Except as provided  in Section  5(i)
hereof, neither the Seller nor the Company shall have any obligation 
whatsoever to reimburse the Escrow Agent, from the Escrow Amount or 
otherwise,  for any costs, fees or expenses including, without limitation,
fees  and expenses  of counsel, which the Escrow Agent may incur in
connection with the  discharge of  its duties hereunder or the exercise of
or enforcement by the parties  of their  respective rights hereunder.

 

 

**(f)** The  Escrow Agent may resign by giving notice in writing to the
Escrow Parties  of  such resignation, specifying a date when such
resignation shall take  effect  (which shall in no event be earlier than
**** 15  business  days after the giving of such notice). Thereafter, the
Escrow Agent  shall have  no further obligation hereunder except to hold the
Escrow Amount and  the  interest thereon as depository. Promptly upon
receipt of such notice,  the Escrow  Parties shall agree in writing upon a
successor escrow agent who shall  be  mutually acceptable to them;
_provided_   that, if  the Escrow Parties are unable to agree upon a
successor escrow agent  within ten  business days of receipt of such notice,
the Seller and/or the Purchaser  may  petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of  such  successor escrow agent or other
appropriate relief and any such resulting  appointment shall be binding upon
the parties hereto. Any such successor  escrow  agent shall deliver to the
Escrow Parties and to the Escrow Agent a  written  instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon it shall  succeed  to all the rights
and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder, and shall  be  entitled to receive
the Escrow Amount and the interest thereon to hold  in escrow  pursuant to
the terms and conditions hereof. The Escrow Agent shall  deliver all  of the
Escrow Amount and the interest thereon to the successor escrow  agent 
approved hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

78  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Escrow Parties acting together shall have the right to terminate the 
appointment  of the Escrow Agent, specifying the date upon which such
termination  shall take  effect. Thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall have no
further obligation  to the  Escrow Parties except to hold the Escrow Account
as depository and  not  otherwise. The Escrow Parties agree that they will
jointly appoint  a banking  corporation, trust company or attorney as
successor escrow agent. The  Escrow  Agent shall refrain from taking any
action until it shall receive joint  written  instructions from all of the
Escrow Parties designating the successor  escrow  agent. The Escrow Agent
shall deliver all of the Escrow Account to  such  successor escrow agent in
accordance with such instructions and upon  receipt of  the Escrow Account,
the successor escrow agent shall be bound by all  of the  provisions of this
Escrow Agreement.

 

 

**(g)** In  the  event of any dispute between the Seller and the Purchaser,
or between  the Escrow  Agent and any one or more of the other parties
hereto, with regard  to the Escrow  Agent or its duties, or any other matter
concerning the disposition  of the  Escrow Amount, or in the event that the
Escrow Agent, in good faith,  is in doubt  as to what action it should take
hereunder, it may, without liability  to any  person, refrain from taking
any action other than to keep safely the  Escrow  Amount and the interest
thereon until the Escrow Agent shall receive  a joint  written instruction
from the Escrow Parties.

 

 

**(h)** The  Escrow Parties authorize the Escrow Agent, if the Escrow Agent
is threatened  with litigation or is sued in connection with this Escrow
Agreement,  or, at the  Escrow Agent's option, in the event of a dispute or
any good faith uncertainty  in connection with this Escrow Agreement, to
interplead all interested  parties  in any court of competent jurisdiction
and to deposit the Escrow Amount  with the  clerk of that court. In the
event of any dispute hereunder, the Escrow  Agent  shall be entitled to
petition a court of competent jurisdiction and  shall  perform any acts
ordered by such court.

 

 

**(i)** The  Seller and the Purchaser, hereby jointly and severally agree to
indemnify  the  Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any and
all claims,  suits,  actions, proceedings, investigations, judgments,
deficiencies, damages,  settlements, liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees  and  expenses of an attorney chosen by the Escrow
Agent) as and when incurred,  arising out of or based upon any act, omission,
alleged act or alleged  omission  by the Escrow Agent or any other cause in
any case in connection with  the  acceptance of, or performance or non-
performance by the Escrow Agent  of any of  the Escrow Agent's duties under
this Escrow Agreement, except as a result of the  Escrow Agent's bad faith,
willful misconduct or gross negligence. As among the  Escrow Parties, it is
agreed that any such indemnification obligation  shall be  shared fifty
percent (50%) by the Seller and fifty percent (50%) by  the  Purchaser. In
no event shall any obligation to indemnify the Escrow  Agent under  this
Section 5(i) be satisfied or partially satisfied by the Escrow  Agent 
setting off or claiming against, or retaining or attaching any of,  the
Escrow  Amount or by non-performance by the Escrow Agent of any of its
duties  hereunder;  _provided_   that the  parties agree that the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to withhold any  distribution otherwise required to
be made from the Escrow Account  if any  amounts owed to the Escrow Agent
hereunder remain unpaid on the date  such  distribution would otherwise be
made.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(j)** Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of
Sections 5(b) and  5(i) hereof  shall survive any resignation or removal of
the Escrow Agent, and any  termination of this Escrow Agreement.

 

 

**6.** **Customer  Identification and Tax Withholding and Reporting.** To 
help  the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering 
activities,  federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify and  record  information that identifies each individual or entity
that opens an  account.  Therefore, the Escrow Agent must obtain the name,
address, taxpayer  or other  government identification number, and other
information, such as date  of birth  for individuals, for each individual
and business entity that is a  party to this  Escrow Agreement. For
individuals signing this Escrow Agreement on  their own  behalf or on behalf
of another, the Escrow Agent requires a copy of  a driver's  license,
passport or other form of photo identification. For business  and other 
entities that are parties to this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent  will 
require such documents as it deems necessary to confirm the legal existence 
of  the entity.

 

 

At  the  time of or prior to execution of this Escrow Agreement, any
Escrow  Party  providing a tax identification number for tax reporting
purposes shall  provide  to the Escrow Agent a completed IRS Form W-9 (for
United States Persons)  or IRS  Form W-8 (for non-United States persons), or
any successor forms with  respect to  any interest or gains earned on the

allocation is to be made or the parties will agree  in  writing on such
allocation.

 



 

**15.** **Force  Majeure.** The  obligations of the parties will be subject
to events of force majeure.  If an  event of force majeure causes the
Manager to suspend or interrupt services,  the  Manager and its affiliates
shall allocate the available resources among  all  facilities it owns or
manages on a reasonable basis, without giving  preference  or priority to
any facility over the Residence Club.

 



 

**16.** **Insurance. ** Each  party will maintain the insurance coverage set
forth in the  Agreement.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**17.** **Intellectual  Property; Names.** The  parties will each make
symmetrically reciprocal representations, warranties  and  indemnities to
each other with respect to software or other intellectual  property provided
by such party. Manager shall operate and market the  Residence  Club under
such name or names as the Owner shall specify. The Owner  shall have  sole
title to such names and the Manager shall not claim or purport  to grant
any  right, title or interest in or to such names. Each party will maintain 
the other  party's confidential or proprietary information confidential and
Manager  shall  use confidential or proprietary information of Owner only in
the performance  of  the Agreement.

 



 

**18.** **Title  to Residence Club.** Manager  shall have no lien on or
interest in the Residence Club or its revenue  or  profits or the Accounts,
or any proceeds of insurance or eminent domain  takings,  and shall have
only a contract claim against the Owner for amounts  due Manager  under the
Agreement. In the event Manager becomes aware of any adverse  claim  against
the Residence Club, it shall notify the Owner promptly and  shall  cooperate
with the Owner in defending against such adverse claim. Manager  shall  use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any valid adverse claim  or 
interest from existing or arising with respect to the Residence  Club.

 



 

**19.** **Bank  Accounts**.  All  funds provided by Owner for construction,
capital improvements or working  capital and all revenue of the Residence
Club shall be held, pending  use thereof  by Manager or Owner in accordance
with the Agreement, in interest bearing  accounts, in the name of the Owner,
in such banking institutions as  the Owner  shall approve (the "
**Accounts** ").  All  security and other deposits of the Residence Club
shall be deposited  by Manager  in and held in a separate Account and such
deposits may only be withdrawn  by  Manager if and when permitted or
required under the documents under  which such  deposits were made. All
revenue of the Residence Club shall be deposited  by  Manager in and held in
a separate Account and such funds may only be  withdrawn  by Manager to the
extent permitted by the Agreement. The Manager shall  use the  funds on
deposit in an operating account (the " **Operating  Account** ")  to pay 
the expenses of the Residence Club incurred by the Manager in accordance 
with  the Agreement and to pay the fees due to Manager under the Agreement. 
Prior to  the effective date of the Agreement, the Owner shall make an
initial  deposit  into the Operating Account in an amount reasonably
determined by Owner  to  provide sufficient initial working capital for the
Residence Club.  All funds for  construction and capital expenditures shall
be deposited by Owner in  a separate  Account, and such funds may only be
withdrawn by Manager with the prior  written  consent of Owner to fund
construction and capital expenditures agreed  to in  writing by Owner.
Reasonable house bank cash funds shall be maintained  at the  Residence Club
for various cashiers as appropriate for making change.  All  payments made
by cashiers shall be charged to the applicable line item,  rather  than
miscellaneous expenses.

 



 

**20**. **Licenses**.  To the  extent permitted by the applicable licensing
authorities, all licenses  and  permits shall be in the name of the Owner,
and otherwise in the name  of Manager.  Manager shall, with the cooperation
of Owner, arrange for and cause  to be  maintained in full force and effect
and in good standing all licenses  and  permits required for the ownership
and operation of the Residence  Club.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

91  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**21.** **Termination. ** As  indicated in Section 4 above, the Agreement
will have a term of ten  years,  subject to extension as provided in Section
4 and to earlier termination  as  provided in this Section. Each party shall
have the right to terminate  the  Agreement in the event of (i) a breach by
the other party of a material  obligation under the Agreement and such party
does not cure such breach  within  30 days after notice thereof or, if such
breach is not reasonably susceptible  to  cure within such 30 day period, if
such party shall not have commenced  to cure  such breach within such 30 day
period and, having commenced, shall  thereafter  not complete the curing
within 60 days after notice, provided that  if a party  commits a material
breach of the same or a similar provision of the  Agreement  three or more
times in any 90 day period the other party may terminate  immediately upon
notice; (ii) the operation of the Residence Club is  terminated  or
suspended for any reason beyond the reasonable control of the terminating 
party (including damage, destruction or eminent domain taking or suspension 
or  revocation of licenses) for a period of more than 90 consecutive days; 
(iii)  bankruptcy events of the other party or material default by the
other  party  under a material agreement of the other party or acceleration
of debt  obligations, and (iv) other customary events of termination. In
addition,  the  Owner may terminate the Agreement (x) at its option, upon
payment to  Manager of  an amount equal to the Termination Fee or (y) at its
option, if, on  or before  the third anniversary of the Agreement, Dave
Cavan ceases for any reason  (including death or disability) to be actively
involved in the day-to-day  operations of Manager, upon payment to Manager of
an amount equal to  one-half of  the Termination Fee (i.e., $500,000). For
purposes of the Agreement,  the "Termination Fee" shall mean $1,000,000, if
such termination occurs before the  third anniversary of the Agreement, and
shall decrease by $100,000  on such third  anniversary and by an additional
$100,000 on each anniversary thereafter.  Manager may terminate the Agreement
at any time after the third anniversary  of  the Agreement upon 180 days
prior written notice to Owner given after  such third  anniversary.

 



 

**22.** **Actions  Upon Termination.** Upon  termination, the Manager shall
surrender the Residence Club in good  working  order and condition and shall
assign or arrange for the transfer or  new issue to  Owner or its designee
of all licenses and permits relating to the Residence  Club  not already in
the name of the Owner. Manager shall also turn over  to Owner all  books,
records and accounts relating to the operation of the Residence  Club and 
all of its personnel. Manager's right to withdraw funds from the Accounts
shall  terminate upon termination of the Agreement. For a reasonable period 
of time  following termination, Manager shall, at the request of the Owner, 
assist and  cooperate in the transition of management of the Residence Club
to  such person  as may be designated by Manager. Following termination, the
Owner will  assume  and perform all contractual obligations arising after
termination under  contracts entered into by the Manager on behalf of the
Residence Club  in  accordance with the Agreement.

 



 

**23.** **Damages;  Set Off Rights.** Each  party shall waive all rights to
special, consequential, indirect, incidental  or  punitive damages and shall
be entitled to collect upon a breach or  termination  direct damages only.
Each party shall have set off rights; _provided_   that  such rights shall
be limited in the case of Manager to the management  fee  payable under the
Agreement.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

92  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**24.** **Indemnification. ** To  the  extent not covered by insurance,
each party shall indemnify the other  against  third party claims that are
result from (i) the gross negligence or  willful  misconduct of the
indemnifying party or its affiliates (it being agreed  that  Manager is not
an agent of Owner for purposes of this indemnification  provision), (ii)
obligations which are to be paid or satisfied by the  indemnifying party
under the Agreement, or (iii) in the case of the  Manager as  the
indemnifying party, obligations incurred by the Manager outside  the scope
of  its authority or in violation of the Agreement. The procedures relating 
to  indemnification, including those with respect to the right to defend 
against and  settle such third party claims, shall be substantially similar
to those  in the  securities purchase agreement between Owner, Seven Canyons
Investors,  L.L.C.,  Manager and others.

 



 

**25.** **Jurisdiction  and Governing Law.** The  Agreement shall be
governed by the internal laws of the State of Arizona.  Each  party consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state  courts of  Arizona
for resolution of all disputes arising under the Agreement.

 



 

**26.** **Termination  of Obligation.**   The  Agreement will provide that
the obligations of Sedona Development,  LLC to pay  Manager $4,000 for each
golf membership and fractional interest initially  sold  by it be terminated
and waived.

2. _Request  for Registration_.

 

 

2.1. _Registration  on Form S-3_.  At any  time when the Company is
eligible to file a Registration Statement  on Form S-3,  one or more Holders
of at least 75% of the Registrable Securities may  by written  notice to the
Company, request that the Company effect the registration  on Form  S-3 of a
number of Registrable Shares for which the gross aggregate  offering  price
is reasonably expected to be at least $2,500,000. Promptly after  receipt 
of such notice, the Company will give written notice of such requested 
registration to all other Holders of Registrable Securities. The Company 
will  then as provided in Section 4 use commercially reasonable efforts to 
effect the  registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable
Securities  which the  Company has been requested to register by such
Holders, and all other  Registrable Securities which the Company has been
requested to register  by other  Holders of Registrable Securities by notice
delivered to the Company  within ten  days after the giving of such notice
by the Company.

 

 

2.2. _Postponement_.  The  Company may postpone for a period of up to 90
days the filing of any  registration required to be filed pursuant to this
Section 2 if the  Board of  Directors of the Company in good faith
determines that such postponement  is  necessary in order to avoid premature
disclosure of a financing, acquisition,  recapitalization, reorganization or
other material transaction, the  disclosure  of which would have a
materially detrimental effect on the Company;  _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  the Company may not exercise such right of postponement more than
twice  within  any period of 365 days. If the Company elects to postpone the
filing  of a  registration statement pursuant to this Section 2.2, two-
thirds of  the Holders  of Registrable Securities who requested such
registration statement  may withdraw  such request and upon such withdrawal,
such request shall be deemed  not to have  been made for any purpose of this
Agreement.

 

 

2.3. _Number  of Requests; Form_.  The  Company shall not be required to
effect more than three registrations  pursuant  to Section 2.1. A
registration requested pursuant to Section 2.1 shall  be  effected by the
filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 (or  any other  form which
includes substantially the same information as would be  required to  be
included in a registration statement on such form as currently constituted). 
No registration of Registrable Securities under Section 2.1 shall be  deemed
to  be a registration for any purpose of this Section 2.3 which shall not 
have  become and remained effective in accordance with the provisions of 
this  Agreement.

 

 

2.4. _Payment  of Expenses_.  The  Company hereby agrees to pay all
Registration Expenses in connection  with all  registrations effected
pursuant to Section 2.1; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company shall
not be required to pay for any expenses of such registration  proceeding if
the registration request is withdrawn at any time at  the request  of the
Majority Participating Holders, and all participating Holders  shall bear 
such expenses, unless the Majority Participating Holders agree to treat 
such  withdrawn registration as a registration which was effected pursuant 
to Section  2.1, which agreement shall bind all Holders of Registrable
Securities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Holders have learned of a
material  adverse  change in the condition, business, or prospects of the
Company from  that known  to the Holders at the time the demand for
registration was made or  if there  shall have occurred a material adverse
change in market conditions  from those  existing as such time in the good
faith judgment of the Majority Participating  Holders makes it undesirable to
proceed with the proposed offering,  then the  Holders shall not be required
to pay any of such expenses, and, in  such case,  the withdrawn registration
shall not count as a registration effected  pursuant  to Section 2.1.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

96  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. _Piggyback  Registration_.  If the  Company at any time proposes to register any of its equity securities  under the  Securities Act, for its own account or for the account of any holder  of its  securities other than Registrable Securities, on a form which would  permit  registration of Registrable Securities for sale to the public under  the  Securities Act, the Company will each such time give notice to all  Holders of  Registrable Securities of its intention to do so. Such notice shall  describe  such securities and specify the form, manner and other relevant aspects  of such  proposed registration. Any such Holder may, by written response delivered  to the  Company within ten days after the giving of any such notice by the  Company,  request that all or a specified part of the Registrable Securities  held by such  Holder be included in such registration. The Company thereupon will  use  commercially reasonable efforts as a part of its filing of such form  to cause to  be included in such registration under the Securities Act all Registrable  Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the  Holders of  Registrable Securities, to the extent required to permit the disposition  (in  accordance with the methods to be used by the Company or other holders  of  securities in such registration) of the Registrable Securities to be  so  registered. The Company shall be under no obligation to complete any  offering of  its securities it proposes to make and shall incur no liability to  any Holder  for its failure to do so. No registration of Registrable Securities  effected  under this Section 3 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations to  effect a registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to  Section 2.1.

 

 

3.1. _Excluded  Transactions_.  The  Company shall not be obligated to
effect any registration of Registrable  Securities under this Section 3
incidental to the registration of any  of its  securities in connection with
mergers, acquisitions, exchange offers,  dividend  reinvestment plans or
stock option or other employee benefit plans.

 

 

3.2. _Payment  of Expenses_.  The  Company hereby agrees to pay all
Registration Expenses in connection  with each  registration of Registrable
Securities requested pursuant to this  Section 3.

 

 

4. _Registration  Procedures_.  If and  whenever the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts  to  effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities  Act  as provided in Sections 2 or 3 hereof, the Company, subject to the terms of  Sections 2 and 3, will as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

 

 

4.1. _Registration  Statement_.  Prepare  and (in the case of a
registration pursuant to Section 2 hereof, promptly  and in  any event
within 30 days after a request for registration is delivered  to the 
Company under Section 2.1) file with the Commission a registration 
statement  with respect to such Registrable Securities and use commercially
reasonable  efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective
as  soon as  possible thereafter. Such registration statement shall be for
an offering  to be  made on a continuous or delayed basis (a so-called
"shelf registration  statement") if the Company is eligible for the use
thereof and the Majority  Participating Holders have requested a shelf
registration  statement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

97  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.2. _Amendments  and Supplements to Registration Statement_.  Prepare  and
file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to such 
registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith  as
may be  necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to
comply  with the  provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of  all  Registrable Securities and other securities, if any,
covered by such  registration statement until the later of (i) such time as
all such  Registrable Securities have been disposed of by the seller or
sellers  thereof in  accordance with the intended methods of disposition set
forth in such  registration statement (but in no event for a period of more
than one  year after  such registration statement becomes effective, which
one year period  shall be  extended by the number of days that the sale of
Registrable Securities  is  suspended as described in Section 2.2) or (ii)
the expiration of the time  when a prospectus relating to such registration
is required to be delivered  under the Securities Act.

 

 

4.3. _Furnishing  of Copies of Registration Statements and Other
Documents_.  Furnish  to each seller of such Registrable Securities such
number of conformed  copies of  such registration statement and of each such
amendment and supplement  thereto  (in each case including all exhibits),
such number of copies of the  prospectus  included in such registration
statement (including each preliminary  prospectus  and any summary
prospectus), each in conformity with the requirements  of the  Securities
Act, such documents incorporated by reference in such registration  statement
or prospectus and such other documents as such seller may  reasonably 
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities 
of  such seller covered by such registration statement.

 

 

4.4. _State  Securities Laws_.  Use  commercially reasonable efforts to
register or qualify such Registrable  Securities under such securities or
"blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the  sellers shall reasonably
request, and do any and all other acts and  things which  may be necessary
or advisable to enable each seller to consummate the  disposition in such
jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities of  such seller  covered by such
registration statement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company shall
not be obligated to file any general consent to service  of  process or to
qualify as a foreign corporation or subject the Company  to  taxation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or would  not  otherwise be so
subject.

 

 

4.5. _Opinion  of Counsel_.  Use  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all legal opinions, auditors' consents  and expert's cooperation as may
reasonably be required.

 

 

4.6. _Notice  of Prospectus Defects_.  Promptly notify each seller of
Registrable Securities covered by such  registration statement, at any time
when a prospectus relating thereto  is  required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening  of any event  as a result of which the
prospectus included in such registration statement,  as  then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or  omits to  state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary  to make the 
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances  then 
existing, and at the request of any such seller prepare and furnish  to
such  seller a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an
amendment  of such  prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter
delivered to  the  purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus shall not  include an  untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact  required to  be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading  in  the light of the
circumstances then existing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

98  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.7. _Stop  Orders_.  In the  event of the issuance of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness  of such  registration statement, or any order
suspending or preventing the use  of any  related prospectus or suspending
the qualification of any Registrable  Securities  included in such
registration statement for sale in any jurisdiction,  the  Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts promptly to obtain  the  withdrawal of such
order.

 

 

4.8. _Exchange  Listing_.  Use  commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Registrable Securities  to be  listed on each securities exchange on
which any equity security of  the Company  is then listed.

 

 

5. _Additional  Procedures; Holder Lockups; Cutbacks; Other Agreements_.

 

 

5.1. _Piggyback  Registrations Pursuant to Section 3_.  In  connection with
the exercise of any registration rights granted to  Holders of  Registrable
Securities pursuant to Section 3 hereof, if the registration is  to be
effected by means of an underwritten offering of Common Stock  on a firm 
commitment basis, the Company may condition participation in such
registration  by such Holders upon inclusion of the Registrable Securities
being  so registered  in such underwriting. The Holders of Registrable
Securities participating  in any  registration pursuant to Section 3 shall
be parties to the underwriting  agreement and other agreements and
instruments entered into by the  Company and  any other selling stockholders
in connection therewith containing,  among other  things, such
representations and warranties by the Company and such  participating sellers
and such other terms and provisions as are customarily  contained in
underwriting agreements with respect to secondary distributions,  including,
without limitation, customary indemnity and contribution  provisions.

 

 

5.2. _Selling  Holder Lockups_.  In each  registration pursuant to Section
3 effected on a firm commitment underwritten  offering, each Holder agrees
that, as a condition to the inclusion  of any of  such Holder's Registrable
Securities in such offering, if reasonably requested  by the managing
underwriter, subject to any early release provisions  that apply  generally
to stockholders of the Company, such Holder shall not, for  a period  from
15 days prior to the effective date of the registration statement  until up 
to 90 days after such effective date, directly or indirectly sell,  offer
to  sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of any 
Common Stock  or securities convertible into Common Stock; _provided_   that
if  ( _i_ )  during  the last 17 days of the lock-up period, the Company
releases earnings  results or  publicly announces other material news or a
material event relating  to the  Company occurs or ( _ii_ )  prior  to the
expiration of the lock-up period, the Company announces that  it will 
release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the  last day
of  the lock-up period, then, in each case, the lock-up period will be 
extended  until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date
of  the earnings  results or the public announcement of the material news or
the occurrence  of the  material event, as applicable. If reasonably
requested by the managing  underwriter, each Holder shall confirm its
agreement as to the foregoing  in  writing in such form as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to such managing  underwriter.

 

 

5.3. _Cutbacks_.  If the  managing underwriter advises the Company that the
number of shares  to be  included in a registration pursuant to Section 3
should be limited  due to market  conditions or otherwise,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

99  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

if  the registration was initiated by the Company, ( _i_ )  all shares of
securities held by stockholders of the Company  other than  Holders of
Registrable Securities and Pari Passu Holders shall  first be  excluded, (
_ii_ )  next, if additional shares must be excluded from such registration, 
Holders of Registrable Securities and Pari Passu Holders shall  share pro 
rata in the number of shares of Registrable Securities to be  excluded from 
such registration pursuant to this clause, such sharing to  be based on the 
respective numbers of Registrable Securities owned by such  holders, and  (
_iii_ )  if additional shares must be excluded from such registration,

---|--- 
    

       (b)   |  

if  the registration was initiated by stockholders of the Company  other
than  Holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to registration  rights
granted  to such holders in compliance with Section 8, ( _i_ )  shares to be
issued by the Company shall first be excluded,  ( _ii_ )  next, if
additional shares must be excluded from such registration,  Holders of
Registrable Securities shall share pro rata in the  number of  shares of
Registrable Securities to be excluded from such registration  pursuant to
this clause (ii), such sharing to be based on the  respective  numbers of
Registrable Securities owned by such holders, and  ( _iii_ )  finally, if
additional shares must be excluded from such registration,  shares to be
registered by stockholders of the Company other  than Holders  of
Registrable Securities shall be excluded pro rata based  on the number  of

5.4. _Other  Agreements_.

 

 

5.4.1. _Participation  by Selling Holders_.  The  Company may require each
seller of Registrable Securities as to which  any  registration is being
effected to furnish the Company such information  regarding  such seller and
the distribution of such securities as the Company  may from time  to time
reasonably request in writing and which shall be required by  the 
Securities Act (or similar state laws) or by the Commission in connection 
therewith.

 

 

5.4.2. _Discontinue  Selling_.  Each  seller of Registrable Securities
agrees that, upon written notice of  the  happening of any event as a result
of which the Prospectus included  in any  registration statement contains an
untrue statement of a material fact  or omits  any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading,  or  upon the issuance of a
stop order suspending the effectiveness of any  registration statement, such
seller will use commercially reasonable  efforts to  forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until such  seller is  advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may  be resumed  and
if applicable is furnished with a supplemented or amended prospectus  as 
contemplated by Section 4.6 hereof. If the Company shall give any notice 
to  suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
prospectus,  the  Company shall extend the period of time during which the
Company is  required to  maintain the registration statement effective
pursuant to this Agreement  by the  number of days during the period from
and including the date of the  giving of  such notice to and including the
date such seller either is advised  by the  Company that the use of the
prospectus may be resumed or if applicable  receives  the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by  Section  4.6.

6. _Indemnification  and Contribution_.

 

 

6.1. _Indemnities  of the Company_.  In the  event of any registration of
any Registrable Securities under the Securities  Act  pursuant to Section 2
or 3 hereof, and in connection with any registration  statement or any other
disclosure document produced by or on behalf  of the  Company or any of its
subsidiaries including, without limitation, reports  required by and other
documents filed under the Exchange Act, and other  documents pursuant to
which any debt or equity securities of the Company  or any  of its
subsidiaries are sold (whether or not for the account of the  Company),  the
Company will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless each  seller of 
Registrable Securities, their respective direct and indirect partners, 
members,  stockholders, directors, advisory board members, officers,
representatives  on  the Board of Directors of the Company, and each other
Person, if any,  who  controls or is alleged to control any such seller
within the meaning  of  Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act (each  such Person being referred to herein as a "
_Covered  Person_ "),  against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions or proceedings  in  respect thereof), joint or several, to which
such Covered Person may  be or  become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any other  securities  or other law of any jurisdiction,
common law or otherwise, insofar  as such  losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in  respect  thereof) arise out of or
are based upon ( _i_ ) any  untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
any material fact contained  or  incorporated by reference in any
registration statement under the Securities  Act, any preliminary prospectus
or final prospectus included therein,  or any  related summary prospectus,
or any amendment or supplement thereto,  or any  document incorporated by
reference therein, or any other such disclosure  document (including without
limitation reports and other documents  filed under  the Exchange Act and
any document incorporated by reference therein)  or other  document or
report, or ( _ii_ ) any  omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required  to be  stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading,  or  (iii) any violation or alleged
violation of any federal, state, foreign  or  common law rule or regulation
applicable to the Company or any of its  subsidiaries and relating to action
or inaction in connection with  any such  registration, disclosure document
or other document or report, and  will  reimburse such Covered Person for
any legal or any other expenses incurred  by it  in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim,  damage,  liability, action
or proceeding; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company shall not be
liable to any Covered Person in any such case  for any  such loss, claim,
damage, liability, action or proceeding to the extent  that it  arises out
of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue  statement  or
omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement,  any such 
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment  or 
supplement, incorporated document or other such disclosure document  or
other  document or report, in reliance upon and in conformity with written 
information  furnished to the Company or any of its subsidiaries by or on
behalf  of such  Covered Person expressly for inclusion therein. The
indemnities of  the Company  contained in this Section 6.1 shall remain in
full force and effect  regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of such Covered  Person and  shall survive any transfer of Registrable
Securities.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

101  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.2. _Indemnities  to the Company_.  In the  event of any registration of
Registrable Securities pursuant to Section  2 or 3,  each selling Holder
will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless  the  Company, each
director of the Company, each officer of the Company  who shall  sign such
registration statement and each other Person (other than  such seller),  if
any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, with respect to any 
statement  in or omission from such registration statement, any preliminary
prospectus,  final prospectus or summary prospectus included therein, or any
amendment  or  supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference
therein,  or any  other such disclosure document (including without
limitation reports  and other  documents filed under the Exchange Act and
any document incorporated  by  reference therein) or other document or
report, if such statement or  omission  was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information  furnished  to the Company by or on
behalf of such seller expressly for inclusion  therein.  Such indemnity
contained in this Section 6.2 shall remain in full force  and  effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the  Company or  any
such director, officer or controlling Person and shall survive  any
transfer  of Registrable Securities.

 

 

6.3. _Indemnification  Procedures_.  Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement  of  any action or
proceeding involving a claim of the type referred to  in the  foregoing
provisions of this Section 6, such indemnified party will, if a  claim in
respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party,  give  written
notice to each such indemnifying party of the commencement  of such  action;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the failure of any indemnified party to
give notice to such indemnifying  party  as provided herein shall not
relieve such indemnifying party of its  obligations  under the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6, except and solely to the  extent that such
indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such  failure to  give notice.
In case any such action is brought against an indemnified  party,  each
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume  the 
defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly 
notified,  to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory  to such  indemnified party (who shall not, except with the
consent of the indemnified  party, be counsel to such an indemnifying party),
and after notice  from an  indemnifying party to such indemnified party of
its election so to  assume the  defense thereof, such indemnifying party
will not be liable to such  indemnified  party for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the  latter in  connection with the
defense thereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  ( _i_ ) if  there is a
material conflict between the positions of such indemnifying  party  and the
indemnified party in conducting the defense of such action  or that there 
may be defenses available to such indemnified party different from  or in 
addition to those available to such indemnifying party, then counsel  for
the  indemnified party shall conduct the defense to the extent in good
faith  determined by such counsel to be necessary to protect the interests 
of the  indemnified party and such indemnifying party shall employ separate 
counsel for  its own defense, ( _ii_ ) in  any event, the indemnified party
shall be entitled to have counsel  chosen by  such indemnified party
participate in, but not conduct, the defense  and  ( _iii_ ) the 
indemnifying party shall bear the legal expenses incurred in connection  with
the  conduct of, and the participation in, the defense as referred to in 
clauses (i) and (ii) above. If, within a reasonable time after receipt of 
the notice, such indemnifying party shall not have elected to assume  the
defense  of the action, such indemnifying party shall be responsible for
any  legal or  other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with  the defense  of the action, suit, investigation, inquiry or
proceeding. No indemnifying  party  will consent to entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement  which does  not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant  or  plaintiff to such indemnified party
of a release from all liability  in respect  to such claim or litigation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

102  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.4. _Contribution_.  If the  indemnification provided for in Sections 6.1
or 6.2 hereof is unavailable  to a party that would have been an indemnified
party under any such  Section in  respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or  proceedings  in respect thereof) referred to
therein, then each party that would  have been an  indemnifying party
thereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified  party, contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified  party as a  result of
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or  proceedings  in
respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect  the
relative  fault of such indemnifying party on the one hand and such
indemnified  party on  the other in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted  in such  losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions or proceedings in  respect  thereof). The relative fault shall
be determined by reference to, among  other  things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material  fact or the  omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information  supplied by such
indemnifying party or such indemnified party and the  parties\'  relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to  correct or 
prevent such statement or omission. The parties agree that it would  not be
just  and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.4 were
determined  by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does  not take  account of the equitable considerations referred to in the
preceding  sentence.  The amount paid or payable by a contributing party as
a result of the  losses,  claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect  thereof)  referred to above in this Section 6.4
shall include any legal or other  expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection  with  investigating or defending any such
action or claim. No party guilty  of  fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of  the  Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any party who  was not  guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

 

6.5. _Limitation  on Liability of Holders of Registrable Securities_.  The 
liability of each Holder in respect of any indemnification or contribution 
obligation of such Holder arising under this Section 6 shall not in any 
event exceed an amount equal to the net proceeds to such Holder (after 
deduction  of all underwriters\' discounts and commissions) from the
disposition  of the  Registrable Securities disposed of by such Holder
pursuant to such  registration  less any other damages paid by such Holder
with respect to claims relating  to  such registration.

 

 

7. _Assignment  of Registration Rights_.  The  rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant  to  Sections 2 and 3 may not be assigned by any Holder to a transferee;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that a  Holder may assign such rights to the members, partners or shareholders  of the  Holder in connection with the distribution of Registrable Securities  to such  members, partners or shareholders in proportion to their respective  ownership  interests in the Holder. Any transferee to whom rights under this Agreement are  transferred shall ( _i_ )  as a  condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument  by which  such transferee agrees to be bound by the obligations imposed upon  Holders under  this Agreement to the same extent as if such transferee were a Holder  under this  Agreement and ( _ii_ )  be  deemed to be a Holder hereunder to the same extent as the transferring  Holder.

 

 

8. _Limitation  on Subsequent Registration Rights_.  The  Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Holders  of a  majority of the Registrable Securities, enter into any agreement with  any holder  or prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would allow  such  holder or prospective holder to include securities of the Company in  any  registration statement, unless under the terms of such agreement such  holder or  prospective holder may include such securities in a registration statement  only  on terms pari passu or subordinate to the terms on which Holders of  Registrable  Securities may include shares in such registration.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

103  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9. _Future  Changes in Registration Requirements_.  In the  event that the registration requirements under the Securities Act are  amended or  eliminated to accommodate a "Company registration" or similar approach, this  Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to reflect  such  changes and the intent of the parties hereto with respect to the benefits  and  obligations of the parties, and in such connection, the Company shall  use  reasonable efforts to provide Holders of Registrable Securities equivalent  benefits to those provided under this Agreement.

 

 

10. _Notices_.  All  notices, requests, consents and other communica-tions required or permitted  hereunder shall be in writing and shall be hand delivered or mailed  postage  prepaid by registered or certified mail or by facsimile transmission  to the  Company at:

12. _Amendments,  Waivers and Consents_.  An  amendment to any provision in this Agreement may be made, and the observance  thereof may be waived, if the Company ( _a_ ) shall  obtain consent thereto in writing from the Holders of a majority of  the  Registrable Securities (the " _Required  Holders_ ")  and  ( _b_ ) shall  deliver copies of such consent to any Holders who did not execute the  same;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  without a Holder\'s consent, any such amendment or waiver shall not  treat such  Holder differently from any other Holder.

15. _Severability_.  If any  provision of this Agreement shall be found by any court of competent  jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereby waive  such  provision to the extent that it is found to be invalid or unenforceable.  Such  provision shall, to the maximum extent allowable by law, be modified  by such  court so that it becomes enforceable, and, as modified, shall be enforced  as any  other provision hereof, all the other provisions hereof continuing  in full force  and effect.

In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation  arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by  the parties  hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring  or  disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions  of  this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign  statute  or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The word "including"  shall  mean including without limitation. The parties hereto intend that each  representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have  independent  significance. 

 

 

18. _WAIVER  OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

 

TO  THE  EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED,
THE  SELLER AND  THE COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT NEITHER THE
COMPANY NOR  THE SELLER  WILL ASSERT, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY
ISSUE IN ANY PROCEEDING,  WHETHER  AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE, IN

OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT  OR THE  SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY

of this Section 18 constitute a material inducement upon which the  Seller
is  relying and will rely in entering into this Agreement. The Seller or 
the Company  may file an original counterpart or a copy of this Section 18
with  any court as  written evidence of the consent of the Seller and the
Company to the  waiver of  its right to trial by jury.

 

 

19. _Jurisdiction_.

 

 

Any  suit,  action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based  on any matter  arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement
or the transactions  contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or
state court  located in  the State of Delaware, and each of the parties
hereby consents to the  jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts  therefrom)  in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the  fullest  extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter  have to the  laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such  court or  that any such suit, action
or proceed-ing which is brought in any such  court has  been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action  or  proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether  within or  without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,  each  party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section  10 
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.
