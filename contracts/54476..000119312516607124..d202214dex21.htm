3 ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND BOOK-ENTRY SHARES

 

SECTION 2.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of
Company Common Stock; Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock:

 

(i) each share of common stock, $5.00 par value, of the Company (" _Company
Common Stock_ ") that is owned by the Company as treasury stock, if any, each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company, if any, and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub, if any, immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) subject to _Section 2.01(b)_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares to
be canceled and retired or converted in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(i)_
and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive (A) an amount in cash (without interest) equal to $51.00 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ") and (B) that number (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000 of a
share) of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock,
no par value, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in each case, payable as
provided in _Section 2.02_ , and, when so converted, shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the following:

 

(1) If the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount greater than $33.2283, then
the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.2709;

 

(2) If the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount greater than or equal to
$28.5918 but less than or equal to $33.2283, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $9.00 by (y) the
Average Parent Stock Price; or

 

(3) If the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount less than $28.5918, then
the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.3148; and

 

(iii) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Adjustments to Merger Consideratio_ n. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent (or any other
securities convertible therefor or exchangeable thereto) shall occur as a
result of any

 



4  reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, or any similar
event, in each case, other than pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent
items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
action.

SECTION 2.02 _Payment for Shares_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company to act as paying and exchange agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of
Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.01(a)(ii)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ , (i) an
aggregate amount of cash and an aggregate amount of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration (together
with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 2.02(i))_ and (ii) the aggregate amount of Stock
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_. In addition, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, (i) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.02(j)_ and (ii) cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.02(i)_. All shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash, together with the amount of any such cash
dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
_Section 2.02(a)_, shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_."

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than two (2) Business Days
after the Effective Time), the Exchange Agent will mail to each holder of
record of a certificate representing outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Certificate_ ") and to
each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "),
in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_:

(1) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and that risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares held by such holder will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, and

 



5 (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares.

(ii) Upon surrender to, and acceptance in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)(iii)_ by, the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the
holder thereof will be entitled to the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered under this Agreement. Until such
time as the Merger Consideration is issued to or at the direction of the
holder of a surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, the Parent Common
Stock that constitutes a portion thereof shall not be voted on any matter.

(iii) The Exchange Agent will accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with customary exchange practices. 

(iv) From and after the Effective Time, no further transfers may be made on
the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and if any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the
Company for transfer, such Certificate of Book-Entry Share shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(v) If any Merger Consideration is to be remitted to a name other than that
in which a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, no Merger
Consideration may be paid in exchange for such surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share unless:

 

(1) either (A) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer or (B) the
Book-Entry Share is properly transferred; and

(2) the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(vi) At any time after the Effective Time until surrendered as contemplated by
this  _Section 2.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)(ii)_. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



6 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, and each holder of
Book-Entry Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock, except, to the extent provided by _Section 2.01_ ,
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_ ;

 

(ii) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this  _Section 2.02_
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than the right to receive dividends
or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section 2.02(j)_).

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent will deliver to the
Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporations demand, any portion of
the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all such funds) which remains undistributed to the
former holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration of the
period ending one (1) year after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares prior to the Merger who has not
complied with this _Section 2.02_ prior to such time, may look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of his, her or its claim for Merger
Consideration to which such holder may be entitled.

 

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of
a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000, or in
mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the cash component of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the Companys shareholders
to receive the Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein.
To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments or the cash
component of the Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level
required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required to be
paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the cash
component of the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments.

 



7 (f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Company Restricted Share Units, Company
Performance Units or Other Equity-Based Rights such amounts for Taxes as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
promptly paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, and shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Company Restricted Share Units, Company
Performance Units or Other Equity-Based Rights, as applicable, in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as relevant, shall provide advance notice
of any requirement to withhold and deduct Taxes, and shall obtain from holders
of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Company Restricted Share Units, Company
Performance Units or Other Equity-Based Rights such certificates or other
documents required to avoid or reduce any such Taxes.

 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver and pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.01_, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section 2.02(i)_, all fractional
shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated
and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any
such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount
in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product
of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled under _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ (or
would be entitled but for this _Section 2.02(i)_) and (B) an amount equal to
the Average Parent Stock Price. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company
Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock,
the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without interest, to
the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash.

 



8 (j) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions
shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest and subject to
any required Tax withholding, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

SECTION 2.03 _Equity Awards_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary (including obtaining any resolutions
of the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Company Stock Plan) to effect the following:

 

(a) _Company Restricted Share Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Restricted Share Unit that is outstanding and unvested

rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the (A) the Average Parent Stock Price
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, _plus_ (iii) the amount of any dividend
equivalents associated with such Company Restricted Share Unit as of the
Effective Time, subject to any withholding Taxes required by Law to be

respect to any Company Restricted Share Units shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date.

(b) _Company Performance Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Performance Unit that is outstanding and unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and
converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to (i)
the Cash Consideration, _plus_ (ii) the amount in cash, without interest,
rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the (A) the Average Parent Stock Price
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, _plus_ (iii) the amount of any dividend
equivalents associated with such Company Performance Unit as of the Effective
Time, with the number of vested Company Performance Units to be the greater of
the target award or the number determined in accordance with the
performance criteria provided in the applicable award agreement, subject to
any withholding Taxes required by Law to be withheld in accordance with
_Section 2.02(g)_. In each case, payment with respect to any Company
Performance Units shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date.

 



9 (c) _Other Equity-Based Rights._ Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each contractual right to receive a share of Company Common Stock or
the value of such a share other than Company Restricted Share Units and
Company Performance Units (each, an " _Other Equity-Based Right_ ") granted
pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall, without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest in full, and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions
or repurchase rights) otherwise applicable to such Other Equity-Based Right
shall lapse, and each Other Equity-Based Right shall be cancelled as of the
Effective Time and converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount
equal to (i) the Cash Consideration,  _plus_ (ii) the amount in cash, without
interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the (A) the Average Parent
Stock Price multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, _plus_ (iii) the amount of
any dividend equivalents associated with such Other Equity-Based Right as of
the Effective Time, subject to any withholding Taxes required by Law to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 2.02(g)_. In each case, payment with
respect to any Other Equity-Based Rights shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the

within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, payment shall occur on the
date that it would otherwise occur under the applicable Company Benefit Plan
or election form absent the application of this _Section 2.03(c)_ to the
extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalty or other taxes under
Section 409A of the Code.

(d) _Termination of Company Stock Plan_. After the Effective Time, the
Company Stock Plan shall be terminated and no further Company Restricted Share
Units or Company Performance Units shall be granted thereunder.

holder who is entitled to, and who has properly preserved, appraisal rights

Share_ ") will not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01_ and _Section
2.02_, and the holder of such share will be entitled only to such rights as
may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 17-6712 of the KGCC with
respect to such share; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such appraisal rights
have not been perfected or the holder of such share has otherwise lost such
holders appraisal rights with respect to such share, then, as of the later
of the Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such rights or the
loss of such rights, such share will automatically be converted into and will
represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the Certificate
representing such share or Book-Entry Share) the applicable Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01_ and _Section 2.02_.

 

(b) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 17-6712 of the KGCC and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand.

purposes in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. The Company
maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" required by Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are effective in all material respects to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure
documents. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys outside auditors and
the audit committee of the Company Board (1) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud,
known to the Company, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting.

SECTION 4.06 _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) Parent has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated
therein) required to be furnished or filed by Parent or Parent Utility Sub
with the SEC since January 1, 2014 (such documents, together with all
exhibits, financial statements, including the Parent Financial Statements,
and schedules thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference,
but excluding the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, being collectively referred to
as the " _Parent Reports_ "). Each Parent Report (i) at the time furnished or
filed, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to such Parent Report and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended
or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement,
then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent Reports
(the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") complied at the time it was filed as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods and as of the dates involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presents in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP, the consolidated financial position of
Parent and Parents consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments).

 



29 (b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liability of any nature
that is required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, except liabilities (i) reflected or
reserved against in the most recent balance sheet (including the notes
thereto) of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries included in the Parent Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business after March 31, 2016, (iii) incurred in connection with the Merger or
any other transaction or agreement contemplated by this Agreement or (iv)
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Parent maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act).
Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP in all material respects. Parent maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for
the preparation of Parents filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents outside auditors
and the audit committee of the Parent Board (1) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, known to
Parent, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial
reporting.

the Parent Subsidiaries has conducted its respective business in the ordinary

occurred any fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or development that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 4.08 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.08_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, there is no Claim before any Governmental Entity
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent, Merger Sub
or any Parent Subsidiary that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material 

 



30  Adverse Effect. There is no Judgment outstanding against or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental Entity of Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 4.09 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Except as would not have or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

are in compliance with all applicable Laws (including Anti-Corruption Laws)
and all material Permits applicable to the business and operations of Parent,
Merger Sub and Parent Subsidiaries and (b) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary
hold, and are in compliance with, all Permits required by Law for the conduct
of their respective businesses as they are now being conducted. None

SECTION 4.10 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and
complete fully executed copies of (a) the commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof, among Parent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending
Partners LLC (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") and (b) the fee letter, among
Parent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, dated
as of the date hereof (as redacted to remove only the fee amounts, pricing
caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex"), in each case,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letters in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Letters_
"), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, each of
the parties thereto (other than Parent) has severally committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein to Parent (the provision of such funds as set forth
therein, the " _Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such Debt Letters.
The Debt Letters have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than to
add lenders, arrangers, agents, bookrunners, managers and other financing
sources), and the respective commitments contained in the Debt Letters have
not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any
respect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. As of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Debt Letters are in full force
and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and the other parties thereto, subject in each case to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent or contingencies
directly or indirectly related to the funding of the Financing pursuant to
the Debt Letters, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Letters.
Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Debt Letters will provide at
the Closing Parent and Merger Sub, together with available cash,
with sufficient funds to pay all of Parents obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Cash Consideration and all fees and
expenses expected to be incurred in connection therewith. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent under
the Debt Letters or any other party to the Debt Letters that would (a) result
in any of the conditions in the Debt Letters not being satisfied or (b)
otherwise result in the Financing not being available, other than such default
or

 



31  breach that has been waived by the Lenders or otherwise cured in a timely
manner by Parent or Merger Sub to the satisfaction of the Lenders, as the case
may be. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other
agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings (written or oral)
directly or indirectly related to the funding of the Financing that could
affect the conditionality, principal amount or availability of the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Letters. Parent has fully paid
all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date
of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. Assuming the accuracy of
the Companys representations and warranties contained herein, as of the date
of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters will not be satisfied on a
timely basis or that the Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters will not
be made available on the Closing Date.

Sub has no assets, liabilities or obligations and has not, since the date of

each case, as arising from the execution of this Agreement, the

SECTION 4.13 _Ownership of Company Common Stock; Interested Shareholder_.
Neither Parent, any Parent Subsidiary nor any other Affiliate of Parent
"beneficially owns" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or any other Equity
Securities. Neither Parent, any Parent Subsidiary nor any of their respective
affiliates or associates (as each such term is defined in Section 17-1297 of

requirements of applicable statutes and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, except for Filings the failure of which to make or the failure of

Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 5.03 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not authorize any of its Affiliates or
any of its and their respective officers, directors, principals, partners,
managers, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, employees, consultants,
financial advisors or other authorized representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Company Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal, in each case, except for this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (except for the
Companys Affiliates and its

 



39  and their respective Representatives or Parent and Parents Affiliates and

Person, any nonpublic information with respect to, or cooperate in any way
with any such Person with respect to, any Company Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (except

conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a
bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal made after the date of this
Agreement that does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach)
of this _Section 5.03(a)_ by the Company and that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal, the Company and its Representatives may (1)
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
( _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Parent
or is provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the provision of such
information to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
and (2) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Company
Takeover Proposal, including terms of a Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect thereto, and the negotiation of such terms with the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.03(a)_ by any Representative of the Company or
any of its Affiliates, in each case, at the Companys direction, shall
constitute a breach of this _Section 5.03(a)_ by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or
release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent
necessary to allow a confidential Company Takeover Proposal to be made to the
Company or the Company Board so long as the Company Board promptly (and in any
event, within one Business Day) notifies Parent thereof after granting any
such waiver, amendment or release.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_ , _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section
5.03(e)_ , and except for the public disclosure of a Company Recommendation

or propose publicly to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt,
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to include in the

with a tender offer or exchange offer (except for a recommendation against
such offer or 

 



40  a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (any action in the foregoing clauses
(i)(iv) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_ , _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section
5.03(e)_ , neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to authorize,
permit, approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, agreement or commitment constituting, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or
requiring, or that would reasonably be expected to cause, the Company to
abandon or terminate this Agreement (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, solely with respect to a Superior
Company Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(i)_)
if (i) a Company Intervening Event has occurred or (ii) the Company has
received a Superior Company Proposal that does not result from a breach (other
than an immaterial breach) of _Section 5.03_ by the Company and, in each
case, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) that the failure to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the occurrence of such
Company Intervening Event or in response to the receipt of such Superior
Company Proposal, as the case may be, would reasonably likely be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board may not make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless (1) the Company Board has provided prior written
notice to Parent (a " _Company Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is
prepared to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change at least three (3)
Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice shall specify the
basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, attaching the most current draft of any Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Company Proposal or, if
no draft exists, a summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Company Proposal (it being understood that such Company
Recommendation Change Notice shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and that if Parent has committed in writing to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement and there has been any subsequent
material revision or amendment to the terms of a Superior Company Proposal, a
new notice to which the provisions of clauses (2), (3) and (4) of this
_Section 5.03(c)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ except that, in the case of
such a new notice, all references to three (3) Business Days in this 
_Section 5.03(c)_ shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days), (2) during
the three (3) Business Day period after delivery of the Company Recommendation
Change Notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this Agreement
that Parent proposes to make and (3) at the end of such three (3) Business Day
period and taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement committed to in writing by Parent, the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor) that the failure to make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its

 



41  fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and that, in the case of a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal,
such Company Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Company Proposal.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than the later
of (i) twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the next
Business Day) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects on a reasonably current basis (and in any event no later than the
later of (i) twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the
next Business Day) of the material terms and status (including any change to
the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the Company from
(i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in
the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

not in writing), with respect to any (1) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,

of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (3) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or
indirectly, to any Person (or the shareholders of any Person) or group of
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the Company, (4) transaction (including any
tender offer or exchange offer) in which any Person (or the shareholders of
any Person) would acquire (in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer, if
consummated), directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially
owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of any
class of capital stock of the Company or (5) any combination of the

Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this definition, the

42  after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, and
taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects
of such Company Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person making the
proposal and any financing required for such proposal, the ability of the
Person making such proposal to obtain such required financing and the level of
certainty with respect to such required financing, and such other factors
that are deemed relevant by the Company Board, is more favorable to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that are committed to in writing by Parent (including pursuant to
_Section 5.03(c)_ ).

(iii) " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any fact, circumstance, effect,
change, event or development relating to the Company or the Company

reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed closing date and
material terms of the definitive documentation related to the Financing,
providing copies of substantially final drafts of the credit agreement and
other primary definitive documents ( _provided_  that any fee letter may be
redacted) and giving the Company prompt notice of any material breach or
default (or alleged or purported material breach or default) by any party to
the Debt Letters of which Parent has become aware or any termination
or repudiation (or alleged or purported termination or repudiation) of the
Debt Letters.

(d) Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under
the Debt Letters (including to add lenders, arrangers, agents, bookrunners,
managers and other financing sources) without the prior written approval of
the Company; _provided_ that Parent shall not, without Companys prior
written consent, permit any such amendment, modification, assignment,
termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to any waiver of, any
provision of or remedy under the Debt Letters which would (1) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount unless Parent has available cash to fund
any additional fees or original issue discount without affecting Parents
ability to pay the Cash Consideration), (2) impose new or additional
conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend,

 



47  modify or waive any of the conditions to the Financing or (3) otherwise
expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Letters in a manner
that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less
likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date, (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the Financing Parties or any other parties to the
Debt Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (C)
adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that new debt or equity
commitment letters or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Letters
permitted pursuant to this _Section 5.05(d)_ , such new commitment letters or
fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and deemed to be
the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Letters ( _provided_ that any
fee letter may be redacted).

(e) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion
thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to (i) notify
the Company in writing thereof, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain substitute financing sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its
terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and (iii) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for such
Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the
Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and
the related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably satisfactory to the
Persons providing such Substitute Financing removing only the fee amounts,
pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex") and
related definitive financing documents with respect to such Substitute
Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Substitute Financing shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (1) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount), (2) impose new or additional
conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of
the conditions of the Financing, in a manner that would be reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, as compared to the Debt Letters in effect on
the date hereof, or (3) otherwise be on terms that are less favorable to
Parent in the aggregate than those contained in the Debt Letters as in effect
on the date hereof. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute
Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and
any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be deemed the "Debt
Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Debt Letters.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parents
nor Merger Subs obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Financing or any
other financing.

 



48 SECTION 5.06 _Financing Cooperation_.

Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ ), subject to the limitations set forth

will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, use its or

solely for purposes of this _Section 5.06_ and the use of the term Financing
Party in this _Section 5.06_, shall include any alternative equity or debt
financings, all or a portion of which will be used to fund the Cash
Consideration). Such cooperation will include using reasonable best efforts

drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions and cooperate with
the Financing (including as set forth in the Debt Letters as in effect on the
date of this Agreement) or in connection with a customary offering of
securities, including the type described in the Commitment Letter, consistent
with their customary practice, including requesting that they provide
customary consents and comfort letters (including "negative assurance"
comfort) to the extent required in connection with the marketing and
syndication of the Financing (including as set forth in the Debt Letters as
in effect on the date of this Agreement) or as are customarily required in an
offering of securities of the type contemplated by the Financing;

 



49 (iv) obtain or provide certificates and other customary documents (other
than legal opinions) relating to the Financing as reasonably requested by

within the control of, the Company;

 

(vi) furnish all documentation and other information required by a
Governmental Entity or any Financing Party under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT ACT (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)),
to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser at least 10 Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date;

(vii) assist Parent in obtaining any credit ratings from rating
agencies contemplated by the Debt Letters; and

(viii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents, waivers,

Company with respect to such period or (3) any financial information with
respect to a month or fiscal period that has not yet ended or has ended less
than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of such request.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this  _Section 5.06_ ): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including
this _Section 5.06_ ) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it
would (1) require the Company to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse
any expenses or otherwise incur any liabilities or give any indemnities prior
to the Closing, (2) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (3) require the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any agreement or

and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing in a form and
manner mutually agreed with the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely,
to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of any of the foregoing.

 



50 (c) Parent shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse

_Section 5.06_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives against any claim, loss,

with, such cooperation or the Financing and any information used in
connection therewith other than those claims, losses, damages, injuries,
liabilities, judgments, awards, penalties, fines, costs, expenses and
settlement payment arising out of or resulting from the gross negligence,
fraud or willful misconduct of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other written
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press

59 SECTION 6.09 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as provided in their respective Organization Documents and
any indemnification or other similar Contracts of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms (it being
agreed that after the Closing such rights shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, if applicable), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Subsidiaries to perform their respective obligations
thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or who is as of the date of this Agreement,
or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the
request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or
employee of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Claim, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising
out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was
a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
director, officer or employee of another Person, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law. In the event of any Claim covered under this _Section
6.09_, (i) each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such Claim from Parent; _provided_
that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and
only to the extent required by applicable Law or the Surviving Corporations
Organizational Documents, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in good
faith in the defense of any such matter.

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the covenants and
agreements set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by 

 



60  the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for the
Company and its current and former directors and officers who are currently
covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company, in either case, of not less than
the existing coverage and having other terms not materially less favorable to
the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by
A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in
respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium
most recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 6.09(c)_ it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six (6) year period
for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy
year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date
the Company may, at its option, purchase a "tail" directors and officers
liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the
Company and its current and former directors, officers and employees who are
currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, such tail to provide
coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other
terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than the directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time for a period of not
less than six (6) years; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of
any such tail policy in respect of any one policy year exceed the Maximum
Amount. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

SECTION 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the two
(2) year anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
individual who is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed thereafter by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") who is not a Represented Employee (as defined in _Section
6.10(b)_ ) with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than
that provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,

 



61  (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the Continuation
Period, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide
each Company Employee who experiences a termination of employment with the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries severance benefits
that are no less favorable than those set forth in  _Section 6.10(a)(1)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. During the two (2) year period following the
Closing Date, subject to _Section 6.10(d)(ii)_, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, treat retirees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to the provision of post-retirement welfare benefits
no less favorably than similarly situated retirees of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Except as provided on _Section 6.10(a)(2)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as soon as practicable following the end of the
fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay each Company Employee who remains employed
with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries through
the applicable payment date an annual cash bonus for such fiscal year in an
amount determined based on the level of attainment of the applicable
performance criteria under the bonus plan in which such Company Employee
participated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) With respect to each Company Employee who is covered by a Company Union
Contract (each, a " _Represented Employee_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to honor the Company Union Contracts,
in each case as in effect at the Effective Time, in accordance with their
terms (it being understood that this sentence shall not be construed to limit
the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any
such Company Union Contract, to the extent permitted by the terms of the
applicable Company Union Contract and applicable Law). The provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ shall be subject to any applicable provisions of the Company
Union Contracts and applicable Law in respect of such Represented Employee,
to the extent the provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are inconsistent with or
otherwise in conflict with the provisions of any such Company Union Contract
or applicable Law. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide, to
the extent required by applicable Law, sufficient advance notice of the
transactions contemplated hereby to any unions that are party to a Company
Union Contract, and, in response to a request from any such union to engage in
bargaining over the effect of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
engage in meaningful, good-faith bargaining, to the extent required by
applicable Law.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the
Companys and all of the Company Subsidiaries employment, severance,
retention, termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change-in-control severance
agreement or other arrangement between the Company and any Company Employee)
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Merger (either alone or in combination
with

 



62  any other event), it being understood that this sentence shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend
or terminate any such plans, policies, programs, agreements, or arrangements,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement and applicable Law. For purposes of any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement containing a definition of "change
in control," "change of control" or similar term that relates to a transaction
at the level of the Company, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control," "change of control" or such similar term.

(d) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans), each Company Employees service with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service
with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary and is accurately reflected within a Company Employees records)
shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, except (i) to
the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) for
purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan, any retiree welfare benefit
plan, any grandfathered or frozen plan or any plan under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (iii) to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no provision of this _Section 6.10_ is intended to, or shall, constitute
the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan
for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no Company Personnel or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for

 



63  any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right
to enforce the provisions hereof including in respect of continued employment
(or resumed employment). Nothing contained herein shall alter the at-will
employment relationship of any Company Employee.

SECTION 6.11 _Merger Sub_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activity
of any nature except for activities related to or in furtherance of the
Merger.

(b) Parent hereby (i) guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment
performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and compliance by Merger Sub
with, all of the covenants and agreements of Merger Sub under this Agreement
and (ii) agrees to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to ensure
such payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub hereunder.

SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, the Company
and the Company Board shall use reasonable best efforts to grant such
approvals and take such actions to ensure that the Merger may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.13 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with the foregoing, including
by providing information reasonably requested by Parent in connection
therewith.

 

SECTION 6.14 _Parent Equity Transactions_. In connection with the alternative
equity financing contemplated by  _Section 5.06_, at such times prior to the
Effective Time and to the extent that Parent shall determine advisable: (a)
Parent shall redeem all of the outstanding Parent Preferred Par Value Stock;
and (b) Parent shall engage in the equity financing transactions set forth in
_Section 6.14_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained at the Company
Shareholders Meeting; or

 

(ii) if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or
agreements contained herein, or if any of the representations or warranties
of the Company contained herein fails to be true and correct, which breach or
failure (1) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_ , as applicable, and (2) is not
reasonably capable of being cured by the Company by the End Date (as it may be
extended pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ ) or is not cured by the Company
within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such breach or
failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ if Parent or Merger
Sub is then in breach of any representation, covenant or agreement contained
herein such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section
7.02(b)_ , as applicable, could not then be satisfied.

Closing set forth in _Section 7.01(a)_ , _Section 7.03(a)_ ,  _Section
7.03(b)_ and _Section 7.03(c)_ shall have been satisfied or waived (except for
(I) those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing
but which conditions would be satisfied or would be capable of
being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination or (II)
those conditions that have not been satisfied as a result of a breach of this

prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, and (3) within twelve
(12) months after the termination of this

 



70  Agreement, the Company shall have entered into a Company Acquisition
Agreement which is subsequently consummated, or consummated a Company Takeover
Proposal, then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent
(to an account designated in writing by Parent) within three (3) Business Days
after the earlier of the date the Company enters into such Company Acquisition
Agreement or consummates such Company Takeover Proposal. For purposes of
clause (3) of this _Section 8.02(b)(iv)_, the term "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.03_,
except that the applicable percentage in the definition of "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall be "50.1%" rather than "20% or more".

(v) If (1) either (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.01(b)(iv)_ or (B) the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(ii)_, (2) a Parent
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or made to Parent after

(vi) If either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)(iv)_ and no fee is then payable pursuant to _Section
8.02(b)(i)_, _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(v)_, then Parent
shall pay to the Company a fee of $80,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent No Vote
Termination Fee_ "). Parent shall pay the Parent No Vote Termination Fee to
Company (to an account designated in writing by Company) prior to or

_Section 8.01(b)(iv)_ or no later than three (3) Business Days after the date
of such termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(iv)_.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section
8.02(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If Parent fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.02(b)(i)_,  _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_, _Section 8.02(b)(v)_ or
_Section 8.02(b)(vi)_ or the Company fails to promptly pay an amount due
pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(iv)_ , and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a

 



71  Claim that results in a Judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(iv)_ or any portion
thereof, or a Judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section
8.02(b)(i)_ , _Section 8.02(b)(iii) _Section 8.02(b)(v), or _Section
8.02(b)(vi)_ or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, on the
one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and the fees and expenses
of any expert or consultant engaged by the Company) in connection with such
Claim, together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date
such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the U.S.
prime rate as quoted by The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. Any amount payable pursuant to  _Section
8.02(b)_ shall be paid by the applicable Party by wire transfer of same-day
funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to be made under
_Section 8.02(b)_.

 

(d) Without limiting the rights of the Company under _Section 9.10_ prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, if this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Parent is obligated to
pay the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 8.02(b)(i)_ or Parent Fiduciary
Out Termination Fee under  _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(v)_
or the Parent No Vote Termination Fee under _Section 8.02(b)(vi)_, except as
otherwise contemplated by the last sentence of this _Section 8.02(d)_, upon
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Fiduciary Termination Fee
or the Parent No Vote Termination Fee, as the case may be, and, if applicable,
the costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_ in
accordance herewith, Parent, Parent Subsidiaries and any of the Financing
Source Parties and their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall have
no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing, to the Company or the holders
of the Company Common Stock, and payment of the applicable fee and such costs
and expenses by Parent shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy for
any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
or any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing (and the
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
the Company shall not have, and expressly waives and relinquishes, any other
right, remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or
whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity),
including against any Financing Source Party; _provided_ that, regardless of
whether Parent pays or is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee, the
Parent Fiduciary Out Termination Fee or the Parent No Vote Termination Fee,
nothing in this _Section 8.02(d)_ shall release Parent from liability for a
Willful Breach of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated under
circumstances in which the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination
Fee under _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(iv)_, upon payment of the
Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_ in accordance herewith, the Company shall have
no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, and payment of the Company Termination Fee and
such costs and expenses by the Company shall be Parents sole and exclusive
remedy for any

 



72  Claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent, Parents Subsidiaries and any
other Person in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby (and the termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not have, and each expressly
waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ that, regardless of whether
the Company pays or is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee, nothing
in this _Section 8.02(d)_ shall release the Company from liability for a
Willful Breach of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
in no event shall the Company or Parent, as applicable, be required to pay
the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Fiduciary
Out Termination Fee or the Parent No Vote Termination Fee, as applicable, on
more than one occasion, (ii) the Parent Fiduciary Out Termination Fee may
become due and payable pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)(v)_ after the prior
payment of the Parent No Vote Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.02(b)(vi)_, in which case Parent shall be obligated to pay an amount equal
to the Parent Fiduciary Out Termination Fee less the amount of the Parent No
Vote Fee previously paid and (iii) if a termination event occurs requiring
Parent to pay a termination fee hereunder and at such time more than one
right to terminate this Agreement is exercisable by the Parties, Parent shall
be obligated to pay the largest termination fee that would be applicable
without regard to which termination right was actually exercised (e.g.,
if termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iv)_ and _Section 8.01(c)(iv)_
is permitted, Parent shall be obligated to pay the Parent Fiduciary Out
Termination Fee even if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 8.01(b)(iv)_).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means a breach that
is a consequence of a deliberate act or deliberate failure to act undertaken
by the breaching Party with the Knowledge that the taking of, or failure to
take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute
a material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ that, without limiting the meaning of Willful Breach, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that any failure by any Party to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby after the applicable
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the
time of such failure to consummate the Merger) shall constitute a Willful
Breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in the event that
all applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ have been
satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Merger) but Parent
fails to close for any reason, such failure to close shall be considered a
Willful Breach and (ii) the availability or unavailability of financing for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have no effect on
Parents obligations hereunder. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
without in any way limiting the Parties rights under _Section 9.10_,
recoverable damages of the Company hereunder shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs but shall also include the
benefit of the bargain lost by the Company

 



73  and its shareholders (including "lost premium"), taking into consideration
relevant matters, including the total consideration and value to be received
by the shareholders of each Party under this Agreement and the time value of
money, which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company and
shall be recoverable by the Company on behalf of itself or its shareholders.

 

SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_
, _however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such
shareholders, (b) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time, (c) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement
shall require the approval of the shareholders of Parent or the shareholders
of the Company and (d) no amendments to or waivers of any DFS Provision shall
be effective without the written consent of the Financing Parties. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

SECTION 8.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) subject to _Section 8.03(a)_ , waive
compliance with any covenants and agreements contained herein or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

SECTION 8.05 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.03_ or an extension or waiver pursuant
to _Section 8.04_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its respective board of directors or
the duly authorized designee of its board of directors. Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
shareholders of any Party. The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01_ shall give written notice of such termination to
the other Parties in accordance with _Section 9.02_, specifying the provision
of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is effected.

limitation."

 



76 (f) _Hereof_. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and

Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

integral part of this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent may, at its
option, include in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter, respectively, items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts
herein or in the Disclosure Letters, shall not be deemed to be an

SECTION 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or

under this _Section 9.05 _

 



77  with respect thereto. Upon any determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

to the end that transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
Financing Parties and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective
current, former and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, assignees or representatives (collectively, the " _Financing
Source Parties_ ") shall be express third-party beneficiaries with respect to
_Section 8.02(d)_ , _Section 8.03(d)_ , this _Section 9.07_ , _Section 9.08_ ,
_Section 9.11(b)_ and _Section 9.12_ (collectively, the " _DFS Provisions_ ").

 

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or

78 SECTION 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void;  _provided_ that Parent may make as assignment of
its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any Financing
Party without the prior written consent of the Company. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

SECTION 9.10  _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause each other Party to

actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. If any Party brings any Claim to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the End Date
shall automatically be extended by the period of time between the commencement
of such Claim and the date on which such Claim is fully and finally resolved.

SECTION 9.11 _Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 

(a) All Claims arising from, under or in connection with this Agreement shall

District Court for the District of Kansas, to whose jurisdiction and venue the
Parties unconditionally consent and submit. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of Claim arising
out of this Agreement in such court and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such Claim brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each Party further agree that service of any process, summons, notice
or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in
_Section 9.02_  hereof shall be effective service of process for any Claim
brought against such Party in any such court.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this _Section 9.11_ ), each Party agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law

 



79  or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Source Parties in any way relating to this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of the Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the
Financing, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom).

SECTION 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER (INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING
SOURCE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, THE DEBT LETTERS, THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH
RESPECT THERETO). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Construction_. Each of the Parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.14 _Liability of Financing Source Parties_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that neither it nor any
other Company Related Party (other than Parent and the Merger Sub) shall have
any rights or claims against any Financing Source Parties in connection with
this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and no Financing Source Parties shall have any rights or claims
against any Company Related Party (other than Parent and the Merger Sub) in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise; _provided_ that, following consummation of the Merger, the

REGULATORY COMMITMENTS

Parent agrees that the initial application submitted to the Kansas
Corporation Commission with respect to the Merger will include specific
commitments and agreements consistent with the items set forth below.

 

Although the Merger is not subject to an approval proceeding in Missouri,
Parent would expect to make similar commitments and agreements for the benefit
of the Missouri customers of its utility subsidiaries in the context of
future rate case proceedings of its utility subsidiaries before the Missouri
Public Service Commission.



     | 1. | _Customer rates_ 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | _Transaction costs and acquisition premium_  Parent will
agree not to seek rate recovery of any transaction costs (including advisory
fees), acquisition premiums, goodwill or control premiums or fees incurred in
connection with the transaction. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | _Rate case filing plans_  Parent plans, consistent with its
current business plan for its electric utilities, to file general rate
proceedings for each of those electric utilities and anticipates filing
a general rate proceeding for the acquired utility subsidiaries consistent
with its current business plans. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | _Allocation of costs among affiliates_  Parent agrees that
each of its utility subsidiaries will provide an updated cost allocation
manual to the Kansas Corporation Commission explaining the basis
of allocation factors used to assign costs to each utility, and will further
agree that the Kansas Corporation Commission may examine accounting records of
its affiliates to determine the reasonableness of such allocation factors and
cost assignments.  
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | _Financial integrity_ 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | _Protection from adverse capital cost impacts_  Parent will
agree that its subsidiary utilities capital costs used to set rates shall not
increase as a result of the transaction. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | _Transaction financing_  Parent will agree that its
subsidiaries utility customers shall not bear any financing costs associated
with the transaction, including, but not limited to, any interest
expense associated with any debt issued to finance the transaction and any
replacement or refinancing of such debt. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | _Capital structures of Parent and utility subsidiaries_ 
Parent and its utility subsidiaries will maintain separate capital structures
to finance the activities and operations of each entity unless
otherwise approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission. Parent and its
utility subsidiaries will maintain separate debt, which is separately rated by
national credit rating agencies, so that none will be responsible for the
debts of affiliated companies and separate preferred stock, if any, unless
otherwise authorized by the Kansas Corporation Commission. Parent and its
utility subsidiaries will maintain investment grade credit ratings. 
---|---|--- 
 



B-1 utility subsidiaries shall not guarantee notes (or enter into make-well
agreements, etc.) of one another, or Parent or any of Parents
other affiliates, absent prior approval of the Kansas Corporation Commission;
that no utility stock or assets shall be pledged as collateral for obligations
of any entity other than the utility absent prior approval of the Kansas
Corporation Commission; and that each utility subsidiary shall be held
harmless from any business and financial risk exposures associated with
another utility subsidiary, Parent or its other affiliates. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 3. | _Capital requirements_  Parent acknowledges that its
utility subsidiaries (existing and proposed) need significant amounts of
capital to invest in energy supply and delivery infrastructure (including, but
not limited to, renewable energy resources and other environmental
sustainability initiatives such as energy efficiency and demand response
programs) and acknowledges that meeting these capital requirements of its
utility subsidiaries will be considered a high priority by Parents board of
directors and executive management and that Parents access to capital post-
transaction will permit it and its utility subsidiaries to satisfy all of such
capital requirements. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 4. | _Service quality and reliability_  Parent will agree to
reasonable conditions, including compliance with KCC standards issued in
Docket No. 02-GIME-365-GIE, regarding customer service quality
and reliability reporting. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5. | _Books, records and information_  Parent agrees that it and
its utility subsidiaries and other affiliates will maintain separate books and
records and that Parent will agree to reasonable conditions regarding access
by regulators to information, books and records. 
---|---|--- 



     | 6. | _Collective bargaining_  Parent will honor all existing
collective bargaining agreements. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7. | _Low-income assistance_  Parent will agree that each of its
utility subsidiaries will maintain and promote low-income assistance programs
consistent with those in place prior to the transaction.  
---|---|--- 



     | 8. | _Charitable and community involvement_  Parent will
maintain aggregate Kansas charitable contributions and community support at
2015 levels for at least five years after closing of the transaction.  
---|---|---
