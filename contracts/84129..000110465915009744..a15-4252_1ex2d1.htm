(b) If the Sellers Representative shall disagree with the calculation of the
Interim EBITDA Amount, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the amount of
Transaction Expenses, any amounts due as of the Closing pursuant to the
Blocker Indebtedness or the Aggregate Cash Purchase Price set forth in the
Adjusted Purchase Price Schedule, the Sellers Representative shall notify
Parent of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within forty-five (45) days after its
receipt of the Adjusted Purchase Price Schedule. In the event that the
Sellers Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within
such forty-five (45) day period, the Sellers Representative on behalf of all
Represented Holders shall be deemed to have accepted the Adjusted Purchase
Price Schedule and the calculation of the Interim EBITDA Amount, the Closing
Date Indebtedness, the amount of Transaction Expenses, all amounts due as of
the Closing pursuant to the Blocker Indebtedness, and the Aggregate Cash
Purchase Price, each of which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely
provided as set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 2.16(b)_, Parent
and the Sellers Representative shall use reasonable best efforts for a period
of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations of the Interim
EBITDA Amount, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the amount of Transaction
Expenses, any amounts due as of the Closing pursuant to the Blocker
Indebtedness, or the Aggregate Cash Purchase Price. If, at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Ernst and Young LLP
(or such other independent accounting or financial consulting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Parent and the
Sellers Representative) (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") shall resolve any
remaining disagreements. The parties shall instruct the Independent Accountant
to only consider those items and amounts from the notice of disagreement as to
which Parent and Sellers Representative have not resolved their disagreement.
Each of Parent and the Sellers Representative shall promptly provide their
assertions regarding the Interim EBITDA Amount, the Closing Date Indebtedness,
the amount of Transaction Expenses, all amounts due as of the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing pursuant to the Blocker Indebtedness and the Aggregate Cash Purchase
Price in writing to the Independent Accountant and to each other. The
Independent Accountant shall be instructed to render its determination with
respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably practicable (which the
parties hereto agree (i) shall not be later than thirty (30) days following
the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Independent Accountant,
(ii) shall be set forth in a written report setting forth in reasonable detail
the Independent Accountants determination of each of the disputed items and
the basis for such determination and (iii) shall be in the range of the
dispute between the Interim EBITDA Amount, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the
amount of Transaction Expenses, the amounts due as of the Closing pursuant to
the Blocker Indebtedness or the Aggregate Cash Purchase Price, as applicable,
set forth in the Adjusted Purchase Price Schedule and the amount disputed by
the Sellers Representative within the time period set forth in the first
sentence of this _Section 2.16(b)_). The Independent Accountant shall base
its determination solely on (x) the written submissions of the parties and
shall not conduct an independent investigation and (y) the extent, if any, to
which the Interim EBITDA Amount, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the amount of
Transaction Expenses, any amounts due as of the Closing pursuant to the
Blocker Indebtedness or the Aggregate Cash Purchase Price requires adjustment
(only with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Independent
Accountant) in order to be determined in accordance with this Agreement. The
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The last date on which the Interim EBITDA Amount, the
Closing Date Indebtedness, the amount of Transaction Expenses, all amounts due
as of the Closing pursuant to the Blocker Indebtedness and the Aggregate Cash
Purchase Price are all finally determined in accordance with this _Section
2.16(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_." The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountant relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Independent Accountant hereunder shall be allocated by the
Independent Accountant between the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Represented Holders), on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on
the aggregate percentage that the portions of the contested amounts not
awarded to each party bear to the aggregate amounts contested by such party,
and each party shall bear its own other expenses in connection therewith,
including its attorneys and accountants fees.

 



 

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then promptly (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days) following the Determination Date, (i)
Parent and the Sellers Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint
written instructions executed by a duly authorized representative of each of
Parent and the Sellers Representative directing the Escrow Agent to pay the
Adjustment Escrow Funds to the Payments Administrator, and (ii) Parent shall
pay an amount in cash equal to the Adjustment Amount to the Payments
Administrator by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in each case to
be received by the Payments Administrator on behalf of the Represented Holders
for further distribution to such holders in a manner consistent with _Section
2.06_ and _Section 2.07_.

 



 

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such
negative number, the " _Deficit Amount_ ") then promptly, (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) following the Determination Date, Parent and
the Sellers Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions executed by a duly authorized representative of each of Parent
and the Sellers Representative directing the Escrow Agent to pay:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) first, to Parent, an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (1) the Deficit
Amount and (2) the Adjustment Escrow Funds; and

 



 

(ii) then, if any of the Adjustment Escrow Funds remain after payment in full
to Parent pursuant to _clause (i)_ , to the Payments Administrator on behalf
of the Represented Holders, the Adjustment Escrow Funds for further
distribution to such holders in a manner consistent with _Section 2.06_ and
_Section 2.07_.

 



 

(e) The Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to, cause Management LLC to pay or cause to be paid to each holder of
Management Class C Units (whether or not vested) cash in the aggregate amount
to which such holder is entitled, as a result of any payments made to the
Represented Holders in connection with this _Section 2.16_, in respect of
Management Class C Units pursuant to the terms of the Management LLC
Agreement, if any (it being understood that, for such purposes, all Management
Class C Units shall be deemed to be vested). Promptly following the payment of
all amounts contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, take all steps
necessary to cancel the Management Class C Units and dissolve Management LLC.

 



 

(f) Any payment pursuant to this _Section 2.16_ shall be treated by the
parties for income Tax purposes as, and deemed to be, an adjustment of the
Aggregate Cash Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

THE BLOCKER_**

 



 

Except as disclosed in the Schedules (it being understood that the disclosure

creditors rights or by principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

(b) The sole member of the Blocker has, in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the Blocker and applicable Laws, duly adopted resolutions

(a) Assuming the truth and accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 5.07(a)_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party by the Blocker do not, and the

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
to which it is a party by the Blocker do not, and the performance by the
Blocker of this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements and the consummation

and the Closing Date, as follows:

 



 

Section 4.01 _Organization and Qualification_.

all requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as it is
currently being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign limited liability company in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties or assets makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing is not and would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is a duly organized and validly
existing corporation, partnership or limited liability company in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has in
all material respects all requisite corporate, partnership or limited
liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to conduct its business as it is currently being conducted and
(iii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation, partnership or limited liability company in all material respects
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing and operation of its properties or assets makes such qualification
necessary.

 



 

(c) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
Organizational Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company has, in accordance with the
Organizational Documents of the Company and applicable Laws, duly adopted
resolutions approving this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the

Section 5.08 _Available Funds_.

 



 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a
true and complete copy of an executed commitment letter (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto,

redacted with respect to the fee amounts and economic terms contained therein
that could not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount or
availability of the debt financing contemplated by such Debt Commitment
Letter, and the amount of original issue discount that may be imposed in the
event of an issuance of Senior Notes) from the Financing Sources, dated as of
the date hereof, pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed to
provide debt financing to Parent in an aggregate amount set forth therein and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_
"). Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as of the date hereof, the funds
provided by the Debt Financing, together with other funds available to Parent,
will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2 to pay the Aggregate Cash Purchase Price payable pursuant to this Agreement
and the other amounts payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.15_ and to pay
all fees and expenses associated therewith for which any of them is
responsible. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to its knowledge, each of the
other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to its knowledge, each
of the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general application affecting
enforcement of creditors rights or by principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), and is in
full force and effect. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn or
terminated or amended or modified in any respect (except for amendments or
modifications to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities, or otherwise so long as the terms
would not (A) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (B) delay the
Closing or (C) reduce the proceeds available thereunder). There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the Debt
Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and there
are no, and there are not contemplated to be any, agreements, side letters or
arrangements relating to the Debt Financing that could impair the availability
of any of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in or
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that (i) it or any other party thereto will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ii) any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or
(iii) the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date
(except to the extent Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent incurs the Senior
Notes on or prior to the Closing Date). Parent has fully paid (or caused to be
fully paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt
Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by
or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing or the issuance of
the Senior Notes) be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent, Merger
Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 hereunder.

 



 

Section 5.09 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents, Merger Sub 1s and Merger Sub 2s obligation to consummate the

respects of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ of this Agreement and (c) any estimates, projections or
forecasts of the Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, and such estimates, projections, forecasts and assumptions are
accurate, immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Debt Financing, and taking into account the
timing of and amount of cash expected to be received by it and the timing of
and amount of cash expected to be payable in respect of its Indebtedness,
Parent, the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving Company, as applicable, will be
able to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice as they become due (taking into account such Persons expected
contribution in respect of contingent liabilities constituting guarantees of
Indebtedness), will own property having a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities and such persons expected contribution
in respect of contingent liabilities constituting guarantees of Indebtedness)
and will not have, or have access to, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2_. Each of Merger Sub 1 and Merger
Sub 2 has not (a) engaged in any business activities or conducted any
operations other than entering into this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party or (b) incurred any liabilities (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent, known or unknown or otherwise) other than (i)
in connection with its formation, (ii) liabilities for Taxes and (iii) its
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party. All of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests
of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 are owned beneficially and of record by

Closing and the public announcement of the Mergers, the Sellers

Section 6.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after such time (including in respect of any matters arising in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Blocker, the Company or its Subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") as provided in their
respective Organizational Documents or in any agreement between the Blocker,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a DandO Indemnified Person shall
survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period
of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in such Persons
Organizational Documents to contain provisions that are less favorable with
respect to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any
DandO Indemnified Person with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after such
time (including in respect of any matters arising in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby), unless and only to
the extent required by applicable Law, it being the intent of the parties that
all such DandO Indemnified Persons shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law and that no change, modification or amendment of
such documents or arrangements may be made that will adversely affect any such
Persons right thereto without the prior written consent of that Person.

 



 

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 6.10_ and
not in limitation thereof, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and exculpate
and release from any liability to Parent, the Surviving Blocker or the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) the DandO Indemnified Persons
against all DandO Expenses (as defined below) and all losses, claims, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (" _D andO Losses_")
in respect of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, inquiry,
suit, proceeding, arbitration or judgment, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, based on, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer,
employee or other fiduciary of the Blocker, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any other Person arising out of or relating to acts or
omissions occurring or existing (or alleged to have occurred or existed) at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in respect of acts or omissions in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby)
(a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii) advance, to such DandO Indemnified
Persons all DandO Expenses (as defined below) incurred in connection with any
DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying
Party is

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise entitled to assume the defense of such claim and has assumed such
defense) promptly after receipt of statements therefor; provided, that the DandO
Indemnified Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent it is ultimately and finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification. Advance payment of DandO Expenses in
connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claims shall continue until such DandO
Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other
rulings in connection with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim become final and
nonappealable and are fully and finally satisfied. For the purposes of this
_Section 6.10_, " _D andO Expenses_" shall include attorneys fees, expert
fees, arbitrator and mediator fees, and all other costs, charges and expenses
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or otherwise participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
defend, to be a witness in or participate in, any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but
shall exclude losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts
paid in settlement (which items are included in the definition of DandO Losses).

 



 

(c) The Blocker and/or the Company may, prior to and effective as of the
Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for, at Parents sole cost and expense
(but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.10(c)_), " _tail_ "
insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
ratings as the Blockers or the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to officers and directors liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who
are covered by the existing DandO Insurance of the Blocker, the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
(including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) as favorable as
the existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters arising out of or relating
to acts or omissions occurring or existing (or alleged to have occurred or
existed) at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Blocker and the Surviving
Company to maintain such DandO Insurance in full force and effect for its full
term. If either of the Blocker or the Company for any reason fails to obtain
such " _tail_ " insurance policies prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving Company to, continue to
maintain in effect the Blockers and the Companys existing DandO Insurance, at
Parents sole cost and expense, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, for the persons who are covered by the Blockers
or the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions
and levels of coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and
exclusions) not less favorable than provided in the Blockers or the Companys
existing DandO Insurance, or, if such insurance is unavailable, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving Company to, purchase DandO
Insurance for such six (6) year period from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Blockers or the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to the Blockers or the Companys existing DandO Insurance
with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage (including as
coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) not less favorable than
provided in the Blockers or the Companys existing DandO Insurance. If any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim is asserted or made within any such six (6) year period,
Parent shall cause coverage under any such DandO Insurance described in this
_Section 6.10(c)_ to be continued beyond such six (6) year period in respect
of such claim until the final disposition of such DandO Indemnifiable Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent, the Surviving Blocker
or the Surviving Company be required to expend for such policies an

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate premium amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Blocker or the Company, as applicable,
for such DandO Insurance; _provided_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such
coverage exceed such amount, Parent, the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, shall obtain a policy with similar coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount for such six (6) year period
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Blockers or the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to the
Blockers or the Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage (including as coverage relates to
deductibles and exclusions) not materially less favorable than provided in the
Blockers or the Companys existing policies.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Blocker or the Surviving Company
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any
Person (including by liquidation, dissolution or assignment for the benefit of
creditors or similar action), then, and in each such case, Parent, the
Surviving Blocker or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or
transferees assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_ (by
operation of law or expressly, as the case may be).

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person referred to in
_Section 6.10(a)_ and, in each case, his or her heirs and his or her
executors, administrators and personal representatives, each of whom is an
intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.10_, and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights, including rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall survive the
consummation of the Mergers.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, provide all individuals, other than individuals who are subject to
collective bargaining agreements, who are employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with
compensation, benefits, and perquisites that, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, including annual base salary or wages, commission rate, and
annual incentive opportunity, but excluding equity incentive opportunity or
defined benefit pension benefits. With respect to individuals employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date who are subject to a
collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of such employees
employment shall continue to be provided in accordance with the terms of the
applicable collective bargaining agreement and any subsequent negotiations
between Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and the collective bargaining
representative.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, honor, pay, perform and satisfy any and all liabilities,
obligations and

 



      
 

 



 

responsibilities to, or in respect of, each employee and officer of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and each former employee and officer of Company
and its Subsidiaries, as of the Closing arising under the terms of, or in
connection with, any Plan in accordance with the terms thereof, including any
reserved right to amend or terminate any Plan.

 



 

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and entitlement to
benefits, including the determination of the level of vacation and severance
pay benefits under the benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements
and arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in which employees are eligible to participate following the
Closing (the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent and the Surviving Company shall
credit each employee with his or her years of service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such employee
was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under
any similar Plan, except for benefit accrual service under retirement plans
and except where such crediting would result in duplication of benefits. The
Parent Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of pre-
existing conditions to the extent such conditions were waived or satisfied
under similar Plans immediately prior to the Closing and shall credit such
Continuing Employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior
to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
in the applicable plan year to which such deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses relate.

 



 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this
_Section 6.11_ are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including any
employee, former employee or any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any
Plan or Parent Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Company. Nothing contained in this
_Section 6.11_ is intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or
adoption of any plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Company (including
any Plan). Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ shall interfere with
Parents, the Surviving Companys or any of the Surviving Companys
Subsidiaries right to amend, modify or terminate any Plan or to terminate the
employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any reason
so long as Parent, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Company Subsidiaries
are in compliance with any obligations they may have under _Section 6.11(a)_
or _Section 6.11(b)_.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, provide to Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, in each case at Parents

Companys independent auditors) and such other financial information
reasonably requested by Parent that would be reasonably necessary for Parents
Financing Sources to receive customary accountants comfort letters;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or

communication or meeting, consider in good faith the views of the Sellers
Representative with respect thereto, and provide the Sellers Representative
with the opportunity to participate in any such communication or meeting,
(iii) not pledge or subject to any Lien any interest in either of the ROI
Receivable or the CMS Receivable, (iv) not transfer or convey any interest in
either of the ROI Receivable or the CMS Receivable except as required by
_Section 6.16(c)_, _provided_ that the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries

Parent or any other subsidiary of Parent, and (v) without limiting the
provisions in clauses (iii) and (iv) above, not take any action that would
reasonably be expected to materially compromise, cause a material reduction
in, materially delay or make materially more difficult the obtaining from CMS
of the CMS Receivable.

 



 

(b) Promptly, and in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days, following
the receipt of any payment in respect of the CMS Receivable by EIC, Parent
shall cause EIC to pay in cash to ROI Indebtedness owing by EIC to ROI (the "

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that it is
their intention that (x) the purchase price payable hereunder is not
reflective of the value of the CMS Receivable and (y) the arrangements in this
_Section 6.16_ are for the purpose of enabling the Represented Holders to
retain the economic benefit of the CMS Receivable.

 



 

(f) Any amounts not paid within the time periods set forth in _Section
6.16(c)_ or _Section 6.16(d)_ shall accrue interest at a rate of 15% per

timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, Parent shall file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to any such Transfer Taxes and
shall pay all such Transfer Taxes. The Sellers Representative will cooperate

extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant Governmental

Date as the last day of a taxable period of each of the Blocker, the Company,
and each of the Companys Subsidiaries.

 



 

(ii) Any Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company, the Surviving
Company or their Subsidiaries that are flow-through entities for Tax purposes

required otherwise by applicable Law. The Sellers Representative shall submit
each such Tax Return to Parent for its review not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (taking into account
any extension of time within which to file), and shall incorporate reasonable
comments thereon provided by Parent to the Sellers Representative no later
than ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking
into account any extension of time within which to file). Parent, the
Surviving Company and the Surviving Companys Subsidiaries that are flow-
through entities for Tax purposes shall cooperate with the Sellers
Representative in the filing of any such Tax Returns and shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this _Section 6.18_. For the avoidance of doubt, the

are flow-through entities for Tax purposes shall file any amended Tax Return
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
for the avoidance of doubt, it shall be unreasonable for the Sellers
Representative to withhold, condition, or delay its consent to the extent the
filing of any such amended Tax Return is required by applicable Law pursuant
to a final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any
other similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

 



 

(b) _Tax Contents and Cooperation_.

 



 

(i) Following the Closing Date, Parent, the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving
Company and their Subsidiaries that are flow-through entities for Tax

on the other hand (each, the " _Recipient_ ," and together, the " _Contest
Parties_ "), shall notify the other Contest Party within twenty (20) Business
Days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any Tax Contest with
respect to the Blocker, the Company, or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
which could reasonably be expected to affect such other Contest Partys
liability for Taxes. In addition to the foregoing, each Contest Party shall
promptly provide to the other Contest Party copies of all written notices and
other documents received from the applicable Governmental Authority (provided
that the Contest Party receiving such notice or other document may redact from
such copies information not reasonably related to or necessary for determining
the amount of Taxes, or nature of the audit, claim, dispute or controversy),
with respect to such Tax Contest for which the other Contest Party may have a
liability for Tax.

 



 

(ii) After the Closing Date, each of Parent, the Surviving Company, the
Surviving Blocker, and their Subsidiaries that are flow-through entities for
Tax purposes shall use reasonable efforts to assist the Departing Interest
Holders in preparing and filing any Tax Returns relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period (including the Tax Returns of their direct and
indirect owners) and shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate in preparing
for Tax Contests regarding any Tax Returns relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
and Pre-Closing Straddle Periods (which cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon request) the provision to the requesting party, at the
sole cost of the requesting party, of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to a Tax Contest, making employees available during normal
business hours on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to a Tax Contest).

 



 

(iii) After the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative shall cooperate with
Parent to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
preparing for any Tax Contest regarding any Tax Returns relating to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and Pre-Closing Straddle Periods.

 



 

(iv) In connection with such assistance, the Sellers Representative, Parent,
the Surviving Company, the Surviving Blocker and their Subsidiaries shall use

litigation brought by Parent or the Represented Holders against the Blocker,
the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company shall not settle, agree to any
undertakings or approve or otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in
connection with such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed to the
extent such settlement provides no relief other than the payment of monetary
damages). Without limiting in any way the parties obligations under _Section
6.01_ and _Section 6.02_, each of the parties shall cooperate in the
settlement of any litigation by third parties contemplated by this _Section
6.19_.

their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
Closing, from the holder of the Blocker Interest and each holder of Company
Units a certification of its non-foreign status conforming to the requirements
of Treasury Regulations section 1.1445-2(b)(2) and (b) furnish to Parent all
such certifications so obtained by the Blocker or the Company prior to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.12_ to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld
with respect to Persons who fail to provide such certification.

 



 

Section 6.21 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify and provide copies to the other of (a) any material written
notice from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (b) any written notice or other written communication from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers or the other

against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to such partys representations or warranties, as
the case may be, or that relate to the consummation of the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the parties shall keep
each other reasonably informed on a current basis with respect to the status
thereof); and (d) the occurrence of any event which would or would be
reasonably expected to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) result in the
failure of any condition to the Mergers set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 6.21_ shall not (A) affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any party hereunder or (B) update any section of the Schedules
or the Parent Schedules.

 



 

Section 6.22 _Termination of Affiliate Arrangements_. All agreements between
the Company or a Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand (other than (a) all outstanding employment
arrangements between the Company or a Subsidiary, on the one hand, and an
employee of the Company or such Subsidiary, on the other hand, and the Plans,
(b) transactions solely between the Company and one or more of its
Subsidiaries or between or among any Subsidiaries and (c) the agreements
listed on _Schedule 6.22(a)_ ), including the agreements listed on _Schedule
6.22(b)_ , shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and all obligations and
liabilities thereunder shall have been satisfied. All obligations (whether
present, future or contingent) under Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax
indemnity agreements relating to Tax matters between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Person that is not the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the day
before the Closing Date, such that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to make any payment to any Person that is not

rights pursuant to any such agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.23 _Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 Financing Cooperation._

 



 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such actions and to do, or cause
to be done, such things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain
the Debt Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter at or prior to Closing, shall enforce in all material
respects its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, shall not, until after
the Effective Time, effect or cause to be effected any voluntary or mandatory
termination, prepayment or reduction in the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing or the respective commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter, and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, or enter into any side
letter or other agreement permitting such amendment, modification or waiver,
of any provision or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Debt Financing) or (ii) impose new or additional
conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the
receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that, individually or in the
aggregate with other such amendments, modifications or waivers, would
reasonably be expected to (A) have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or (B)
delay or make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (C)
adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 to
enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto; it being understood and
agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this sentence,
Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 may reduce (through voluntary or
mandatory terminations or otherwise) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing in connection with any cash received by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2 from other sources (including by reason of a capital market or
other financing transaction) that is available to satisfy the obligations of
Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 under this Agreement, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Senior Notes issued by a subsidiary of Parent formed for
the purpose of issuing Senior Notes with the proceeds funded in escrow pending
consummation of the Mergers, subject to customary escrow terms, which shall
not subject the release of the proceeds of the Senior Notes from escrow to any
conditions that are not also a condition to the availability of the Debt
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter, except for customary escrow
release conditions such as the execution and delivery of relevant definitive
documents (or joinders thereto), delivery of officer certificates and legal
opinions and, only if the initial issuer of the Senior Notes is a "escrow
subsidiary" of Parent, consummation of any applicable "escrow" merger with and
into Parent or other assumption of the Senior Notes by Parent. Parent, Merger
Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
agents, co-agents, lenders, arrangers, joint bookrunners, managers or other
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the
aggregate with other such additions, would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, or materially delay or impair the availability of the financing under
the Debt Commitment Letter or have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent
shall apprise the Company of material developments relating to the Debt
Financing and shall give the Company notice of any material adverse change
with respect to such Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two () Business
Days as the same comes to the knowledge of Parent, if at any time prior to the
Closing Date (i) the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the commitments with
respect to the Debt Financing thereunder or any definitive financing

 



      
 

 



 

agreement, as applicable, shall expire or be terminated for any reason (to the
extent not concurrently replaced with commitments of other lenders and
excluding any such termination in connection with the issuance of Senior
Notes), (ii) for any reason, all or a portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable (except such unavailability related to the issuance of Senior
Notes) or (iii) any Financing Source or any other Person that is a party to
the Debt Commitment Letter breaches, defaults, terminates or repudiates any
provisions thereunder or threatens in writing to do any of the foregoing. If
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and subject to the conditions that are no less
favorable to Parent than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Mergers (together with other sources of
cash available to Parent) on the Closing Date (the " _Alternate Financing_ "
and any financing commitments with respect to the Alternate Financing, an "
_Alternate Financing Commitment Letter_ "). In the event any Alternate
Financing is obtained and an Alternate Commitment Letter is entered into in
accordance with this _Section 6.23_, (i) any reference in this Agreement to "
_Debt Financing_ " shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " (or defined
terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent not superseded by an Alternate Commitment Letter, at the
time in question and any Alternate Commitment Letter to the extent then in
effect. Parent shall have the right from time to time to substitute other debt
or equity financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same
and/or alternative financing sources, in each case, in a manner not less
beneficial, in terms of conditions to funding or aggregate funding amounts, as
compared with the Debt Commitment Letter). Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2 shall provide the Company with a copy of any Alternate Financing Commitment
Letters obtained by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 in connection with
any Alternate Financing as promptly as practicable following the execution
thereof (other than fees and other information customarily redacted from such
agreements). In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that the Parent is unable to issue debt securities in lieu of the Debt
Financing regardless of the reason therefor or then current market conditions,
such inability shall not excuse the Parent from its obligations hereunder to
effect the Closing in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, and Parent shall remain obligated to use its reasonable best efforts
to effectuate the funding of the bridge facility contemplated under the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions provided for therein no later
than the date the Closing is required to occur on hereunder.

 



 

Section 6.24 _Data Security Matters_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Closing and the date on which this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_, the Blocker and
the Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate with Parent to: use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop
and implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards that are in
compliance, and to otherwise comply, with the International Organization for
Standardizations ISO-IEC 27002 and other applicable industry standards for
information security and (ii) revise any privacy policies, notices or
statements as necessary to comply with Information Privacy and Security Laws.
All actions taken by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this
_Section 6.24_ shall be at Parents sole expense; _provided, however,_ that
all expenses shall be disclosed to Parent for approval in writing in advance;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Company and its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to take any action pursuant to this
_Section 6.24_ for which the Parent declines to pay any related expenses.

 



 

Section 6.25 _Termination of ISDA Contracts, Etc_. The Blocker and the
Company shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, as applicable,
to terminate, as of or prior to the Closing Date, the agreements set forth on
_Schedule 6.25_ such that none of the Blocker, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to make any payment or have any other
liability to any third party pursuant to any such agreements following the
Closing.

would not then be satisfied;

 



 

(f) by Parent, if, within 24 hours of the execution of this Agreement, the
irrevocable action by written consent of the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding Company Class A Units and Company Class B Units
(including TPG VI Envision, L.P. and Envision Rx Options Holdings Inc.) in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, which will constitute the Company Member
Consent, shall not have been delivered to Parent and the Company;

 



 

(g) by the Company, if the Marketing Period has ended and (i) all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ have been and
continue to be satisfied or waived if the Closing were to occur on the date of
such termination, other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied other than at the Closing, and the Blocker and the Company stand
ready, willing and able to satisfy the conditions that by their nature cannot
be satisfied other than at the Closing and to consummate the Closing through
the end of the three Business Day period following the date of such notice (as
evidenced by irrevocable written confirmation delivered by the Blocker and the
Company to Parent), (ii) the Blocker and the Company have irrevocably
confirmed by written notice to Parent of their intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.02(g)_ if Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2 fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the close of business on the third Business Day following the
date of such notice and (iii) Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 fails to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the close of
business on the third Business Day following the date of such notice, provided
that the conditions in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ remain satisfied
and the confirmation set forth in clause (i) hereof remains in full force and
effect at the close of business on such third Business Day, provided, further,
however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
8.02(g)_, in the event that the Marketing Period begins on or after September
8, 2015, the Blocker and the Company may confirm by irrevocable written notice
to Parent at any time during the Marketing Period that they (x) will be ready,
willing and able to satisfy all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_
and _Section 7.02_ on September 23, 2015 and (y) intend to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.02(g)_ if the Marketing Period has
ended and Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 fails to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the close of business on
September 23, 2015, in which case the Blocker and the Company shall be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.02(g)_ if
(1) the Marketing Period has ended, (2) Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2
fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
close of business on September 23, 2015 and (3) the conditions in _Section
7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ are satisfied and the confirmation set forth in this
proviso remains in full force and effect at the close of business on September
23, 2015.

 



      
 

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of clause _(b)_
, _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ or _(g)_ of this _Section 8.02_ shall give
written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with
_Section 9.01_ specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effected.

 



 

Section 8.03 _Effect of Termination, Etc._

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.02_, (i) this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no
effect and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, except
this _Section 8.03_, _Section 6.09_ (Public Statements), _Section 6.12(e)_
(Financial Cooperation), relevant defined terms in _Article I_, _Article IX_
(other than _Section 9.16_ (Waiver of Conflicts)) and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement and remain valid and
binding obligations of each of the parties, and (ii) subject to the terms and
conditions of the surviving provisions of this Agreement, there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the
Blocker or the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.02_ shall not
release any party hereto from any liability (x) pursuant to the sections
specified in this _Section 8.03_ that survive such termination, or (y) for
any Intentional Breach by a party of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements that occurred prior to such termination, except as
otherwise provided in _Sections 8.03(b)_ or _Section 8.03(c)_.

 



 

(b) If the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.02(g)_ , then the Company may elect, by delivery of a written notice to
Parent within five (5) Business Days after such termination, (i) that Parent
pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to $200,000,000 (the " _Financing
Reverse Termination Fee_ "), in which case Parent shall make such payment as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days) after receipt of such notice, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in writing by the Company in such notice, and
upon receipt thereof the Company shall be deemed, including on behalf of the
Blocker and the holders of equity interests in the Blocker and the Company, to
have irrevocably waived the right under this Agreement to claim that Parent,
Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 has committed an Intentional Breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or,
alternatively, (ii) that Parent not pay to the Company such Financing Reverse
Termination Fee, in which case the Company shall be deemed, including on
behalf of the Blocker and the holders of equity interests in the Blocker and
the Company, to have irrevocably waived such Financing Reverse Termination
Fee. In the event that the Company makes neither election within such five
(5) Business Day period described in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall be deemed to have made the election in clause (ii). In no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Financing Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one occasion and in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Financing Reverse Termination Fee if the Regulatory Reverse Termination Fee
has already been paid.

 



 

(c) In the event that (a) this Agreement has been validly terminated by either
the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)_, _Section 8.02(c)_ or,
as a result of a material breach under _Section 6.06_, _Section 8.02(e)_,
and (b) the condition set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_, _Section 7.01(c)_ or,
in the case of any Restraint imposed or any action or proceeding

 



      
 

 



 

brought by any Governmental Authority in respect of or under any Antitrust Law
or Health Regulatory Law, _Section 7.01(a)_ has not been satisfied as of the
date of such termination but all conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ (other than _Section 7.01(a)_, _Section 7.01(b)_
and _Section 7.01(c)_) shall otherwise have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but which
conditions would have been satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
termination), then the Company may elect, by delivery of a written notice to
Parent within five (5) Business Days after such termination, (i) that Parent
pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to $60,000,000 (the " _Regulatory
Reverse Termination Fee_ "), in which case Parent shall make such payment as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days) after receipt of such notice, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in writing by the Company in such notice, and
upon receipt thereof the Company shall be deemed, including on behalf of the
Blocker and the holders of equity interests in the Blocker and the Company, to
have irrevocably waived the right under this Agreement to claim that Parent,
Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 has committed an Intentional Breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or,
alternatively, (ii) that Parent not pay to the Company such Regulatory Reverse
Termination Fee, in which case the Company shall be deemed, including on
behalf of the Blocker and the holders of equity interests in the Blocker and
the Company, to have irrevocably waived such Regulatory Reverse Termination
Fee. In the event that the Company makes neither election within such five (5)
Business Day period described in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall be deemed to have made the election in clause (ii). In no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Regulatory Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one occasion or be required to pay both the Regulatory Reverse
Termination Fee and the Financing Reverse Termination Fee.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without the Financing Reverse Termination Fee or the
Regulatory Reverse Termination Fee and the other provisions of this _Section
8.03_, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement; and that the
payment of the Financing Reverse Termination Fee or the Regulatory Reverse
Termination Fee, in circumstances in which it is paid, is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Blocker and the Company and their respective Affiliates under the
circumstances for losses or damages (other than any losses or damages incurred
as a result of an Intentional Breach by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2)
suffered or incurred by the Blocker and the Company and their respective
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that any action, suit or proceeding is commenced or instituted by the Company
in respect of the Financing Reverse Termination Fee or a claim for specific
performance of Parents obligations as contemplated by _Section 9.13_, during
the pendency of such proceeding and, if a court of competent jurisdiction has
ordered Parent to pay the Financing Reverse Termination Fee and/or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, until two (2)
Business Days following such order, Parent may at any time notify the Company
in writing that it will consummate the Closing within five (5) Business Days
following such notice, in which case the

 



      
 

 



 

parties shall consummate the Closing and neither the Blocker nor the Company
shall be permitted or entitled to enforce such order during such five (5)
Business Day period (and, if the Closing is not consummated, the Company shall
be entitled to continue to pursue such action or to enforce such order, as
applicable, following such five (5) Business Day period). For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties acknowledge that neither the Blocker nor the Company shall
seek to enforce any such order for payment of the Financing Reverse
Termination Fee during the two (2) Business Day period following such order or
in the event the Closing is consummated.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the limited rights to specific performance of the Company to the extent set
forth in _Section 9.13_ and except in the case of Intentional Breach, the
Companys right to receive payment of the Financing Reverse Termination Fee or
the Regulatory Reverse Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to (and to the
extent set forth in) this _Section 8.03_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Blocker, the Company and their respective Affiliates against
Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 and their respective former, current, or
future direct or indirect general or limited partners, equityholders,
stockholders, controlling persons, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, subsidiaries, portfolio companies, attorneys and other
representatives, the Financing Sources, and their respective successors,
assignees and agents, and any former, current, or future direct or indirect
general or limited partners, equityholders, stockholders, controlling persons,
managers, members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, subsidiaries,
portfolio companies, attorneys and other representatives of any of the
foregoing, and their respective successors, assignees and agents (each, a "
_Parent Related Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ")
for any breach, loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the
Closing to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise. Under no circumstances shall the Blocker, the Company, their
respective members or any of their respective Affiliates be permitted or
entitled to pursue or receive both a grant of specific performance and any
money damages, including all or any portion of the Financing Reverse
Termination Fee or the Regulatory Reverse Termination Fee. If the Company
elects to receive the Financing Reverse Termination Fee or Regulatory Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to _Sections 8.03(b)_ or _Section_ 8.03(c), upon
termination of this Agreement and payment of the Financing Reverse Termination
Fee or Regulatory Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Sections 8.03(b)_ or
_Section_ 8.03(c), none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability to the Blocker, the Company or their respective members or any of
their respective Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Debt Financing or in respect of any other document or theory of law or
equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, based on contract,
tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable
Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or
another Person or otherwise.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Blocker,
the Company (and their respective stockholders, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents, excluding, in the
event the Mergers are consummated, Parent or any Subsidiary) hereby waive any
and all rights and claims against any Financing Source and any of their
Affiliates, and any of such entities or Affiliates respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, directors, officers,

 



      
 

 



 

employees, representatives or agents related to, arising out of or in
connection with the Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity,
in contract, tort or otherwise.

Section 9.02 _Amendment/Waiver, Etc._ Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if, such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, modification or supplement by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2,
the Blocker and the Company, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 8.03(f)_
(Effect of Termination), _Section 8.03(g)_ (Waiver of Rights Against
Financing Sources), this _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.07_ (Parties in
Interest), _Section 9.09_ (Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial)
and _Section 9.15_ (Non-Recourse), shall not be amended, modified,
supplemented or waived, and no consent shall be given thereunder, in each case
in any manner that is adverse to the interests of the Financing Sources
without their prior written consent. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof

 



      
 

 



 

nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 



 

Section 9.03 _Assignment_. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto and any attempt to assign this Agreement without
such consent shall be void and of no effect, except that each of Parent,
Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all
its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to one or more
Subsidiaries of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent, Merger
Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 of any of their obligations hereunder and no such
assignment shall be made if it would be reasonably expected to materially
delay or impair the receipt of any material Consent or the expiration of the
waiting period under the HSR Act (or any extension thereof) or otherwise delay
or impair the consummation of the Closing.

 



 

Section 9.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules,
Parent Schedules and Exhibits hereto), and the Ancillary Agreements together
with the Confidentiality Agreement contains the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such
matters.

 



 

Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is deemed, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



 

Section 9.06 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party under
this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an
Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by such party.

 



 

Section 9.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, other than the provisions of (a)
_Section 2.02_, _Section 2.06_, _Section 2.07_, _Section 2.10_, _Section
2.11_, _Section 2.13_, _Section 2.15_ and _Section 2.16_, to the extent
they apply to the Represented Holders, which holders shall be express third-
party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such sections, (b)
_Section 6.07(b)_ and _Section 6.17_, to the extent they apply to the
Represented Holders and their respective Affiliates, which Represented Holders
and Affiliates shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely on, such sections, (c) _Section 6.10_, to the extent it
applies to DandO Indemnified Persons (including the successors, assigns, heirs,
executors, administrators and personal representatives of such DandO Indemnified
Persons), which DandO Indemnified Persons shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such section, (d)
_Section 10.15_, to the extent it applies to the

 



      
 

 



 

Persons referred to therein, which Persons shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such section and (e)
_Section 9.16_, to the extent it applies to Cleary Gottlieb, which shall be
an express third-party beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such
section, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than
Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Blocker, the Company, its Subsidiaries
or their successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement, except for the right of the Blocker and the Company,
on behalf of the holders of equity interests in the Blocker or the Company, as
applicable, to pursue claims for damages in the event of an Intentional Breach
of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, and which right
may, for the avoidance of doubt, only be enforced prior to the Closing by the
Blocker and the Company, as applicable, on behalf of such holders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources are express third party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on and enforce, _Section
8.03(f)_ (Effect of Termination), _Section 8.03(g)_ (Waiver of Rights Against
Financing Sources), this _Section 9.07_, _Section 9.02_ (Amendment; Waiver,
Etc.); _Section 9.09_ (Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial) and
_Section 9.15_ (Non-Recourse).

 



 

Section 9.08 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such expenses; provided, that any filing fees arising in connection with any
Antitrust Law or any Health Regulatory Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be borne by Parent and Parent shall pay all fees,
expenses or other payments due to the Escrow Agent, Payments Administrator and
Exchange Agent (with the Represented Holders bearing 50% of such fees,
expenses or other payments due to the Escrow Agent, Payments Administrator or
Exchange Agent through the definition of Transaction Expenses).

 



 

Section 9.09 _Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and any claim, suit, action or proceeding in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or the legal relationship of the parties hereto or thereto (whether at law or
in equity, and whether in contract or in tort or otherwise), shall be governed
by and enforced pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware, its rules of
conflict of laws notwithstanding. Except as contemplated by _Section 2.16_,
each party hereby irrevocably agrees and consents to be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or
any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and any appellate court
therefrom (collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ ") in any suit, action or
proceeding described in the immediately preceding sentence of this _Section
9.09(a)_. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all
process in any such suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of such process
in the manner provided in _Section 9.01_. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit, claim or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether at law or in equity, and whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise) in the Chosen Courts and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Chosen Court that any such action, suit, claim or proceeding brought in any
Chosen Court has been brought in

 



      
 

 



 

an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that it will
not bring or support, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support, any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in any forum other than the Chosen Courts, and
that the provisions of _Section 9.09(b)_ relating to the waiver of jury trial
shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim. The parties further agree that any final and nonappealable
judgment against any of them in any action, suit or proceeding described in
the first sentence of this _Section 9.09(a)_ shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the U.S. by suit on
judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact
and amount of such judgment. Without in any way limiting any waiver or
limitation of the Financing Sources liability or any other provision relating
to the Financing Sources and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of the Blocker, Company and Sellers Representative agrees that it will
not bring or support or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources and their respective current, former
or future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees, agents or other
representatives in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and the appellate courts thereof) and each party hereto further agrees that
the adjudication of any such action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
shall be governed by and in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, subsection or clause are

unless otherwise specified.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party hereto and, except
as otherwise set forth herein, at the expense of the party so requesting, each
other party shall execute and deliver to such requesting party such documents
and take such other action as such requesting party may reasonably request in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) The parties understand and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its terms and further agree that, although monetary damages
may be available for the breach of such covenants and undertakings, monetary
damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, except as
otherwise set forth in this _Section 9.13_, each party hereto agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Blocker or the Company, on the one hand, or Parent,
Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, on the other hand, of any provision of this
Agreement, the Blocker or the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub
1 or Merger Sub 2, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide,
furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any such order or injunction, and each party hereby
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the provision, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or other security. In the event that any action,
claim, suit or proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereto
hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including Section
5.08(b), it is acknowledged and agreed that the Blocker and the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance of Parents, Merger Sub 1s and Merger Sub
2s obligations to consummate the Mergers only in the event that each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the Marketing Period has ended
and all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied), (ii) Parent, Merger Sub 1 and
Merger Sub 2 fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required
to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.02_, (iii) the Debt Financing has
been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing assuming satisfaction by
Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 of the conditions precedent thereto
under their respective control, and (iv) the Company has confirmed in an
irrevocable written notice delivered to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then it would take such actions that
are within its control (which shall for this purpose include causing the
Blocker to take actions) to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of
doubt, (x) in no event shall the Blocker and the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents, Merger Sub 1s and Merger
Sub 2s obligations to consummate the Mergers if the Debt Financing has not
been funded or will not be funded at the Closing, and (y) while the Blocker
and the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to
the extent expressly permitted by this _Section 9.13_ and the payment of the
Financing Reverse Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 8.03(b)_), under no circumstances shall the Blocker and the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance to
cause the Closing to occur in accordance with this _Section 9.13_ and payment
of the Financing Reverse Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged
and agreed that (i) the Company shall be entitled to specific performance or
other equitable remedies to cause Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 to
enforce the obligation of the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) in the event
that any Financing Source initiates any litigation against Parent, Merger Sub
1 or Merger Sub 2 with respect to the Debt Financing, or advises Parent,
Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 that it intends not to provide the Debt Financing
in violation of the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance or other equitable remedies
to require Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 to take enforcement action,
including seeking specific performance, to cause the Financing Sources to
provide such Debt Financing.

 



 

(d) No party shall have any right to set-off any amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement against any other amounts payable by the recipient thereof or
any other Person pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) " _knowledge_ "
of the Blocker or the Company means the actual knowledge of the persons listed
on _Schedule 9.14(a)_ and (b) " _knowledge_ " of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2 means the actual knowledge of the persons listed on _Parent
Schedule 9.14(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.15 _Non-Recourse_. Except for the Sellers Representatives rights
to indemnity from the Represented Holders under Section 9.20, this Agreement
may only be enforced against the named parties hereto (subject to the terms,
conditions and other limitations set forth herein). Following the Closing, and
in each case except for the Sellers Representatives rights to indemnity from
the Represented Holders under _Section 9.20_, (a) all claims or causes of
action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may be made only
against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto and not,
for the avoidance of doubt, against the Financing Sources and (b) except as
expressly provided hereunder, no Financing Source and no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto
(including any person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a
party hereto) shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this
Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action that may arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ this clause (a) and (b) shall not
impair, limit or affect any claims or causes of actions related to agreements
entered into with Financing Sources by the parties thereto.

 



 

Section 9.16 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Cleary Gottlieb has acted
as legal counsel to the Blocker, the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the
direct and indirect holders of the Blocker Interest, of Company Units, of RSUs
and of Phantom Units and certain of their respective Affiliates prior to the
date hereof, and that Cleary Gottlieb intends to act as legal counsel to
certain of the direct and indirect holders of the Blocker Interest, of Company
Units, of RSUs and of Phantom Units and their respective Affiliates (which
will no longer include the Blocker, the Company or its Subsidiaries) after the
Closing, each of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Blocker and the
Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, the
Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with Cleary Gottlieb representing the
Sellers Representative or any direct or indirect holders of the Blocker
Interest, of Company Units, of RSUs or of Phantom Units or their Affiliates
after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2, the Blocker, the Company, the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving
Company and its Affiliates or the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between
direct and indirect holders of the Blocker Interest, of Company Units, of RSUs
or of Phantom Units, the Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Cleary Gottlieb, on the other
hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the direct and indirect holders of the
Blocker Interest, of Company Units, of RSUs and of Phantom Units and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Blocker, the Company, the Surviving
Blocker, the Surviving Company or their respective Affiliates). Accordingly,
the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates
shall not have access to any such communications or to the files of Cleary
Gottlieb relating to such engagement from and after the Effective Time.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective
Time, (i) the direct and indirect holders of the Blocker Interest, of Company
Units, of RSUs and of Phantom Units and their respective Affiliates (and not
the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates)
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to
such engagement, and none of the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company or
its Affiliates shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
Cleary

 



      
 

 



 

Gottlieb in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only
the direct and indirect holders of the Blocker Interest, of Company Units, of
RSUs and of Phantom Units and their respective Affiliates (and not the
Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates)
shall hold such property rights and (iii) Cleary Gottlieb shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to the Surviving Blocker, the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates
by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Cleary Gottlieb and the
Blocker, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise. This
_Section 9.16_ will be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 9.16_ may
be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of Cleary
Gottlieb.

 



 

Section 9.17 _DISCLAIMER_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED
HEREIN: (A) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BLOCKER AND THE COMPANY
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE III_ AND _ARTICLE IV_, RESPECTIVELY, ARE AND
SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE
WITH RESPECT TO THE BLOCKER, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND (B) EXCEPT
FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (A) ABOVE, NONE
OF THE BLOCKER, THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS MADE OR
IS MAKING ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, STATUTORY OR
OTHERWISE, OF ANY NATURE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED
HEREIN: (I) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN _ARTICLE V_ ARE AND SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE

THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND (II) EXCEPT FOR
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (I) ABOVE, NEITHER
PARENT NOR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS MADE OR IS MAKING ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, OF ANY NATURE.

 



 

Section 9.18 _No Rescission_. No party to this Agreement shall be entitled to
rescind the transactions contemplated hereby by virtue of any failure of any
partys representations and warranties herein to have been true or any failure
by any party hereto to perform its obligations hereunder, and each party
agrees that it will not seek to rescind the transactions contemplated hereby
in connection with any Litigation concerning this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.19 _Interpretation_. The words " _hereof_ ", " _herein_ ", "
_hereto_ ", " _hereunder_ " and " _hereinafter_ " and words of similar import,
when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither the specification of
any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule or Parent
Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or

shall use the fact of setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any
such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule or

the specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule or Parent Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter, or
other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any
specific item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in

business for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.20 _Sellers  Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Blocker
Interest or any Company Units, RSUs, Phantom Units or Management Class C Units
(each a " _Represented Holder_ ") shall be deemed to have irrevocably
constituted, appointed, authorized, directed and empowered, effective as of
the Closing (and without regard to whether such holder has delivered a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal), Shareholder Representative Services LLC as
the " _Sellers  Representative_", to act as sole and exclusive agent,
attorney-in-fact and representative of the Represented Holders, with full
power of substitution, with respect to all matters under this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto, including giving and receiving notices
hereunder, entering into any amendment or modification hereof, engaging
special counsel, accountants or other advisors or incurring such other
expenses on behalf of the

 



      
 

 



 

Represented Holders, holding back from disbursement to any Represented Holder
any such funds to the extent it reasonably determines may be necessary or
required under the terms and conditions of this Agreement or applicable Law,
negotiating, settling, compromising or otherwise resolving any dispute
hereunder (including any disputes relating to the Adjustment Amount) or doing
any and all things and taking any and all actions, in each case that the
Sellers Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider
necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other documents or
instruments entered into in connection herewith.

 



 

(b) Neither the Sellers Representative nor any of its officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents or representatives shall incur any responsibility
or liability whatsoever to any Represented Holder by reason of any error in
judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in
connection with this Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or
document, except to the extent any act or failure to act constitutes fraud or
willful misconduct. The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to rely on
the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue. The Sellers Representative shall not be
required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance
of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. The
Represented Holders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the Sellers
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ that, in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
fraud or willful misconduct of the Sellers Representative, the Sellers
Representative will reimburse the Represented Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such fraud or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Sellers Representative by the
Represented Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Sellers Representative from (i) the funds in the Sellers Representative
Expense Fund and (ii) the amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Funds at such time
as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Represented
Holders; _provided_ that, while this section allows the Sellers
Representative to be paid from the Sellers Representative Expense Fund and
the Adjustment Escrow Funds, this does not relieve the Represented Holders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Sellers Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event will the Sellers
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Represented Holders or otherwise. The Sellers Representative may consult with
counsel of its own choice and will have full and complete authorization and
protection for any action taken and suffered by it in good faith and in
accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The indemnity obligations of this
_Section 9.20_ shall survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Sellers Representative or any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.02_.

 



 

(c) The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to pay and reimburse itself
from the Sellers Representative Expense Fund for any third-party, out-of-
pocket expenses,

 



      
 

 



 

charges or liabilities that the Sellers Representative incurs, or may incur,
in the exercise of it rights, or performance of its duties, under this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 shall have the right to rely
upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers Representative
hereunder or in connection with this Agreement. All decisions, actions,
consents and instructions of the Sellers Representative authorized to be
made, taken or given pursuant to this _Section 9.20_ shall be final and
binding upon all the Represented Holders, and no Represented Holder shall have
any right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Sellers Representative
the Sellers Representatives Expense Fund, to be held to cover and reimburse
the fees, expenses and other monetary obligations incurred by the Sellers
Representative in connection with the carrying out by the Sellers
Representative of its duties under this _Section 9.20_. The Sellers
Representative Expense Fund will be used for the purposes of paying directly,
or reimbursing the Sellers Representative for, any third party expenses
pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto. The
Represented Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Sellers
Representative Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Sellers Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had
in any such interest or earnings. The Sellers Representative will not be
liable for any loss of principal of the Sellers Representative Expense Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Sellers Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the
completion of the Sellers Representatives responsibilities, the Sellers
Representative will deliver (or will cause to be delivered) the balance of the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to the Represented Holders in accordance with the Payments
Agreement, which shall provide for distribution as follows: (i) to the holder
of the Blocker Interest as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) such balance
by (B) the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (1) the number of Company Class A
Units held by the Blocker immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the
Diluted Unit Count and (ii) to each holder of Company Class A Units, RSUs,
Company Class B Units, Phantom Units or Management Class C Units (other than
any Company Class A Unit, any RSU, any Company Class B Unit and any Phantom
Unit to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)_ or converted pursuant to
_Section 2.07(d)_) immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) such balance by (B) the
quotient obtained by _dividing_ (1) the number of Company Class A Units, RSUs,
Company Class B Units, Phantom Units or Management Class C Units (other than
any Company Class A Unit, any RSU, any Company Class B Unit and any Phantom
Unit to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)_ or converted pursuant to
_Section 2.07(d)_) held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the Diluted Unit Count. In the event that any amount is owed to
the Sellers Representative, whether for fees, expense reimbursement or
indemnification, that is in excess of the amounts remaining in the Sellers
Representatives Expense Fund, the Sellers Representative shall be entitled
to be reimbursed by the Represented Holders on a pro rata basis (consistent
with the allocation in the immediately preceding sentence), and the
Represented Holders agree to so reimburse the Sellers Representative;
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate of

 



      
 

 



 

the applicable pro rata shares of all of the Represented Holders shall in all
cases sum to 100%. Upon written notice from the Sellers Representative to the
Represented Holders as to any such owed amount, including a reasonably
detailed description as to such owed amount, each Represented Holder shall
promptly deliver to the Sellers Representative full payment of his, her or
its pro rata share of such owed amount (determined on a basis consistent with
the allocation in the second sentence of this _Section 9.20(e)_). For tax
purposes, the Sellers Representative Expense Fund will be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Represented Holders at the time
of Closing.
