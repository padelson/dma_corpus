A holder of Dissenting Shares that complies with Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him or her in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal, in which case such Shares shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any required tax withholdings), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or book-entry share representing such Shares and other proper documentary evidence pursuant to Section 2.10.

 (c) _ Further Actions. _ At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including providing any required notice to holders of the Stock Options or Company Stock Awards) which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.9.

Until properly surrendered, each outstanding certificate or book-entry share that, before the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in the Merger. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of certificates or book-entry shares. Such payment of the Merger Consideration shall be made to the holder of record by bank check; _provided_ , that any holder of record entitled to a payment in excess of $500,000 shall have 

  

       

Table of Contents

payment shall be made net of any applicable wire transfer fees. If any Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the
certificate or book-entry share surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the certificate or book-entry
shares surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  

    
 (c) _ Termination of Funds; No Liability. _ At any time after one (1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of certificates or book-entry shares representing shares of Company Common Stock and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their certificates or book-entry shares, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock immediately before the Merger for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

    
 (d) _ Withholding Rights. _ Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any other applicable Legal Requirement (including state, local and foreign laws). To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the payees in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

    
 (e) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. _ In the event any certificate representing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent or Parent (as applicable) shall, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, pay the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in the Merger; _provided_ , that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to post a bond in such sum as Parent may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.11 _ Stock Transfer Books. _ All Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of the certificates representing Shares or book-entry shares in accordance with the provisions of this Article II will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofor represented by such certificates and to the book-entry shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If certificates or book-entry shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in Section 2.8(a) hereof, for each share of Common Stock formerly represented by such certificates.

 (a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects and to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Persons who were its directors and officers at any time before or as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Company\'s Organizational Documents or any indemnification agreement between the Company and such directors or officers, each as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Indemnification Provisions_ "), with respect to claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacities as officers or directors, in each case occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Organizational Documents of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or

otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnified Parties. Any claims for indemnification made under this Section
6.4(a) on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive
such anniversary until the final resolution thereof.

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage (which by its terms shall survive the Merger) for the Indemnified Parties, which shall provide such Indemnified Parties with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time for claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time that is no less favorable than the Company\'s existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate annual premiums in any one year for such insurance an amount in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (or such coverage as is available for such amount). The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid "tail" insurance policy has been obtained before the Effective Time for purposes of this Section 6.4(b), which policy provides the Indemnified Parties with coverage no less favorable than the Company\'s existing policy for a period of six years with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained before the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a period of six years from the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.4 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.4 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of and may enforce this Section 6.4). 

  

 (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

arising out of any breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement delivered in connection herewith or any fraud.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by Parent or the Guarantors in accordance with the terms of Section 8.4(b), the Company\'s right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.4(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors for any breach, loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Guarantors shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the Confidentiality Agreement), in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Legal Requirement or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another person or otherwise.

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company in accordance with the terms of Section 8.4(a), Parent\'s right to receive payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.4(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company for any breach, loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, the Company shall have no further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the Confidentiality Agreement), in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Legal Requirement or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another person or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company, then (i) in no event shall the Company have any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the transactions related thereto (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) in excess of an aggregate amount equal to, or other than in respect of, the Termination Fee, whether to the Parent, Merger Sub or to any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member, manager, agent or affiliate thereof or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member, manager, agent or affiliate of any of the foregoing, and (ii) neither Parent or Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek any specific performance remedies pursuant to Section 9.10 (other than to specifically enforce its right to be paid the Termination Fee).

 (ii) Parent shall pay to the Company, or cause to be paid, an amount equal to Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($7,500,000.00) in cash (the " _Regulatory Termination Fee_ "), such payment to be made within two (2) business days after such termination, if (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (solely insofar as it relates to an Antitrust Order) or Section 8.2(b)(i) or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(i) _and_ (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to consent to or implement any Material Divestiture Action and such failure to consent to or implement any Material Divestiture Action shall have been the cause of the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(d) or Section 7.2(b) to have been satisfied _and_ (C) all of the other conditions to Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s obligation

 Section 9.7 _ Counterparts. _ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute a single agreement. 

  

    
 Section 9.8 _ Amendment and Waiver. _ Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects (whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders and by the sole stockholder of the Merger Sub) at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any terms contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such stockholder approval of this Agreement, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that by law requires further approval or authorization of the Company Stockholders or the sole stockholder of the Merger Sub without such further approval or authorization. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all Parties. At any time before the Closing, as permitted by applicable Legal Requirements: (i) Parent may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company or waive compliance with any of the agreements of the Company or with any conditions to Parent\'s obligations; (ii) the Company may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub or waive compliance with any of the agreements of Parent or Merger Sub or with any conditions to the Company\'s obligations. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions (whether or not 

        

Table of Contents

  

similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided, nor shall any forbearance by a Party to seek a
remedy for noncompliance or breach by another Party be construed as a waiver
of any right or remedy with respect to such noncompliance or breach.

  

    
 Section 9.9 _ Severable Provisions. _ If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions, and any partially enforceable provisions to the extent enforceable, shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 

  

    
 Section 9.10 _ Specific Performance. _ The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed (including failing to take such actions as are required hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with their specified terms or were otherwise breached. It is therefore acknowledged and agreed that prior to the valid termination of the Agreement as permitted under Article VIII, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties agree that they will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. In the event a Party seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such Party, as applicable, shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order or injunction. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. For the avoidance doubt the Parties hereby agree that: (i) in the event the Parent Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee becomes payable in accordance with the terms of Section 8.4(b), the Company shall not be entitled to seek any specific performance remedies pursuant to this Section 9.10 (other than to specifically enforce its right to be paid any of the Parent Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable) and the Company\'s sole and exclusive remedies with respect to such matters shall be set forth in Section 8.4(b) and (ii) in the event the Termination Fee becomes payable in accordance with the terms of Section 8.4(a), neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek any specific performance remedies pursuant to this Section 9.10 (other than to specifically enforce its right to be paid the Termination Fee) and Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s sole and exclusive remedies with respect to such matters shall be set forth in Section 8.4(a). 

  

    
 Section 9.11 _ Exclusive Consent to Jurisdiction. _ Each of the Parties hereto: (i) irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for the recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement, and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), (ii) irrevocably consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of Delaware with respect to any and all disputes arising out of: (A) this Agreement, including the validity construction and interpretation hereof and the rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder and thereunder; (B) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (C) any matters related to but not covered hereby; (iii) agrees that it will not commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts, agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any claim that the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an 

        

Table of Contents

  

inconvenient forum, the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper,
or this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in any
such courts; (iv) agrees that service of process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be effected by notice by any of the means provided in Section
9.6; and (iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to
effect service of process in any other manner permitted by laws.

  

    
 Section 9.12 _ Waiver of Jury Trial. _ TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM WITH RESPECT TO ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. 

  

    
 Section 9.13 _ Attorneys\' Fees. _ The Prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, expert witness fees, court costs and all other costs and expenses incurred in any action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or as to any matters related to but not covered by this Agreement. "Prevailing Party" for purposes of this Section 9.13 includes a party who agrees to dismiss an action or proceeding upon the other\'s payment of the sums allegedly due or for performance of the covenants, undertakings or agreements allegedly breached, or who obtains substantially the relief it sought. 

  

    
 Section 9.14 _ Representations and Warranties. _ The respective representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company contained herein or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto prior to or at the Closing shall not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by any party hereto or any knowledge of any party (including any employee of any party) for whose benefit such representations and warranties are made. The representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained herein expire and shall be terminated and extinguished at the Effective Time. This Section 9.14 shall have no effect upon any other obligation of the Parties, whether to be performed before or after consummation of the Merger. 

  

    
 Section 9.15 _ No Third Party Beneficiaries. _ Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties who are signatories hereto any right, benefit or remedy of any nature; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, Section 6.4. 

  

    
 Section 9.16 _ Fees and Expenses. _ Subject to the provisions of Section 8.4, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses; _provided_ that the fees and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger shall be borne equally by Parent and the Company; _provided further_ that Parent and the Company shall be equally responsible for all expenses and filing fees (other than expenses of counsel to the Company) incurred or paid in connection with filings pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
