STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made as of April 15, 2013,
by and among LITTELFUSE, INC. ("Buyer"), and KEY SAFETY SYSTEMS, INC.
("Seller"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings
set forth in Appendix A attached hereto.

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

Hamlin, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), including
through the Hamlin Companies, is engaged in the business of supplying the
automotive, industrial and consumer industries with sensor products through
its facilities located in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (the "Business").

  

  

Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding common stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of the Company (the "Company Shares"). With the exception of Hamlin
Mexico, each of the Hamlin Companies is a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Hamlin
Mexico (the "Hamlin Mexico Shares" and, together with the Company Shares, the
"Shares") are held by the Hamlin Mexico Shareholders, each of which are
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Seller.

  

  

Seller desires to sell, or cause to be sold, to Buyer, and Buyer desires to
purchase from Seller and the Hamlin Mexico Shareholders, as the case may be,
all of the Shares, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement.

  

  

AGREEMENTS

  

  

The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  

  

I. PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

  

  

1.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell and transfer, or cause to be sold
and transferred, to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller and
the Hamlin Mexico Shareholders, as the case may be, all of the Shares free and
clear of all Liens, other than restrictions on transfer under applicable
securities Laws.

  

  

1.2 Purchase Price. The consideration for the Shares will be an amount (the
"Purchase Price") equal to:

  

  

(a) $140,300,000 for the Company Shares (the "Company Purchase Price");

  

  

(b) $4,700,000 for the Hamlin Mexico Shares (the "Hamlin Mexico Purchase
Price");

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) plus or minus, as the case may be, the amount by which Closing Working
Capital is greater than or less than, respectively, the Target Working
Capital; provided however, that if the Closing Working Capital is no less than
$20,500,000 or no more than $21,500,000, there shall be no adjustment of the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) (the "Working Capital
Adjustment"). "Closing Working Capital" means the amount calculated by
subtracting the Current Liabilities of the Hamlin Companies as of the Closing
Date from the Current Assets of the Hamlin Companies as of the Closing Date in
accordance with the calculation shown on Schedule 1.2. "Current Assets" means
that portion of the assets of the Hamlin Companies that constitute current
assets as determined in accordance with GAAP (excluding all Cash and Cash
Equivalents and all income Tax assets), and "Current Liabilities" means
liabilities of the Hamlin Companies that constitute current liabilities as
determined in accordance with GAAP (excluding the Transaction Expenses, all
income Tax liabilities and the current portion of any Debt). The "Target
Working Capital" is $21,000,000;

  

  

(d) plus all Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Hamlin Companies as of the
Closing Date (the "Closing Cash");

  

  

(e) minus all Transaction Expenses that have not been paid prior to the
Closing Date, whether or not the Hamlin Companies or Seller has been billed
for such expenses (the "Closing Transaction Expenses"); and

  

  

(f) minus all Debt of the Hamlin Companies as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Indebtedness").

  

  

1.3 Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be paid as follows:

  

  

(a) No later than the third Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (1) a closing statement (which shall be
attached to this Agreement as Schedule 1.3(a)), setting forth in detail the
Seller's good faith estimate of (i) the amount by which the Closing Working
Capital is greater than or less than, respectively, the Target Working Capital
(the "Estimated Working Capital"), (ii) the Closing Cash (the "Estimated
Closing Cash"), (iii) the Closing Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated
Transaction Expenses"), and (iv) the Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated
Closing Indebtedness"), in each case estimated as of the Closing Date, and (2)
all books, records, accounting records and accounting work papers necessary to
compute and verify the information set forth in such closing statement. The
"Estimated Purchase Price" shall equal the Purchase Price plus or minus the
Estimated Working Capital plus the Estimated Closing Cash minus the Estimated
Transaction Expenses minus the Estimated Closing Indebtedness. If Buyer
reasonably believes the Estimated Purchase Price delivered by Seller is
unreasonable, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. If any disputed matter cannot be resolved, the Estimated Purchase
Price will be calculated based upon the Seller's position concerning such
disputed matter without prejudice to the right of Buyer to raise such disputed
matter again in accordance with the determination of the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 1.4.

  

  

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the
following:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) A cash payment in an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price (in
accordance with Section 1.3(a)) minus the Escrow Fund (the "Closing Payment"),
with such payment made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts as specified in Schedule 1.3(b); and

  

  

(ii) A cash payment to Bank of America, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent") of
$7,250,000 (the "Escrow Fund") into escrow to be held and distributed by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Escrow Agreement").

  

  

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after the calculation of the Final Purchase
Price becomes final and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 1.4, Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, shall make the following payment:

parties in writing (the "Reviewing Accountant"). Seller and Buyer shall
jointly instruct the Reviewing Accountant that it (A) shall act as an expert
and not as an arbitrator, (B) shall review only the matters that were included
in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in dispute between the parties,

reasonable judgment, having due regard for commercial sensitivities) and (y)
regularly review with Seller the progress of any notifications or filings with
a view to obtaining the antitrust clearance at the earliest reasonable
opportunity.

  

  

(d) Seller agrees to diligently assist and cooperate with, and to use its

this Agreement shall be terminable by Buyer in accordance with Section
10.1(c). Neither the supplementation of the Schedules pursuant to the
obligation in this Section 5.6 nor any disclosure after the date hereof of the
untruth of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement shall operate
as a cure of the failure to disclose the information, or a cure of the breach
of any representation or warranty made herein, and determination of any
liability for breach of representations or warranties either at signing or at

its Representatives to hold, in confidence any confidential data or
information made available to Buyer in connection with this Agreement with
respect to the Seller, the Hamlin Mexico Shareholders, the Hamlin Companies
and their respective Affiliates, and the Business using the same standard of

(excluding any Confidential Information related to the Supply Agreement).

forth on Exhibit B (the "Transition Services Agreement").

  

  

6.6 Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any further
actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the
parties will take such further actions (including the execution and delivery
of such further documents and instruments) as any other party may reasonably
request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the
requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefore).

  

  

6.7 Press Releases. No party to this Agreement shall give notice to third
parties or otherwise make any public statement or releases concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) as required by
applicable law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange (with it
being agreed that the initial filing by the Buyer in compliance therewith will
be in substantially the form of Exhibit C attached hereto) or (b) for such
written information as shall have been approved in writing as to form and
content by the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer will consult with each other concerning the
means by which any employee, customer or supplier of the Hamlin Companies or
any other Person having any business relationship with the Hamlin Companies
will be informed of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing Buyer shall be permitted to
issue press releases, make public announcements and communicate with
employees, customers, suppliers and other Persons having business
relationships with the Business without the consent or participation of
Seller, provided that such communications are in compliance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, and provided further that, to the extent such
communications pertain to the financial terms contemplated by this Agreement,
such communications do not contain such financial terms beyond those set forth
in Exhibit C.

  

  

6.8 Covenant Not to Compete; Non-Solicitation of Employees.

  

  

(a) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, disclose or use
any Confidential Information after the Closing (excluding any Confidential
Information related to the Supply Agreement). In the event that Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries is requested or required pursuant to written or oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigation demand, or similar process to
disclose any Confidential Information, Seller will notify Buyer promptly of
the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.8(a). If, in
the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller
is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, then Seller may
disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that
Seller shall use its best efforts to obtain, at the request of Buyer, an order
or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer
shall designate. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any Confidential
Information that is generally available to the public immediately prior to the
time of disclosure unless such Confidential Information is so available due to
the actions of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Seller agrees that, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
on the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, for itself or any other
Person:

  

  

(i) engage in the Restricted Business or any business that competes with the
Restricted Business or invest in, own, manage, operate, consult with, provide
financing to, or join, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of, or the provision of financing to, any Person engaged
in the Restricted Business or any business that competes with the Restricted
Business, in each case anywhere in the Applicable Area; or

  

  

(ii) (A) call upon, solicit or provide services to any customer with the
intent of selling or attempting to sell any products or services similar to
those offered by the Restricted Business or (B) induce or attempt to induce
any customer, client, supplier or other business relation of the Hamlin
Companies to cease doing business or materially reduce its business with the
Hamlin Companies with respect to the Restricted Business (including, without
limitation, by making any negative or disparaging statements or communications
regarding any of the Hamlin Companies or any of their operations, officers,
directors or investors).

  

  

(c) Seller agrees that, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, for itself or any other
Person (i) hire or engage or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ
or engage or enter into any business relationship with any Person employed by
any of the Hamlin Companies or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any employee
of the Hamlin Companies to leave the employ of the Hamlin Companies, or in any
way interfere with the relationship between the Hamlin Companies and any
employee thereof, provided that nothing contained herein shall prevent the
Seller from (x) making any general media advertisement or non-directed search
inquiry and hiring any line worker, administrative support or clerical
employee who responds to such an advertisement or is identified in connection
with such non-directed search inquiring, or (y) employing any such employee
who has been terminated by the Hamlin Companies prior to the commencement of
employment discussions between the Seller and such employee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The parties specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) the character,
periods and geographical area and the scope of the restrictions on Seller's
activities in this Section 6.8 are fair and reasonably required for the
protection of Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) the remedy at law for any
breach of this Section 6.8 will be inadequate and that Buyer, in addition to
any other relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction, without the necessity of proving actual damage or any
requirement for the posting of a bond or other security, enjoining any such
breach and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions.

  

  

(e) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that
any term or provision of this Section 6.8 is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed. In the event of litigation involving this Section
6.8, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for all
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with any such litigation, including any appeal
therefrom. The existence of any claim or cause of action by Seller against
Buyer, any Hamlin Company or any of their respective Affiliates, whether
predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to
the enforcement by Buyer of the provisions of this Section 6.8, which will be
enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by Buyer or any Hamlin
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will not be prohibited from
pursuing such claims or causes of action against Buyer or any Hamlin Company.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.8: (i) nothing
in Section 6.8(b)(i) will restrict the Seller from purchasing or otherwise
acquiring in the aggregate up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of
any publicly traded corporation; (ii) nothing in Section 6.8(b)(i) will
restrict the Seller from purchasing or otherwise acquiring a Person engaged in
the Restricted Business, but only if the gross sales of such Person
attributable to the Restricted Business are less than 10% of such Person's
total gross sales; and (iii) the acquisition of the Seller by a Person that is
engaged in the Restricted Business prior to such acquisition (the "Acquiring
Company") will not constitute a breach of Section 6.8 and, moreover, the
provisions of Section 6.8 will not apply to any such Acquiring Company or its
Affiliates.

  

  

6.9 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

  

  

(a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Hamlin Companies as provided in the articles of
incorporation, bylaws, or other governing documents, of the Hamlin Companies,
as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring through the
Closing Date, will survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and will continue in full force and effect thereafter for a
period of six (6) years.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36

enforceable by, such directors or officers, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Buyer and its successors and assigns.

all intercompany notes between the Hamlin Companies and Seller and/or a
Subsidiary of Seller shall be eliminated (which may include the netting of
receivables and payables, contributions to equity and dividends) prior to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any trade payables and trade
receivables incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business between the Hamlin
Companies and Seller and/or a Subsidiary of Seller are reflected in the
Closing Working Capital, then such trade payables and trade receivables shall
not be settled prior to the Closing. Seller shall cause the transactions
identified on Schedule 6.10 to be effected prior to the Closing.

  

  

6.11 Release. If and only if the Closing occurs, Seller, for itself and its
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasors"), hereby forever fully
and irrevocably releases and discharges each of the Hamlin Companies, and each
of their respective predecessors, successors, direct or indirect subsidiaries
and past and present stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, and other representatives (collectively, the "Released
Parties") from any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, debts, agreements,
obligations, promises, judgments, or liabilities of any kind whatsoever in law
or equity and causes of action of every kind and nature, or otherwise
(including, claims for damages, costs, expense, and attorneys', brokers' and
accountants fees and expenses) arising out of or related to events, facts,
conditions or circumstances existing or arising prior to the Closing Date,
which the Releasors can, shall or may have against the Released Parties,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, unanticipated as well as
anticipated (collectively, the "Released Claims"), and hereby irrevocably
agree to refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any claim or demand or
commencing (or causing to be commenced) any Proceeding of any kind, in any
court or before any tribunal, against any Released Party based upon any
Released Claim. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 6.11,
"Released Claims" does not include, and the provisions of this Section 6.11
shall not release or otherwise diminish, (i) the obligations of Buyer or the
Hamlin Companies set forth in or arising under any provisions of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or (ii) the obligations of the Hamlin
Companies under any agreements relating to products or services sold to the
Releasors before or after the Closing Date.

employees of the Hamlin Companies (including any employees transferred
pursuant to Section 6.15) which become due or are otherwise required to be
made solely as a result of the Closing, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or as a result of any change of control or other similar
provisions, including all related payroll, employment or other Taxes, if any,
required to be paid by any of the Hamlin Companies with respect to the
foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller will not have any obligation
under this Section 6.13 for any such payments, bonuses or severance
obligations which become payable after the occurrence of an additional event
(e.g. termination of employment) following the Closing. To the extent not
included in the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Article
I, the Seller shall bear the cost of and, if applicable, promptly reimburse
Buyer and Hamlin Companies for, all Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Transaction Expenses.

  

  

6.14 Retention of Employees. The parties agree that the Seller will (or will
cause its Subsidiaries to) retain the employment of the individuals listed on
Schedule 6.14 such that, effective as of the Closing, none of those
individuals will be employed by any of the Hamlin Companies. All costs
associated with such transfers will be borne by Seller.

  

  

6.15 Transfer of Employees. The parties agree that Buyer will cause one of the
Hamlin Companies to offer employment to each of the individuals listed on

and pay, and shall indemnify and hold the Buyer's Indemnified Persons harmless

this Agreement.

election. In particular, and not by way of limitation, in order to effect such

added, stock transfer, gross receipts, stamp duty and real, personal, or

(collectively, "Losses") (including any Losses suffered or incurred after the
end of any applicable survival period, provided that an indemnification claim
with respect to such Loss is made pursuant to this Article IX prior to the end
of any applicable survival period) resulting from, relating to, arising out of
or based upon:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) Any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in
Article II or Article III of this Agreement;

  

  

(b) Any breach of any covenant, agreement or other obligation in this
Agreement of the Hamlin Companies (prior to the Closing Date) or Seller;

  

  

(c) Any obligation of any of the Hamlin Companies in effect as of the Closing
Date to indemnify or hold harmless any current (as of the Closing Date) or
former director or officer of any of the Hamlin Companies for claims that
arise before or after the Closing Date but relate to periods prior to the
Closing Date;

  

  

(d) Any obligation of any of the Hamlin Companies in excess of $50,000 with
respect to the potential claim identified on Schedule 9.1(d) (the "Indemnified
Claim #1"), provided that, notwithstanding Section 9.3, Seller shall have sole
control of the defense or settlement of Indemnified Claim #1, and provided
further that Seller's indemnification obligations shall not arise unless Buyer
receives a third party claim relating to Indemnified Claim #1 and Buyer's
Indemnified Persons assert a claim under this subsection (d) in writing on or
before the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date (in which case the
liability for such claim will continue until such claim is resolved); and

  

  

(e) Any third-party infringement claim (or threatened infringement claim)
asserted in writing by the person described on Schedule 9.1(e) or any
transferee, assignee, or successor (the "Claimant") on or before the 42nd-
month "anniversary" of the Closing Date (in which case the liability for such
claim will continue until such claim is resolved) relating to the matter
described on Schedule 9.1(e) (the "Indemnified Claim #2"), provided that,
notwithstanding Section 9.3, Buyer shall have sole control of the defense of
Indemnified Claim #2, subject to Seller's approval (which will not be
unreasonably denied, delayed or conditioned) of any monetary settlement
related thereto, and provided further that, notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 9.6(c), Buyer will be entitled to the Losses specified in and subject
to the terms set forth in Schedule 9.1(e).

  

  

In addition to the foregoing, none of Buyer or its Affiliates will institute
or pursue a cancellation proceeding against the Claimant or Indemnified Claim
#2 or otherwise engage directly or indirectly with the Claimant for a period
of six (6) months after the Closing. If, during such six (6)-month period,
Seller is successful in negotiating, at its sole cost and expense, an
assignment of the matter described in Schedule 9.1(e) to the Buyer or its
designee or a termination of the underlying claim (with such assignment or
termination in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer), then
Seller's obligations under Sections 9.1(e) and 9.5(c) and this paragraph will
be terminated. However, if the Seller is not successful within such six
(6)-month period in effecting such assignment or termination, then Seller
shall reimburse Buyer's Indemnified Persons, in an amount not to exceed
$25,000, for all fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees and the expenses of investigation and litigation) in relation to a
cancellation proceeding against the Claimant or Indemnified Claim #2 provided
that such cancellation proceeding is initiated on or before the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date. Buyer shall notify Seller of the institution
of such cancellation proceeding promptly after filing such proceeding, and
Buyer shall have control of such proceeding. Buyer shall submit invoices to
Seller for such fees, costs and expenses, and Seller shall remit payment to
Buyer within sixty (60) days of the date thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.2 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the provisions of this Article IX,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, and its officers, directors
and Affiliates ("Seller's Indemnified Persons") from and against, and shall
reimburse Seller's Indemnified Persons for, any and all Losses (including any
Losses suffered or incurred after the end of any applicable survival period,
provided that an indemnification claim with respect to such Loss is made
pursuant to this Article IX prior to the end of any applicable survival
period) resulting from, relating to, arising out of or based upon:

  

  

(a) Any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in Article
IV of this Agreement; and

  

  

(b) Any breach of any covenant, agreement or other obligation in this
Agreement of Buyer.

  

  

9.3 Defense of Third-Party Claims. If any Proceeding shall be instituted or
any claim is asserted by any third party in respect of which any party to this
Agreement may have an obligation to indemnify another party, the party
asserting such right to indemnity (the "Indemnified Party") shall give the
party from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") written notice
thereof, but any failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
it from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced thereby.
Such written notice shall describe the facts constituting the basis for such
third-party claim and the amount of the potential Loss, in each case, to the
extent known. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option and
expense, to participate in and control the defense of such proceeding or claim
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that:

  

  

(a) the Indemnifying Party must notify the Indemnified Party in writing within
30 days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of such claim that the
Indemnifying Party will so participate in and control the defense of such
proceeding or claim;

  

  

(b) the Indemnifying Party must provide the Indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will have the financial resources to defend against such claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder;

  

  

(c) the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of such claim actively and
diligently;

  

  

(d) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such claim and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling
of such claim;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing
to defend against such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld);

  

  

(f) no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof a
release from all liability of each Indemnified Party given by each claimant or
plaintiff in such legal proceeding; and

  

  

(g) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement of any claim to the extent such claim seeks an order, injunction,
non-monetary or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if
successful, the Indemnified Party believes is reasonably likely to materially
interfere with the business, operations, assets, condition (financial or
otherwise) or prospects of the Indemnified Party.

  

  

So long as all of the conditions described above are satisfied, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party under this
Agreement for any Legal Expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Party incurred at the request of the Indemnifying
Party. In the event that any of the conditions above is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim
in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs
of defending against such claim (including Legal Expenses), and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified
Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
of, or caused by such claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article IX.
The Indemnified Party will not settle or compromise any claim to the extent
that it involves money damages without the prior consent of the Indemnifying
Party, unless the Indemnifying Party has failed or refused to assist the
Indemnified Party in the defense of such Indemnified Claim or has unreasonably
withheld its consent to a proposed settlement or compromise of such claim or
unless the Indemnified Party waives any liability of the Indemnifying Party
for any Losses in connection with such Indemnified Claim.

  

  

9.4 Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
third-party claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party in writing, setting forth the obligation with respect to
which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to and the alleged basis for
such claim and, if known or reasonably ascertainable, the amount of the
liability asserted or which may be asserted by reason thereof, but any failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced thereby.

  

  

9.5 Survival. The representations and warranties and the pre-Closing covenants
of each party contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a
period ending on the fifteen (15) month "anniversary" of the Closing Date, at
which time such representations, warranties and pre-Closing covenants shall
terminate and thereafter be of no force and effect; provided, however, that:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 2.1
(Organization), Section 2.2 (Authority and Enforceability), Section 2.5
(Ownership of Shares), Section 3.1 (Organization) and Section 3.6
(Capitalization) shall survive indefinitely (collectively, the representations
and warranties described in this clause (a) are referred to as the
"Fundamental Representations");

  

  

(b) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in (i) Section 3.18
(Employee Benefit Plans) shall survive the Closing for a period ending on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time such representations and
warranties shall terminate and thereafter be of no force and effect and (ii)
Section 3.26 (Environmental Matters) shall survive the Closing for a period
ending on the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time such
representations and warranties shall terminate and thereafter be of no force
and effect;

  

  

(c) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.23
(Intellectual Property) relating to Indemnified Claim #2 shall survive the
Closing for a period ending on the 42nd-month "anniversary" of the Closing
Date, at which time such representations and warranties shall terminate and
thereafter be of no force and effect; and

  

  

(d) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.21 (Taxes
Returns and Taxes) shall survive until thirty (30) days after the running of
the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the taxable period to
which the particular claim relates, at which time such representations and
warranties shall terminate and thereafter be of no force and effect.

  

  

Any claim for indemnity under Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.2(a) shall be
asserted in writing within the foregoing time periods (provided, that any
claim related to fraudulent breaches of the representations, warranties or
pre-Closing covenants may be made at any time within the applicable statute of
limitations), in which case the liability for such claim will continue until
such claim is resolved. All of the post-Closing covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing, and each such surviving
covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing for the period contemplated
by its terms; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, any claim for
indemnity under Section 9.1(b) or (c), or Section 9.2(b) may be made at any
time within the applicable statute of limitations. The right to
indemnification, payment of any losses or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations will not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation.

  

  

9.6 Indemnification Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) Seller shall not be required to indemnify a Buyer's Indemnified Person
under Section 9.1(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of such claims
under this Agreement exceeds $1,087,500 (the "Basket"), and then Buyer's
Indemnified Persons may only assert claims for the excess of such aggregate
claims over the Basket; provided that the foregoing limitations shall not
apply in respect of any Losses relating to (i) breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or (ii) any fraudulent breach of a representation or warranty.

  

  

(b) In no event shall Seller's maximum aggregate liability for indemnification
under Section 9.1 exceed $14,500,000; provided that the foregoing limitations
shall not apply in respect of any Losses relating to (i) breaches of the
Fundamental Representations, (ii) breaches of the covenants or other
agreements set forth in Articles I, VIII or XI or Sections 5.9, 6.8, 6.13,
6.14 or 6.15; or (iii) any fraudulent breach of a representation, warranty
covenant or agreement.

  

  

(c) No Indemnified Party shall have a right to indemnification with respect to
any special, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages incurred or suffered
by an Indemnified Party under this Agreement (unless actually paid to a third
party), and in no event shall Losses include a Person's special, punitive,
exemplary or consequential damages (unless actually paid to a third party).

  

  

(d) To the extent that the board of directors or any senior executive officer
of Buyer or Seller or any Key Employee or their successor becomes aware that
the Buyer\'s Indemnified Persons or the Seller\'s Indemnified Persons (as the
case may be) are entitled to indemnification for a matter pursuant to this
Agreement, then such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled or
may be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX (that is, such
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such
Losses in the same manner that it would respond to such Losses in the Ordinary
Course of Business consistent with past practice in the absence of the
indemnification provided for in this Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure of any Indemnified Party to use such efforts to
mitigate shall not constitute a defense to, or in any way otherwise relieve
the Indemnifying Party of, the Indemnifying Party's obligations to indemnify
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement, but may be asserted by the
Indemnifying Party to reduce the amount of the indemnity. The amount of any
Losses for which indemnification is provided for under Section 9.1 or 9.2
shall be offset by (i) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party as a
result of any indemnification, contribution or other similar payment by any
third party, net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount, (ii) any insurance proceeds received by the
Indemnified Party from third party insurers with respect to such Losses, net
of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in collecting such amount
and any increased premiums resulting therefrom, and (iii) any (A) Tax benefits
arising from the incurrence or payment of any Losses actually realized by the
Indemnified Party by way of a reduction of cash Taxes payable, calculated on a
"with and without" basis, (B) less any Tax detriments to the Indemnified
Party, including any taxes payable by the Indemnified Party arising from the
receipt of the payment for the Loss and any reduction in the Indemnified
Party's future depreciation or amortization resulting from the Loss
(calculated on a present value basis). In calculating the amount of any such
Tax benefit pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the incurrence or payment of any
indemnified Losses. Buyer and Seller agree to (and agree to cause the other
Indemnified Parties to) use commercially reasonable efforts to make any claims
for insurance available from any third party insurers with respect to Losses
for which any Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder; provided,
that the costs incurred by such Indemnified Party in seeking such recovery
shall be included in its Losses for purposes of this Article IX. If any such
insurance proceeds are received by any Indemnified Party after receipt of any
indemnification payment pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party such portion of such
indemnification payment equal to the amounts so recovered or realized.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article IX shall be
treated by the parties to this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by Law. For purposes of determining the
amount of Losses resulting from any misrepresentation or breach of a
representation or warranty, all qualifications or exceptions in any
representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms "material",
"materiality", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or any
similar term or phrase shall be disregarded, it being the understanding of the
parties that for purposes of determining liability under this Article IX, the
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
shall be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in them.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Buyer's Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article IX for any Losses to the extent such Losses are reflected in the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash or in Closing Working Capital used to
determine the Final Purchase Price (including the Working Capital Adjustment).

  

  

(g) Seller's indemnification obligations under Section 9.1(a) with respect to
a breach of Seller's representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.26
shall not include the obligation to pay for or to reimburse Buyer for the cost
of any cleanup, removal, containment or remedial response (i) to achieve a
cleanup standard in excess of standards required under Environmental Laws
applicable to the industrial use of the applicable Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property, as the case may be, or (ii) that are not performed or
incurred in a commercially reasonable manner.

  

  

9.7 Indemnification Escrow.

  

  

(a) For as long as there are funds in the Escrow Fund, any and all amounts
payable pursuant to Section 9.1(a) by Seller as indemnifying party to a
Buyer's Indemnified Person will be paid in cash first out of the Escrow Fund,
and thereafter by Seller, in accordance with payment instructions provided by
Buyer. The existence of the Escrow Fund will not be deemed to limit the amount
of any allowable claims by a Buyer's Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement for Losses in excess of the amount of such escrowed funds. The
Escrow Fund shall be available for a period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) On the final day of the Escrow Period, Buyer and Seller shall promptly
execute and deliver a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent, directing the
Escrow Agent to disburse an amount equal to the then remaining Escrow Fund
(less any amounts to cover any outstanding claims) to Seller.

  

  

9.8 Exclusive Remedy

  

  

. Following the Closing and subject to the specific dispute resolution
mechanics provided in Article I and the parties right to seek specific
performance and injunctive relief to enforce the terms of any covenant in this
Agreement, indemnification pursuant to this Article IX shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the parties and any parties claiming by or through any
party (including the Buyer's Indemnified Persons and Seller's Indemnified
Persons) for any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or other obligation contained in this Agreement (other
than an inaccuracy or breach of Section 2.5 (Ownership of Shares or in the
case of fraud).

  

  

X. TERMINATION

  

  

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller;

  

  

(b) by either Buyer or Seller at any time after the date that is the three
(3)-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "Final Termination
Date"), provided that if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Final
Termination Date as the result of a breach of this Agreement and such breach
results in the inability of the breaching party to satisfy the conditions in
Article VII, then the breaching party may not avail itself of the right under
this Section 10.1, and provided further that in any such event, the non-
breaching party(ies) shall not be deprived of any remedy hereunder or at law
against the breaching party;

  

  

(c) by Buyer, by giving written notice to Seller in the event Seller is in
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination with any other such
breach, (i) would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) or
Section 7.1(b) not to be satisfied and (ii) is not cured (if curable) within
thirty (30) days following delivery by Buyer to Seller of written notice of
such breach;

  

  

(d) by Seller, by giving written notice to Buyer in the event Buyer is in
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination with any other such
breach, (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section
7.2(b) not to be satisfied and (ii) is not cured (if curable) within thirty
(30) days following delivery by Seller to Buyer of written notice of such
breach; or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) by either Buyer or Seller if a court of competent jurisdiction or
Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such Governmental Order shall have become final and
nonappealable.

  

  

10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall, subject to the last sentence
of this Section 10.2, forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners, members or
representatives, other than liability of the Buyer or the Seller, as the case
may be, for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination;
provided, however, that, in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1, the parties hereto acknowledge that it is the intention of the
parties hereto that no party shall have any remedy or right to recover for any
losses or damages resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty
contained herein. In determining losses or damages recoverable by a party
hereto for another party's breach, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that such losses and damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses
or out-of-pocket costs and shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by
such party or such party's stockholders (taking into consideration relevant
matters, including other opportunities and the time value of money), which
shall be deemed to be damages of such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this Section 10.2, Section 5.8 and Article XI shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

XI. OTHER PROVISIONS

  

  

11.1 Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules.

  

  

(a) All Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to
be and hereby are specifically made a part of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Schedules provide information with respect to, or otherwise qualify,
the representations, warranties and covenants in the corresponding sections of
this Agreement and any other sections of this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
applies to such other section of this Agreement. The inclusion of any
information in the Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgement, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms of the Agreement to be disclosed, is material to the Company, has or
would have a Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the Ordinary Course of
Business.

  

  

11.2 Amendment. This Agreement and the Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules
hereto may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the parties hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

11.3 No Waiver. No failure of any party to this Agreement to exercise any
power given it under this Agreement, or to insist upon strict compliance with
any provision of this Agreement, and no custom or practice at variance with
the terms of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver any such party's right
to demand strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

11.4 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, together
with the Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules hereto, (a) constitutes the entire
Agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties, and (b)
except with respect to the Persons referenced in Section 6.8, is not intended
to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

  

  

11.5 Governing Law. The laws of the state of Michigan, without giving effect
to any law or rule that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than

construction, performance and enforcement.

  

  

11.6 Forum Selection. Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial.

Agreement in any other court. The Buyer irrevocably consents to the service of
process out of any of the courts listed in this Section 11.6 by the mailing of
copies by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Buyer at its
address set forth in Section 11.7, such service to become effective 30 days
after such mailing. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND SHALL
CAUSE ITS INDEMNIFIED PARTIES TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS AND/OR THE TRANSACTIONS.
