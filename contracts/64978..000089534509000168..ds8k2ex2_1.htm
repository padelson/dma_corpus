ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGERS

 

 

1.1  The Mergers.

 

 

(a)  The Saturn Merger. (i) Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the NJBCA, at the Initial Effective Time, Merger Sub 1 shall be merged with
and into Saturn. As a result of the Saturn Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub 1 shall cease and Saturn shall continue as the
surviving corporation after the Saturn Merger (the "Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation").

 

 

(ii)  As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause
the Saturn Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger
relating to the Saturn Merger (the "Certificate of Saturn Merger") with the
Department of the Treasury of the State of New Jersey, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
NJBCA. The Saturn Merger shall become effective at such time at which the
Certificate of Saturn Merger is filed with the Department of Treasury of the
State of New Jersey or at such subsequent time as Mercury and Saturn shall
agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Saturn Merger (the date
and time the Saturn Merger becomes effective being the "Initial
Effective Time").

 

 

(iii)  At the Initial Effective Time, the effect of the Saturn Merger shall
be as provided in the applicable provisions of the NJBCA. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, at the Initial Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Saturn and Merger Sub
1 shall vest in the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Saturn and Merger Sub 1 shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b)  The Mercury Merger. (i) Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance
with the NJBCA, at the Subsequent Effective Time, Merger Sub 2 shall be
merged with and into Mercury. As a result of the Mercury Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub 2 shall cease and Mercury
shall continue as the surviving corporation after the Mercury Merger (the
"Mercury Merger Surviving Corporation").

 

 

(ii)  As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause
the Mercury Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger
relating to the Mercury Merger (the "Certificate of Mercury Merger" and
together with the Certificate of Saturn Merger, the "Certificates of Merger")
with the Department of the Treasury of the State of New Jersey, in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of,
the NJBCA. The Mercury Merger shall become effective at such time at which
the Certificate of Mercury Merger is filed with the Department of the
Treasury of the State of New Jersey or at such subsequent time as Mercury and
Saturn shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Mercury
Merger, but in any event immediately after the Initial Effective Time (the
date and time the Mercury Merger is effective being the "Subsequent
Effective Time").

 

 

(iii)  At the Subsequent Effective Time, the effect of the Mercury Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the NJBCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Subsequent Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Mercury and
Merger Sub 2 shall vest in the Mercury Merger Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Mercury and Merger Sub 2 shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Mercury Merger
Surviving Corporation.

 

 

1.2  Closing. The closing of the Mergers (the "Closing") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m. New York time on the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their nature,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in Article
VII, unless this Agreement shall have been theretofore terminated pursuant to
its terms; provided, however, that notwithstanding the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, if the proceeds of the
Financing are not then available in full pursuant to the Commitment Letter
(or if Financing Definitive Agreements have been entered into, pursuant to
such Financing Definitive Agreements) on the date that would otherwise be the
Closing Date, Mercury shall not be required to effect the Closing until such
date on which the proceeds of the Financing are available in full pursuant to
the Commitment Letter (or if Financing Definitive Agreements have been
entered into, pursuant to such Financing Definitive Agreements) (subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII as of
such date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may be consummated at
such other time or date as Mercury and Saturn may agree to in writing. The
date and time of the Closing is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Closing Date." The Closing shall be held at the offices of Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza, New York, New York 10004,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by Mercury and Saturn.

 

 

1.3  Certificates of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 

 

(a)  At the Initial Effective Time, by virtue of the Saturn Merger, the
certificate of incorporation of Saturn shall be amended to read in its
entirety as set forth in Exhibit A and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation, from
and after the Initial Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein and/or in accordance with applicable Law. The Saturn Board
shall take all action necessary so that, at the Initial Effective Time, the
bylaws of Saturn shall be amended to read in their entirety as set forth in

until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, in the certificate
of incorporation of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation and/or in

therein, in the certificate of incorporation of the Mercury Merger Surviving
Corporation and/or in accordance with applicable Law.

Initial Effective Time), each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation, (iii) except as otherwise indicated by Mercury in writing to

Mercury in writing to Saturn prior to the Closing, remove the persons who are
officers of Saturn immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time as
officers of Saturn effective as of the Initial Effective Time.

Time shall be the directors of the Mercury Merger Surviving Corporation from
and after the Subsequent Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Mercury Merger

any shares of Saturn Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(ii) or Section 2.1(a)(iv), or shares to be converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(v)) shall be converted into the right to receive (x) 0.5767 of

retired and shall cease to exist and each holder of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time
represented any such shares of Saturn Common Stock ("Saturn

such shares of Saturn Common Stock, except the right to receive the Saturn
Merger Consideration and as provided by Law. Each share of
Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Initial Effective Time shall remain outstanding from and after the Initial
Effective Time as one share of Convertible Preferred Stock of the Saturn
Merger Surviving Corporation in accordance with the terms of Annex A of the
certificate of incorporation of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
("Saturn Surviving Corporation Convertible Preferred Stock"). Without any
action on the part of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, all
outstanding certificates which immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective
Time represented such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and book-entry
shares which immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time represented such
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall, from and after the Initial
Effective Time continue to represent a number of shares of Saturn Surviving
Corporation Convertible Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby immediately prior to the
Initial Effective Time.

 

 

(ii)  Mercury, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 Owned Shares. All shares of
Saturn Common Stock owned by Mercury, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 or any of
their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease

without any conversion thereof.

 

 

(v)  Specified Subsidiary Owned Shares. Each share of Saturn Common Stock

immediately preceding the Closing Date.

of the Mercury Merger and without any action on the part of Mercury, Merger

(i)  Conversion Generally. Each share of Mercury Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time (other
than any shares of Mercury Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.1(b)(ii) or Section 2.1(b)(iv)) shall be converted into one (1) validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation Common Stock (the "Mercury Merger Consideration"). All such
shares of Mercury Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Subsequent Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and
each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Subsequent Effective Time represented any such shares of Mercury Common Stock
("Mercury Certificates") or book-entry shares which immediately prior to

Corporation Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Mercury Common
Stock represented thereby immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time.

 

 

(ii)  Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 Owned Shares. All shares of
Mercury Common Stock owned by Saturn, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 or any of
their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist and no Mercury Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be

Initial Effective Time or Subsequent Effective Time, as applicable, the
outstanding shares of Saturn Common Stock or Mercury Common Stock shall have
been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, split, combination,
contribution or exchange of shares, the Saturn Merger Consideration and the
Mercury Merger Consideration and any adjustments or payments to be made under
Section 2.4 and any other number or amount contained in this Agreement which
is based upon the price of the Mercury Common Stock or the Saturn Common
Stock or the number of shares of Saturn Common Stock or Mercury Common Stock,
as the case may be, shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders
of Mercury Common Stock and Saturn Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

 

2.2  Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a)  Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Initial Effective Time, (i)
Saturn shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a commercial bank
or trust company designated by Mercury and reasonably satisfactory to Saturn
(the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Saturn
Common Stock (x) book-entry shares (which, to the extent subsequently
requested, shall be exchanged for certificates) representing the total number
of shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable as
Stock Consideration pursuant to the Saturn Merger and (y) the Repayment
Amount to the extent provided by the Mercury Overseas Subsidiaries in
accordance with Section 6.14, in cash, in United States dollars, and (ii)
Mercury shall, with the cooperation of Saturn to the extent that Saturn is
the borrower under the Financing, cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Saturn Common
Stock, proceeds of the Financing, in cash, in United States dollars, which,
together with the Repayment Amount, shall be an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate cash amount payable as Cash Consideration (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) in the Saturn Merger)
(such shares and cash shall constitute the "Exchange Fund"). Any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by shareholders of Saturn entitled
thereto one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Initial Effective Time
shall be returned to the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation and such
shareholders shall thereafter look only to the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Saturn Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed
by such shareholders five (5) years after the Initial Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the
extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

 

(b)  Exchange Procedures. The Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to promptly (and in any event no more than
five (5) Business Days) after the Initial Effective Time, mail to each holder
of record of a Saturn Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be
in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Saturn Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Saturn Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Saturn Certificates in
exchange for the Saturn Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Saturn Common Stock formerly represented by such Saturn Certificates. Upon
surrender of a Saturn Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions, the Exchange Agent shall issue and deliver to the holder
of such Saturn Certificate the number of whole shares of Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation Common Stock (in the form of book-entry shares, unless
the holder of such Saturn Certificate expressly requests that such shares be
delivered in certificated form of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common
Stock) and a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to Sections 2.1(a)(i), 2.2(e) and 2.2(i) of
this Agreement in respect of the shares of Saturn Common Stock formerly
represented by such Saturn Certificate, and the Saturn Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Saturn Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of Saturn, the Saturn Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Saturn Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if
the Saturn Certificate formerly representing such shares of Saturn Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Saturn Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Initial Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Saturn Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Saturn Common Stock formerly represented by such
Saturn Certificate and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon. Promptly (and in any event no more than five (5)
Business Days) after the Initial Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
issue and deliver to each holder of Saturn Book-Entry Shares the number of
whole shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock (in the form
of book-entry shares, unless the holder of such Saturn Book-Entry Shares
expressly requests that such shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
Common Stock be delivered in certificated form) and a check or wire transfer
for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(i), 2.2(e) and 2.2(i) of this Agreement in respect of such
Mercury Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a
Saturn Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent.

 

 

(c)  Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Saturn Common
Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock, with a record
date after the Initial Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Saturn Certificate, unless and until the holder of such Saturn
Certificate shall surrender such Saturn Certificate. Subject to the effect of
abandoned property, escheat or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Saturn Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of whole
shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Initial Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Initial
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

 

(d)  Further Rights in Saturn Common Stock and Mercury Common Stock. The
Saturn Merger Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of a share of
Saturn Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of Saturn Common Stock (other than the right to
receive dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section
2.2(c)). The Mercury Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a share
of Mercury Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of Mercury Common Stock.

 

 

(e)  Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock or
book-entry credit of the same will be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of shares of Saturn Common Stock, but in lieu thereof each holder of Saturn
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock upon surrender for exchange
of Saturn Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Saturn
Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be received by such holder)
shall receive an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the
Mercury Stock Measurement Price. Such payment shall occur as soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to each former holder of Saturn Common Stock with respect to any fractional
shares and, in the case of a holder of Saturn Certificates, following
compliance by such holder with the exchange procedures set forth in Section
2.2(b) and in the letter of transmittal. No dividend or distribution with
respect to Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a shareholder
of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(f)  Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation on a daily basis in (i) short term direct obligations of the
United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days,
(ii) short term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and
interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating
from either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's; provided,
that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former
holders of Saturn Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.
If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall promptly be paid to the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(g)  No Liability. The Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable to any former holder of shares of Saturn Common Stock, for the
Saturn Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other
applicable Law.

 

 

(h)  Lost Certificates. If any Saturn Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Saturn Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Saturn Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Saturn Certificate
the Saturn Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Saturn
Common Stock formerly represented by such Saturn Certificate and any dividend
or other distribution to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), in each case without any interest thereon.

 

 

(i)  Withholding. Each of Saturn, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of local, state, federal, or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Saturn, the
Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Saturn, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

 

2.3  Stock Transfer Books.

 

 

(a)  At the Initial Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Saturn shall
be closed with respect to shares of Saturn Common Stock and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Saturn Common
Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of Saturn.

 

 

(b)  At the Subsequent Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Mercury
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Mercury Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the
records of Saturn.

 

 

2.4  Saturn Options and Other Equity Awards.

 

 

(a)  Saturn Options. As of the Initial Effective Time, each then-
outstanding Saturn Option, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into
an option entitling its holders to acquire, upon exercise, a number of shares
of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock equal to the product of
the (x) Saturn Award Exchange Ratio and (y) the number of shares of
Saturn Common Stock subject to such converted Saturn Option immediately prior
to the Initial Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at
an exercise price per share of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common
Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per
share of Saturn Common Stock to which such Saturn Option was subject
immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time by (y) the Saturn Award
Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Except as specifically
provided in the preceding sentence, each converted Saturn Option will
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable
to the Saturn Option immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. "Saturn
Award Exchange Ratio" means the sum of (A) the number of shares of Saturn
Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock equal to the Stock Consideration,
expressed as a decimal plus (B) the fraction resulting from dividing the
Cash Consideration by the closing price per share of the Mercury Common Stock
on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 

 

(b)  Saturn Deferred Stock Units/Saturn Restricted Stock Units. As of the
Initial Effective Time, each then-outstanding Saturn Deferred Stock Unit and
Saturn Restricted Stock Unit will be adjusted so that its holder will be
entitled to receive, upon settlement thereof, a number of shares of Saturn
Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock equal to the product of the (x)
Saturn Award Exchange Ratio and (y) the number of shares of Saturn Common
Stock subject to such Saturn Deferred Stock Unit or Saturn Restricted Stock
Unit, as applicable, immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. Except
as specifically provided in the preceding sentence, each Saturn Deferred
Stock Unit or Saturn Restricted Stock Unit, as applicable, will continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Saturn
Deferred Stock Unit or Saturn Restricted Stock Unit, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time.

 

 

(c)  Saturn Performance Awards. As of the Initial Effective Time, each then-
outstanding Saturn performance-based award or Saturn performance-based share
unit award granted under any of the Saturn Equity Plans (each, a "Saturn
Performance Award") will vest in accordance with the final sentence of this
paragraph and be adjusted (each, an "Adjusted Saturn Performance Award")
into the number of shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock
determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares subject to such Saturn
Performance Award that vest pursuant to this paragraph by (ii) the
Saturn Award Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided in
the preceding sentence, each Adjusted Saturn Performance Award will continue
to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
Saturn Performance Award immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time.

 

 

(d)  Miscellaneous; Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation Common Stock will be issued upon exercise or settlement
of any Saturn Options, Saturn Deferred Stock Units, Saturn Restricted Stock
Units and Saturn Performance Awards, as applicable, after the Initial
Effective Time, but in lieu thereof each holder of Saturn Options, Saturn
Deferred Stock Units, Saturn Restricted Stock Units and Saturn Performance
Awards who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Saturn
Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock in connection with any such
exercise or settlement (after aggregating all fractional shares of Saturn
Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be received by such holder in
connection with such exercise or settlement) shall receive an amount of cash
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of such fraction multiplied by the closing price for the shares of
Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock on the NYSE on the trading
day immediately prior to such exercise or settlement.

 

 

(e)  Further Actions. Prior to the Initial Effective Time, Saturn and
its Subsidiaries shall pass such resolutions as may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.4. As soon as practicable after
the Initial Effective Time, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation will
deliver to the holders of the Saturn Options, Saturn Deferred Stock Units,
Saturn Restricted Stock Units and Saturn Performance Awards appropriate
notices setting out the terms applicable to such Saturn Options, Saturn
Deferred Stock Units, Saturn Restricted Stock Units and Saturn Performance
Awards.

 

 

2.5  Mercury Options and Other Equity Awards.

 

 

(a)  At the Subsequent Effective Time (i) each then outstanding equity-based
award including, without limitation, any stock options, performance share
units and restricted stock units, granted pursuant to any Mercury Stock
Incentive Plan that provide for settlement in, or the holder thereof to
receive upon exercise thereof, shares of Mercury Common Stock (collectively,
the "Mercury Equity Awards"), whether or not fully vested and exercisable,
and (ii) each of the Mercury Stock Incentive Plans and all agreements
thereunder, shall be assumed by the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation. Each
Mercury Equity Award so assumed by the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such Mercury Equity Award immediately before the
Subsequent Effective Time under the Mercury Stock Incentive Plans and the
agreements thereunder pursuant to which such Mercury Equity Award was
granted, except that each Mercury Equity Award will be exercisable, or
settled upon vesting, as applicable, for shares of Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation Common Stock in lieu of shares of Mercury Common Stock.

 

 

(b)  Further Actions. Prior to the Subsequent Effective Time, Mercury
and its Subsidiaries shall pass such resolutions as may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.5. As soon as practicable after
the Subsequent Effective Time, Mercury will deliver to the holders of the
Mercury Equity Awards appropriate notices, setting out the terms applicable
to such Mercury Equity Awards.

 

 

2.6  Reservation of Shares; Registration. The Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Saturn Options, Saturn
Deferred Stock Units, Saturn Restricted Stock Units and Saturn Performance
Awards under Section 2.4 and Mercury Equity Awards under Section 2.5, as
applicable. Promptly after the Initial Effective Time, the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation shall file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) or shall file an
amendment to an existing registration statement, as necessary, with respect
to the shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to
the Saturn Options, Saturn Deferred Stock Units, Saturn Restricted Stock
Units, Saturn Performance Awards and Mercury Equity Awards and shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus contained
therein) for so long as such Saturn Options, Saturn Deferred Stock Units,
Saturn Restricted Stock Units, Saturn Performance Awards and Mercury Equity
Awards, as applicable, remain outstanding.

 

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SATURN AND

 

MERGER SUB 1 AND MERGER SUB 2

 

 

Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 hereby, jointly and severally,
represent and warrant to Mercury that (a) except as set forth on the
disclosure letter delivered to Mercury by Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2 on the date of the execution of this Agreement (the "Saturn
Disclosure Letter"), which identifies items of disclosure by reference to
a particular section or subsection of this Agreement (it being understood
that any matter disclosed pursuant to any section or subsection of the Saturn
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed for all purposes of this
Agreement and the Saturn Disclosure Letter, as long as the relevance of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent) and (b) other than with respect to
Sections 3.5, 3.6(a), and 3.6(f), except as disclosed in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K of Saturn for the year ended December 31, 2008 (the "Saturn Form
10-K") (other than disclosures in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking
Statements" sections of such reports or any other disclosures in such reports
to the extent they are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature):

 

 

3.1  Organization and Qualification. Each of Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger
Sub 2 is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of New Jersey, and each of Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2 has all requisite corporate power and authority to own and operate its
properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted. Each of Saturn,
Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 is duly qualified or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of good standing), in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of
property or the conduct of its businesses as now conducted requires it to so
qualify or be licensed, except where the failure to be so qualified has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Saturn Material Adverse Effect. Saturn has made available to
Mercury a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, each as amended to date, of Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2.
Saturn is not in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws.

 

 

3.2  Significant Subsidiaries. Section 3.2 of the Saturn Disclosure Letter
sets forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and the
authorized and outstanding capital stock of, and/or other Equity Interests
in, each Significant Subsidiary of Saturn. Except as set forth in Section
3.2 of the Saturn Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of Saturn, neither
Saturn nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries owns any publicly listed or
registered shares of stock, or other publicly listed or registered Equity
Interest in any other Person other than Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Saturn Disclosure Letter, there are
no contractual obligations of Saturn or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
to make any loan to, or any investment (in the form of a capital contribution
or otherwise) in, any Significant Subsidiary of Saturn or any other Person.
Each Significant Subsidiary of Saturn is either wholly owned by Saturn or by
one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Saturn as indicated in Section 3.2
of the Saturn Disclosure Letter. Each outstanding share of capital stock of
or other Equity Interest in each of Saturn's Significant Subsidiaries is
owned by Saturn or by a wholly owned Subsidiary of Saturn free and clear of
any Liens other than Permitted Liens. Each of Saturn's Significant
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and to carry on
its businesses as now conducted and is qualified or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of good standing) in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of
property or the conduct of its businesses as now conducted requires it to
qualify or be licensed, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or licensed has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Saturn Material
Adverse Effect. The Significant Subsidiaries of Saturn are not in
violation, in any material respect, of any of the provisions of their
respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents).

 

 

3.3  Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action.

 

 

(a)  Each of Saturn, Merger Sub1 and Merger Sub 2 have all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement. The execution, delivery and the
performance by Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 of this Agreement and
the consummation by each of them of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Mergers and the Saturn Share Issuance, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Saturn, Merger
Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 and their respective officers, directors and
shareholders (i) except that the Saturn Share Issuance and the consummation
of the Saturn Merger is subject to the receipt of the Saturn Shareholder
Approval, and (ii) other than the approval of this Agreement by Saturn as the
sole shareholder of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of Mercury set forth in Section 4.18,
except for the Saturn Shareholder Approval that is necessary for the Saturn
Share Issuance and Saturn Merger, approval of this Agreement by Saturn as the
sole shareholder of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, and the filing and
recording of the Certificates of Merger under the provisions of the NJBCA, no
other corporate action on the part of Saturn, its officers, directors or
shareholders is necessary to authorize the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Saturn, Merger Sub 1
and Merger Sub 2 and constitutes (assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Mercury) the valid and binding obligation of Saturn, Merger
Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or in law)
(the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

 

 

(b)  The Saturn Board, at a meeting duly called and held prior to execution
of this Agreement, unanimously (i) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Mergers and the Saturn Share
Issuance, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of Saturn and its
shareholders, (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of the Saturn
Common Stock grant the Saturn Shareholder Approval and (iv) directed that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Mergers and the Saturn Share Issuance be submitted to the holders of the
Saturn Common Stock for their approval at a meeting duly called and held for
such purpose.

 

 

(c)  The only vote of holders of Saturn capital stock necessary to approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is the

13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as required by Rules 13a-15(a)
and 15d-15(a) of the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that all

Subsidiaries in all material respects, and (B) were prepared in conformity

time of filing, and together with all information incorporated by reference
therein and schedules and exhibits thereto, the "Mercury SEC Reports"). No
Subsidiary of Mercury is required to file with or furnish to the SEC any

or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date

13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as required by Rules 13a-15(a)
and 15d-15(a) of the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by Mercury in the reports it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is made known to the chief executive officer
and the chief financial officer of Mercury by others within Mercury to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure as required under the Exchange
Act and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Mercury has evaluated the
effectiveness of Mercury's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the

Report that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto,
its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and

deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of its
internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Mercury's ability to record, process, summarize

Form 10-K and the other financial statements included in the Mercury SEC
Reports (including in each case any related notes and schedules) fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Mercury and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates set forth therein
and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for the periods set forth therein, and in each case (A) were prepared
from, and in accordance with, the books and records of Mercury and its
Subsidiaries in all material respects, and (B) were prepared in conformity
with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved (except as
otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto and subject, in the case of

or its Subsidiaries (or described in the notes thereto), other than (i)

since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither Mercury nor any of its
Affiliates has made, arranged, modified (in any material way), or forgiven
personal loans to any executive officer or director of Mercury.

Knowledge is any other party, in breach, default or violation (and no event
has occurred or not occurred through Mercury's or any of its Subsidiaries'
action or inaction or, to Mercury's Knowledge, through the action or inaction
of any third party, that with notice or the lapse of time or both would
constitute a breach, default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of any Mercury Material Contract to which Mercury or any of its
Subsidiaries is now a party, or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except for breaches, defaults

the Mercury Disclosure Letter, the execution of this Agreement and
performance of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)

or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with
respect to any employee, (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any
restrictions or limitations on the right of Saturn or Mercury to amend or

or has been at any time an "interested stockholder" (as such term is defined
in Section 14A: 10A-3 of the NJBCA) of Saturn.

 

 

4.19  Rights Agreement; Takeover Statutes. Mercury has no "rights plan,"
"rights agreement" or "poison pill" in effect. The Mercury Board has taken
all actions so that no Takeover Statute will apply to (a) Saturn or (b)

and the consummation of the Mercury Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No anti-takeover provision contained in

executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of March 8, 2009 among
Mercury, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such agreement
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Commitment
Letter"), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof
each of the parties thereto (other than Mercury), have severally agreed and
committed to provide the debt financing set forth therein (the "Financing").
The Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived (except as contemplated thereby) prior to the date of this Agreement
and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not
been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of
this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter
is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Mercury and, to the Knowledge of Mercury, the other
parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There are
no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter and assuming the accuracy
in all material respects of Saturn's representations and warranties with
respect to Saturn and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in Article III of
this Agreement, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing, together
with other financial resources of Mercury including cash on hand, the
Repayment Amount, and marketable securities of Mercury on the Closing Date,
will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Mercury
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of any amounts
required to be paid pursuant to Article I and Article II, and the payment of
any debt required to be repaid in connection with the Mergers and of all fees
and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection herewith. As of
the date of this Agreement, (a) (assuming the accuracy in all material
respects of Saturn's representations and warranties contained in Section 3.7
hereof), no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default), in each case, on the part of Mercury under the Commitment Letter
or, to the Knowledge of Mercury, any other party to the Commitment Letter and
(b) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Sections 7.1
and 7.2 hereof, Mercury does not have Knowledge that the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing or any other funds
necessary for the satisfaction of all of Mercury's obligations under this
Agreement and the payment of any debt required to be repaid in connection
with the Mergers and of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection herewith will not be available to Mercury or
the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date. Mercury
has fully paid all fees required to be paid prior to the date of this
Agreement pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

(financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Mercury hereby disclaims any such
other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, neither Mercury nor any other Person makes or has made

2 or any Person has made or is making any representations or warranties
relating to Saturn, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or their respective
Subsidiaries whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by
Saturn, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 in Article III hereof, including any
implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

 

6.1  Preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement.

 

 

(a)  As promptly as is reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Saturn and Mercury shall cooperate in preparing, and prepare, (i)
a joint proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement") in order to seek the Saturn
Shareholder Approval and the Mercury Shareholder Approval and (ii) a
registration statement on Form S-4, which Saturn shall file with the SEC
(together with all amendments thereto, the "Registration Statement"), and in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. The
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other
applicable Law. Each of Saturn and Mercury also agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits
and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of Saturn and Mercury will use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement become effective and the Joint Proxy Statement cleared
by the SEC as promptly as is practicable after such filing and keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the
Mergers, and each of Saturn and Mercury shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders
of Saturn Common Stock and the holders of Mercury Common Stock as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective and
the Joint Proxy Statement shall have been cleared by the SEC. Saturn shall
also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation Common Stock in the Mergers and Mercury shall furnish
all information concerning Mercury and the Mercury shareholders as may be
reasonably requested by Saturn in connection with any such action.

 

 

(b)  No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement
will be made by Saturn, and no filing of or amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement will made by Mercury or Saturn, in each case without
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. Saturn and Mercury each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the
time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if
any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at
the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Saturn Shareholder
Meeting or the Mercury Shareholder Meeting, as the case may be, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. If at any time prior to the Subsequent Effective Time, any
information relating to Saturn or Mercury, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Saturn or Mercury
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of each of Saturn and Mercury. The parties
shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC
or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or for additional information and shall supply each
other with (i) copies of all correspondence and a description of all material
oral discussions between it or any of its respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the
Mergers and (ii) copies of all orders of the SEC relating to the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement.

Mercury and any direct or indirect subsidiary of Mercury) of Saturn Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. Saturn shall use all reasonable best efforts to solicit from
shareholders of Saturn votes in favor of the Saturn Shareholder Approval. The
Saturn Board shall not effect a Change in the Saturn Recommendation, except

Change in the Saturn Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, this Agreement shall be submitted to
the shareholders of Saturn at the Saturn Shareholder Meeting and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Saturn of such obligation. In
addition to the foregoing, Saturn shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Mergers.

of its Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
confidentiality agreement, dated January 15, 2009, previously executed by
Saturn and Mercury (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No party shall be
required to provide access to or disclose any information where such access
or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of such party or
any Subsidiary of such party or contravene any Contract, Law or Order (it

(b)  Exceptions after Receipt of Certain Proposals.

 

 

(i)  Notwithstanding anything that may be to the contrary herein, at any
time prior to obtaining the Saturn Shareholder Approval (and in no event
after obtaining the Saturn Shareholder Approval), the Saturn Board, directly
or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may, subject
to compliance with Section 6.4(c)(i), (A) if there has been no material
breach or failure to comply with Section 6.4(a)(i), engage in negotiations or
discussions with any third party that the Saturn Board determines in good
faith is credible and reasonably capable of consummating a Superior Proposal
for Saturn, and that has made after the date of this Agreement a Superior
Proposal for Saturn or a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for Saturn
that the Saturn Board determines in good faith (after considering the advice
of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel) could reasonably lead to the receipt of a Superior Proposal for
Saturn, (B) thereafter, furnish to such third party nonpublic information
relating to Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less materially favorable to Saturn than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which contains a "standstill"
or similar provision on terms no more materially favorable to such third
party than the terms of any "standstill" or similar agreement, or provision
in any agreement, applicable to Mercury with respect to Saturn; provided,
that the terms of such "standstill" or similar provision may allow such third
party to make Acquisition Proposals to Saturn in connection with the
negotiations or discussions permitted by this Section 6.4(b)(1) (a copy of
such confidentiality agreement shall, subject to Section 6.4(c)(i), be
provided, promptly after its execution, and which copy and the terms and
existence thereof shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations imposed
on Mercury pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement), provided,
that, subject to Section 6.4(c)(i), all such nonpublic information (to the
extent that such nonpublic information has not been previously provided or
made available to Mercury) is provided or made available to Mercury, as the
case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided or made available to such third party, and provided, further, that,
if such Superior Proposal for Saturn or Acquisition Proposal for Saturn is
made by a third party who or which, on the date hereof, is party to a
confidentiality agreement with Saturn which would prohibit Saturn from
complying with any of the terms of this Section 6.4(b)(i) or Section
6.4(c)(i) requiring the provision by Saturn of information, agreements or the
documents to Mercury, then Saturn may take the actions described in clauses
(A) and (B) of this Section 6.4(b)(i) only if such confidentiality agreement
with such third party has been amended to (x) allow Saturn to fully comply
with such terms of this Section 6.4(b)(i) and Section 6.4(c)(i) without
violating such confidentiality agreement and (y) include, if not already
included, a "standstill" or similar provision on terms no more materially
favorable to such third party than the terms of any "standstill" or similar
agreement, or provision in any agreement, applicable to Mercury with respect
to Saturn; provided, that the terms of such "standstill" or similar provision
may allow such third party to make Acquisition Proposals to Saturn in
connection with the negotiations or discussions permitted by this Section
6.4, (C) in response to an Acquisition Proposal for Saturn received by Saturn
after the date of this Agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal for
Saturn or in response to an Intervening Event, and subject to compliance with
Section 6.4(d)(i), make a Change in the Saturn Recommendation, and (D)
subject to compliance with Section 6.4(d)(i), in response to an Acquisition
Proposal which the Saturn Board determines in good faith, after considering
advice from outside legal counsel to Saturn and Saturn's financial advisor,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(f) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (A) through
(D) only if the Saturn Board determines in good faith, after considering
advice from outside legal counsel to Saturn, that its failure to take such
action would likely constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

 

(ii)  Notwithstanding anything that may be to the contrary herein, at any
time prior to obtaining the Mercury Shareholder Approval (and in no event
after obtaining the Mercury Shareholder Approval), the Mercury Board,
directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may,
subject to compliance with Section 6.4(c)(ii), (A) if there has been no
material breach or failure to comply with Section 6.4(a)(ii), engage in
negotiations or discussions with any third party that the Mercury Board
determines in good faith is credible and reasonably capable of consummating a
Superior Proposal for Mercury, and that has made after the date of this
Agreement a Superior Proposal for Mercury or a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal for Mercury that the Mercury Board determines in good faith (after
considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) could reasonably lead to the receipt of
a Superior Proposal for Mercury, (B) thereafter, furnish to such third party
nonpublic information relating to Mercury or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less materially favorable to
Mercury than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
which contains a "standstill" or similar provision on terms no more
materially favorable to such third party than the terms of any "standstill"
or similar agreement, or provision in any agreement, applicable to Saturn
with respect to Mercury; provided, that the terms of such "standstill" or
similar provision may allow such third party to make Acquisition Proposals to
Mercury in connection with the negotiations or discussions permitted by this
Section 6.4(b)(ii) (a copy of such confidentiality agreement shall, subject
to Section 6.4(c)(ii), be provided, promptly after its execution, and which
copy and the terms and existence thereof shall be subject to the
confidentiality obligations imposed on Mercury pursuant to
the Confidentiality Agreement), provided, that, subject to Section
6.4(c)(ii), all such nonpublic information (to the extent that such nonpublic
information has not been previously provided or made available to Saturn) is
provided or made available to Saturn, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such third party), and provided, further, that, if such Superior Proposal for
Mercury or Acquisition Proposal for Mercury is made by a third party who or
which, on the date hereof, is party to a confidentiality agreement with
Mercury which would prohibit Mercury from complying with any of the terms of
this Section 6.4(b)(ii) or Section 6.4(c)(ii) requiring the provision by
Mercury of information, agreements or the documents to Saturn, then Saturn
may take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) of this Section
6.4(b)(ii) only if such confidentiality agreement with such third party has
been amended to (x) allow Mercury to fully comply with such terms of
this Section 6.4(b)(ii) and Section 6.4(c)(ii) without violating such
confidentiality agreement and (y) include, if not already included, a
"standstill" or similar provision on terms no more materially favorable to
such third party than the terms of any "standstill" or similar agreement, or
provision in any agreement applicable to Saturn with respect to Mercury;
provided, that the terms of such "standstill" or similar provision may allow
such third party to make Acquisition Proposals to Mercury in connection with
the negotiations or discussions permitted by this Section 6.4 and (C) in
response to an Acquisition Proposal for Mercury received by Mercury after the
date of this Agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal for Mercury or in
response to an Intervening Event, and subject to compliance with Section
6.4(d)(ii), make a Change in the Mercury Recommendation, but in each case
referred to in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C) only if the Mercury
Board determines in good faith, after considering advice from outside legal
counsel to Mercury, that its failure to take such action would likely
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

party and the FTC, the DOJ, the EC or any other Governmental Entity and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any communication
relating to the antitrust merits, any potential remedies, commitments or
undertakings, the timing of any waivers, consents, approvals, Permits, Orders
or authorizations (including the expiration or termination of any waiting
periods), or any agreement regarding the timing of consummation of the
Mergers), (v) subject to applicable Law, discuss with and permit the
other party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the other party's reasonable comments in connection with, any proposed
filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ, the EC or any other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party to any other
Person, relating to any Antitrust Law or any investigation or other
Proceeding pursuant to any Antitrust Law in connection with the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (vi) not participate
or agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or
discussion (including, without limitation, any meeting, telephone call or
discussion relating to the antitrust merits, any potential remedies,
commitments or undertakings, the timing of any waivers, consents, approvals,
Permits, Orders or authorizations (including the expiration or termination of
any waiting periods), and any agreement regarding the timing of consummation
of the Mergers) with the FTC, the DOJ, the EC or any other Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry relating to any
Antitrust Law or any investigation or other Proceeding pursuant to any
Antitrust Law in connection with this Agreement or the Mergers unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting, telephone call or discussion, (vii) furnish
the other party promptly with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications relating to any Antitrust Law or any investigation or
other Proceeding pursuant to any Antitrust Law between them and their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and the FTC,
the DOJ, the EC or any other Governmental Entity or members of their
respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Mergers and (viii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other
party in connection with any such registrations, declarations and filings and
in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such
agency or other Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law with respect to any such registration, declaration and filing or any such
transaction. Mercury and Saturn may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 6.5(b) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Mercury or Saturn, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5(b), materials provided to the
other party or its outside counsel may be redacted to remove references
concerning the valuation of Saturn and its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(c)  Nothing in this Agreement shall require Mercury or any of its
Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action that would result in, or be
reasonably likely to result in, any Burdensome Condition. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Burdensome Condition" shall mean making proposals,
offering remedies, commitments or undertakings, executing or carrying out
agreements (including consent decrees) or submitting to Laws or Orders (i)
providing for the license, sale, divestiture or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of trust or otherwise) of any capital
stock or other Equity Interests of a Subsidiary of Saturn or Mercury,
business, assets, categories of assets, or products of Mercury, Saturn or
their respective Subsidiaries or the holding separate of the capital stock or
other Equity Interests of a Subsidiary of Saturn or Mercury or (ii) otherwise
imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on Mercury, Saturn or any of
their respective Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or their
ability to retain, any of the businesses, assets, categories of assets,
or products of Mercury, Saturn, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (any matter referenced in the foregoing
clause (i) or (ii) being a "Regulatory Divestiture") that, in the case of
clause (i) and/or (ii), individually or in the aggregate would result in, or
be reasonably likely to result in, in the one year loss of net sales revenues
(as measured by 2008 net sales revenues) in excess of $1,000,000,000, but
excluding any loss of net sales revenues related to the license, sale,
divestiture or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of trust or otherwise) of any capital stock or other Equity
Interests or any business, assets, categories of assets, or products listed
in Section 6.5(c) of the Mercury Disclosure Letter. For purposes of
calculating the loss of net sales revenue in the preceding sentence, (x) the
least amount of lost revenues (as measured by 2008 net sales revenue) as may
be required to obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals, permits,
Orders or authorizations from any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to
avoid entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order, shall be used in
the event that Mercury elects to offer any license, sale, divestiture or
other disposition, holding separate, or limitation on freedom of action that
would result in a higher loss of net sales revenue (as measured by net 2008
sales revenue) than reasonably required to achieve such result and (y) lost
net sales revenue attributable to the license, sale, divestiture or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of trust or
otherwise) of any capital stock or other Equity Interests( or any business,
assets, categories of assets, or products, as applicable) of an entity the
financial results of which were reported on the consolidated financial
statements of Mercury or Saturn included in the Mercury Form 10-K or the
Saturn Form 10-K, as the case may be, using the equity method of accounting
shall be calculated by (1) multiplying the net 2008 sales revenue of such
entity (or of such business, assets, categories of assets or products of such
entity, as applicable), by (2) the percentage of the total
outstanding capital stock or other Equity Interests of such entity to be
licensed, sold, divested or otherwise disposed or held separate by Mercury or
Saturn or any of their respective Subsidiary, as the case may be (or in the
case of the license, sale, divestiture or other disposition or holding
separate of any business, assets, categories of assets or products, as
applicable, of such entity, the percentage of the total outstanding capital
stock or other Equity Interests of such entity to be held by Mercury or
Saturn or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be). Saturn
agrees that it (A) shall not publicly, or before any Governmental Entity or
third party, offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall not commit to,
or enter into, consent to or acquiesce to any Regulatory Divestiture without
the prior written consent of Mercury, which may be withheld in the sole
discretion of Mercury and (B) shall commit to, enter into, consent to or
acquiesce to any Regulatory Divestitures as directed by Mercury.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, neither Mercury nor
Saturn shall be required by this Section 6.5 to commit to, enter into,
consent to, or acquiesce to any Regulatory Divestiture that is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers.

 

 

6.6  Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the earlier to occur of (a) the Closing Date and (b) the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, each of Saturn and Mercury shall
promptly notify the other party of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of
any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of
the other party to effect the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure of Saturn or
Mercury, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition
to the obligations of the other party to effect the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall
not cure the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, the failure to
comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

 

 

6.7  Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release
mutually agreed upon by Mercury and Saturn. Thereafter, Mercury and Saturn
shall consult with and obtain the approval of the other party (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before issuing any other press
release or other public announcement with respect to the Mergers or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such other press release prior to
such consultation and approval, except as may be required by applicable Law
or any listing agreement related to the trading of the shares of either party
on any securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable best
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such
press release or making any such public announcement; provided, however, that
each of Mercury and Saturn may make any public statement in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any
such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Mercury and Saturn and do
not reveal material, nonpublic information regarding the other party.

 

 

6.8  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

 

 

(a)  From and after the Subsequent Effective Time, the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in
respect of each of the foregoing), in the same manner as provided by Saturn
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, each present and former
director, officer and employee of Saturn and its Subsidiaries (in all of
their capacities) and all fiduciaries under any Saturn Plan, including any
person who becomes a director, officer or employee or fiduciary under any
Saturn Plan prior to the Subsequent Effective Time (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director,
officer, employee or fiduciary of Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries or a
fiduciary under any Saturn Plan or is or was serving at the request of Saturn
or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of any other
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other business or non-profit enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Subsequent
Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions by directors or
officers of Saturn or its Subsidiaries in their capacities as such arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and shall
provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified Parties, in all such cases
to the same extent that such persons are indemnified or have the right to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Saturn pursuant
to Saturn's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification
agreements, if any, or by any one of Saturn's Subsidiaries pursuant to such
Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification
agreements of any Subsidiary of Saturn, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

 

(b)  For six (6) years after the Subsequent Effective Time, the Saturn
Merger Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties an insurance and indemnification policy with an insurer
with the same or better credit rating as the current carrier for Saturn that
provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Subsequent
Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") covering each such person covered by the
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy of Saturn on terms with
respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of Saturn's
directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by Saturn for such
coverage; and provided, further, that if any annual premium for such
insurance coverage exceeds 250% of such annual premium, the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable
for a cost not exceeding such amount. Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation's
obligations under this Section 6.8(b) may be satisfied by Mercury, or, with
the approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, of Mercury,
Saturn, purchasing a "tail" policy from an insurer with substantially the
same or better credit rating as the current carrier for Saturn's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of
six (6) years from the Subsequent Effective Time, (ii) covers each person
covered by Saturn's directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect on
the date of this Agreement or at the Subsequent Effective Time for actions
and omissions occurring prior to the Subsequent Effective Time, and (iii)
contains terms that are no less favorable than those of Saturn's directors'
and officers' insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. If
such "tail" policy has been obtained by Saturn prior to the Initial Effective
Time, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(c)  The Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for
six (6) years after the Subsequent Effective Time in the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation's (or any successor's) certificate of incorporation and
bylaws provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the intended
beneficiaries as those contained in the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect as of the Initial
Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of Saturn or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as
in effect immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Proceeding or resolution of such claim.

 

 

(d)  The provisions of this Section 6.8 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. The
Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity obligations provided in this
Section 6.8 unless it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to such indemnity.

 

 

(e)  If the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation, or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

 

 

6.9  Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a)  For a period from and after the Initial Effective Time through December
31, 2010, (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee
who is an employee of Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries at the Initial
Effective Time ("Saturn Employees") (i) annual base salary no less than the
annual base salary as in effect for such Saturn Employee as of the Initial
Effective Time; and (ii) other compensation and employee benefits that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the other compensation and employee
benefits that are provided to Saturn Employees immediately prior to the
Initial Effective Time; provided, however, that (x) for purposes of
determining "other compensation and employee benefits" required to be
provided pursuant to clause (ii) above, change in control or transaction-
based retention, transition, stay or similar bonus arrangements shall be
excluded, (y) so long as the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation complies
with the provisions of Section 6.9(g) as may be applicable to a given Saturn
Employee, Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall be deemed to
have satisfied the portion of the covenant contained in clause (ii) above
with respect to any obligation to provide severance payments and benefits to
such Saturn Employee as may otherwise be required to be provided hereunder,
and (z) so long as the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation complies with the
provisions of Section 6.9(d) and (e), as may be applicable to a given Saturn
Employee, Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall be deemed to have
satisfied the portion of the covenant contained in clause (ii) above with
respect to any obligation to provide short-term incentive compensation
and equity compensation, as applicable, to such Saturn Employee as
may otherwise be required to be provided hereunder for the period during
which Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation has complied with such provisions.
The preceding sentence shall not preclude the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries at any time following the Initial Effective
Time from terminating the employment of any Saturn Employee for any reason
(or for no reason). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, with respect to
Saturn Employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements,
compensation and benefits shall be provided in accordance with the applicable
collective bargaining agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
with respect to any Saturn Employees who became Saturn Employees as a result
of an acquisition by Saturn ("Acquired Saturn Employees") and whose
compensation and benefits have not been fully integrated into Saturn Plans as
of the Initial Effective Time, such Acquired Saturn Employees' compensation
and benefits shall continue to be integrated into the applicable Saturn Plan
following the Initial Effective Time; provided however that at such time as
the integration is complete, such Acquired Saturn Employee's compensation and
benefits shall be continued as described in the first sentence of this
Section 6.9(a). From and after the Initial Effective Time, the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation shall honor all Saturn Plans, Saturn Employment
Agreements and Saturn Foreign Plans and compensation arrangements and
agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
Initial Effective Time, including without limitation the Shining Performance
Program.

 

 

(b)  Each Saturn Employee employed in the United States (a "US Employee")
whose employment is terminated during the Benefits Continuation Period
under circumstances entitling the US Employee to severance benefits under
the applicable plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement providing
severance benefits to such US Employee will receive additional age and
service credit under the qualified and non-qualified pension and retirement
plans and post-retirement health and welfare plans as if such US Employee had
remained employed through the Benefits Continuation Period for purposes of
determining whether the US Employee has achieved the following age or number
of years of service, as applicable, for the following purposes (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual): (u) Age 50: eligibility for post-retirement
health coverage; (v) Age 55: portability and continued company paid premiums
for retiree life insurance (the "Life Insurance Benefit"), subject to
achievement of 5 years of service; (w) Age 60: the 35 percent minimum benefit
under the supplemental executive retirement plan (the "SERP
Minimum Benefit"), subject to achievement of 10 years of service, and
elimination of the reduction for early retirement under the qualified pension
plan (the "Qualified Plan Benefit"), subject to achievement of 40 years of
service; (x) 5 years of Service: the Life Insurance Benefit, subject to
attainment of age 55, and vesting in the qualified pension plan; (y) 10 years
of service: the SERP Minimum Benefit, subject to attainment of age 60; and
(z) 40 years of Service: the Qualified Plan Benefit, subject to attainment of
age 60. Saturn may amend the qualified and non-qualified pension and
retirement plans and post-retirement health and welfare plans in which US
Employees participate to reflect and effectuate the foregoing. Such
additional age and service credit shall not be provided for purposes of
determining pension benefits for any US Employee who actually receives
additional age and service credit with respect to such pension benefits under
a Saturn Employment Agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment
under such agreement, other than the two executives identified on Section
6.9(b) of the Saturn Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(c)  Each Saturn Employee who is a "Chief Financial Officer" or "General
Manager" of an entity based outside of the United States whose employment is
terminated during the two-year period commencing on the Initial Effective
Time under circumstances entitling such Saturn Employee to severance benefits
under such applicable plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement
providing severance benefits to such Saturn Employee as of the date hereof
shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement, be entitled to a minimum cash severance
benefit of two times the sum of such Saturn Employee's target annual bonus
and base salary. Saturn may enter into amendments of such plans, programs,
policies, agreements or arrangements to effectuate the foregoing. For the
avoidance of any doubt, all cash severance benefits payable under such
applicable plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, including but not
limited to any statutory termination benefits provided pursuant to Law in the
applicable local jurisdiction, shall be counted as part of the determination
of whether the minimum cash severance benefit of two times the sum of such
Saturn Employee's target annual bonus and base salary has been satisfied.

 

 

(d)  Saturn may set and pay short-term incentive bonuses in the ordinary
course of business consistent in all material respects with past practice,
provided that, with respect to performance year 2009, (i) if the Initial
Effective Time occurs after the end of any short-term performance period and
prior to the time that short-term incentive bonuses for such period would be
paid in the ordinary course of business consistent in all material respects
with past practice, Saturn shall pay, immediately prior to the Initial
Effective Time, to each person who is a participant in a short-term incentive
program immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time (a "Bonus
Plan Participant") a bonus with respect to such performance period based
on actual performance for the performance period, provided to the extent
that actual results are not yet available for such period or any portion
thereof, such bonus shall be based on actual performance for the period for
which such results are available and a good faith estimate of actual
performance for the remainder of such period and (ii) if the Initial
Effective Time occurs during the 2009 calendar year, Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation will pay a full year bonus to each Bonus Plan Participant who is
an employee of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation as of December 31, 2009
based on performance measured through the latest date prior to the Initial
Effective Time through which performance against metrics established by
Saturn prior to the date hereof can be measured as of the Initial Effective
Time, such bonus to be paid no later than March 15, 2010; provided, however
that each Bonus Plan Participants whose employment terminates during 2009 and
who satisfies the eligibility requirements to receive separation pay under
the separation benefits plan applicable to him or her (including, where
applicable, signing a valid release of claims) shall receive a pro rata
portion of his/her 2009 target bonus based on the number of full days such
Bonus Plan Participant was employed by Saturn or Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries in 2009. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall adversely affect the right of any participant
in a short-term incentive bonus program to receive short term incentive bonus
payments upon a termination of employment under the terms of the applicable
short-term incentive bonus program.

 

 

(e)  In the event that the Initial Effective Time occurs on or after January
1, 2010, each Bonus Plan Participant shall be paid, at the same time as
bonuses are paid for performance year 2010 to Saturn Employees under the plan
of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation, a pro rata portion of his/her
2010 target bonus based on the number of days such Bonus Plan Participant was
employed by Saturn or its Subsidiaries in 2010 through the Initial Effective
Time. Beginning January 1, 2010 or if the Initial Effective Time occurs on or
after January 1, 2010, beginning immediately following the Initial Effective
Time, Saturn Employees shall be eligible to participate in any short-term
incentive award plans of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to the same extent and on the same terms and conditions as
similarly situated employees of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries who were not Saturn Employees, provided that, in addition to
the amounts described in the first sentence of this Section 6.9(e), the
amount of the 2010 bonus payable to such Saturn Employees in respect of the
portion of 2010 occurring after the Initial Effective Time under the short
term incentive award plans of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries shall be pro-rated for the portion of 2010 occurring after the
Initial Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
performance year 2010, Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation will pay a pro
rata portion of the target bonus for performance year 2010 to participants
who were Saturn Employees as of the Initial Effective Time whose employment
terminates during 2010 who satisfy the eligibility requirements to receive
separation pay under the separation benefits plan applicable to them
(including, where applicable, signing a valid release of claims) which pro
rata portion shall be based on the number of days the Saturn Employee was
employed by Saturn or Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries in 2010. Beginning January 1, 2010, Saturn Employees shall be
eligible to participate in any equity compensation plans of the Saturn merger
Surviving Corporation to the same extent and on the same terms and conditions
as similarly situated employees of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries (or of Mercury and its Subsidiaries to the extent that
awards are granted in 2010 prior to the Initial Effective Time) who were not
Saturn Employees, provided, that in the event that the Initial Effective Time
occurs after the date on which equity compensation grants are made to
employees of Mercury generally, Saturn Employees shall nonetheless receive a
grant of equity compensation awards in 2010 from Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation as soon as practicable following the Initial Effective Time to
the same extent and on the same terms and conditions as similarly situated
employees of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries who
were not Saturn Employees.

 

 

(f)  Following the Initial Effective Time, the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation shall treat former employees of Saturn and its Subsidiaries who,
as of the Initial Effective Time, are eligible to receive post-retirement
health benefits under the applicable Saturn Plans, no less favorably than
similarly situated former employees of the Saturn Merger Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries who are not Saturn Employees with respect to
post-retirement health benefits.

 

 

(g)  For the period required under the terms of Saturn's Severance Benefit
Plan (the "Saturn Severance Plan"), but in no event for shorter than the
Benefits Continuation Period, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall
(i) maintain the Saturn Severance Plan for the purpose of providing any
severance payments to Saturn Employees and (ii) provide the severance
payments and benefits required thereunder in accordance with the terms of the
Saturn Severance Plan to any Saturn Employee who is a participant in the
Saturn Severance Plan immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time whose
employment is terminated during the Benefits Continuation Period.

 

 

(h)  Prior to the Initial Effective Time, Saturn may establish a retention
bonus pool not to exceed 90 million dollars to provide cash retention
arrangements equal to no more than one times the sum of the applicable Saturn
Employee's base pay and target bonus to certain Saturn Employees other than
(i) Saturn Employees with a Saturn Employment Agreements providing severance
pay of at least two times the sum of base pay and target bonus, (ii) Saturn
Employees employed outside the U.S. who are eligible to receive guaranteed
minimum severance in accordance with Section 6.9(c), and (iii) Saturn
Employees who are otherwise eligible for separation pay equal to at least two
times the sum of base pay and target bonus under the Saturn Severance Plan;
provided, however, that Saturn may provide to the Saturn Employees described
in clauses (i) and (iii) above, a cash retention arrangement of up to their
annual target bonus not to exceed 100% of base pay. The terms of the
retention arrangements provided to Saturn Employees under this paragraph
shall provide that no retention bonuses will be paid to such Saturn Employees
whose employment terminates for any reason prior to the six (6) month
anniversary of the Initial Effective Time other than due to termination by
the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation other than for cause.

 

 

(i)  Mercury and the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation hereby agree to the
matter set forth on Section 6.9(i) of the Saturn Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(j)  For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate, and benefit accrual) under the Mercury Plans providing benefits
to any Saturn Employees after the Initial Effective Time or any plan adopted
by the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries after
the Initial Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Saturn Employee shall,
subject to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his or her years of service with Saturn and its Subsidiaries
and their respective predecessors before the Initial Effective Time, to the
same extent as such Saturn Employee was entitled, before the Initial
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit
plan of Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Saturn Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Initial
Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits; and provided,
further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to retiree health
benefit plans applicable to US-based employees, service credit before age 40
will not be recognized for any Saturn Employee who was either hired or
rehired by Saturn or its Subsidiaries on or after January 1, 2003 or had not
attained age 50 before January 1, 2003. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and to the extent permissible by any insurance
carrier or vendor applicable to the New Plan, (i) to the extent a Saturn
Employee becomes eligible to participate in a New Plan, such Saturn Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to the Saturn Plan or Saturn Foreign Plan in which such Saturn
Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Mergers
(such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) (x) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to
any Saturn Employee, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation shall cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such Saturn Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under Old Plan
of Saturn or its Subsidiaries in which such Saturn Employee participated
immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time, and (y) the Saturn Merger
Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Saturn Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

 

(k)  Prior to the Closing, the Saturn Board, or an appropriate committee of
non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the
interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or
director of Saturn or acquisition by any person who becomes an officer or
director of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation as of the Initial
Effective Time, in each case, who is a covered person of Saturn or will be a
covered person of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation for purposes of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
("Section 16") of shares of Saturn Common Stock, Saturn Options or other
equity awards of Saturn or shares of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation
Common Stock, Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation options or other equity
awards of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation, as applicable, pursuant to, or
in connection with, this Agreement and the Mergers shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16. Prior to the Closing, the Mercury
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall

transaction for purposes of Section 16.

 

 

(l)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Saturn Plan or Mercury Plan, or shall
limit the right of the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or Mercury to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Saturn Plan or Mercury Plan
following the Effective Time. If (i) a Person other than the parties hereto
makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this
Agreement as an amendment to any Saturn Plan or Mercury Plan, and (ii) such
provision is deemed to be an amendment to such Saturn Plan or Mercury Plan
even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then, solely
with respect to such Saturn Plan or Mercury Plan, such provision shall lapse
retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect with respect thereto.

 

 

(m)  The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 6.9 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including any
employees or former employees of Saturn or its Subsidiaries, any participant
in any Mercury Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to
continued employment with the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation or any of
its Affiliates.

 

 

(n)  With respect to any Saturn Employees based outside of the United
States, the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation's obligations under this
Section 6.9 shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with
applicable Laws of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof
in which such Saturn Employees are based.

 

 

(o)  Saturn agrees to consult in good faith with Mercury regarding material
communications to Saturn Employees that describe the impact of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement on Saturn
Plans and the Employment Agreements.

 

 

6.10  Financing.

 

 

(a)  Mercury shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions (including
the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Commitment Letter (any such
agreements the "Financing Definitive Agreements"), and execute and deliver to
Saturn a copy thereof as promptly as practicable (and no later than one (1)
Business Day) after such execution, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Financing in the Commitment Letter or the
Financing Definitive Agreements that are within the control of Mercury and
comply with its obligations thereunder, (iv) consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing; provided, that under no circumstances shall Mercury or
any of its Subsidiaries be required to issue, or permit Saturn or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, any equity or debt securities, incur, or permit Saturn
or any of its Subsidiaries to incur, Indebtedness (other than pursuant to the
Financing) or sell, dispose or otherwise transfer, or permit Saturn or any of
its Subsidiaries to sell, dispose or otherwise transfer, any assets in order
to satisfy any conditions in the Commitment Letter or in order to arrange or
obtain any Financing and (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter
or the Financing Definitive Agreements in the event of a breach by the
financing sources that impedes or delays the Closing, including seeking
specific performance of the parties thereunder. In the event that all
conditions to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Definitive Agreements
have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, Mercury shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing
such Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including by taking enforcement action, including seeking specific
performance, to cause such lenders and the other Persons providing such
Financing to fund such Financing). Mercury shall have the right from time to
time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its
rights under, the Commitment Letter or the Financing Definitive Agreements
and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of
the Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources; provided,
that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter or the Financing Definitive
Agreements that amends the Financing and/or substitution of all or any
portion of the Financing shall not (A) expand upon the conditions precedent
or contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set
forth in the Commitment Letter or the Financing Definitive Agreements or (B)
prevent or impede or materially delay the consummation of the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Mercury shall be permitted
to reduce the amount of Financing under the Commitment Letter or the
Financing Definitive Agreements in its reasonable discretion; provided,
that Mercury shall not reduce the Financing to an amount committed below the
amount that is required, together with the Repayment Amount and the financial
resources of Mercury, including cash on hand and marketable securities, to
consummate the Mergers; and provided, further, that such reduction shall not
(x) expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on
the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or
the Financing Definitive Agreements or (y) prevent or materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable or Mercury becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes
any portion of the Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms and
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Commitment
Letter or the Financing Definitive Agreements and such portion is reasonably
required to fund the aggregate Cash Consideration, Mercury shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from
the same and/or alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon terms
and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Mercury or
the Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation than those in the Commitment Letter
or the Financing Definitive Agreements as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event. Mercury shall give Saturn prompt oral
and written notice (but in any event not later than one (1) Business Day
after the occurrence) of any material breach by any party to the Commitment
Letter or the Financing Definitive Agreements or of any condition not likely
to be satisfied, in each case, of which Mercury has Knowledge, any
termination of the Commitment Letter or the Financing Definitive Agreements.
Mercury shall keep Saturn informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of its efforts to consummate the Financing. For the avoidance of
doubt, the syndication of the Financing to the extent permitted by the
Commitment Letter shall not be deemed to violate Mercury\'s obligations under
this Agreement.

 

 

(b)  Saturn shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their respective
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Mercury in connection with the
Financing or any alternate debt financing or debt securities issuance in
connection with the financing of the Mergers (collectively the
"Financing Arrangements") (provided, that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Saturn and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) providing financial and other information
relating to Saturn and its Subsidiaries to Mercury and the lenders and other
financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the
Financing Arrangements and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or
placement agents in connection with the Financing Arrangements (the
"Financing Parties") that is customary for such financing or reasonably
necessary for the completion of the Financing by the Financing Parties,
including information regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of Saturn and its Subsidiaries that is customary
for such financing or reasonably necessary for the completion of the
Financing by the Financing Parties, (ii) participating and causing senior

agencies as are reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing by
the Financing Parties, (iii) assisting in the preparation of (A) any
customary offering documents, bank information memoranda, Forms 8-K,
registration statements, prospectuses and similar documents (including all
historical and pro forma financial statements and information regarding
Saturn and its Subsidiaries that is required by Regulations S-K and S-X to be
included or incorporated by reference in a registration statement) for any of
the Financing Arrangements or offering of debt securities in
connection therewith, and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the Financing Arrangements
(including consenting to the use of Saturn's and its Subsidiaries' logos;
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Saturn or its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries), (v) assisting
in the preparation of and executing and delivering (or using reasonable best
efforts to obtain from its advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute
and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors), (A)
credit agreements and other loan documents, underwriting or note purchase
agreements, indentures, currency or interest hedging agreements and other
contracts in connection with any of the Financing Arrangements (collectively,
the "Financing Documents"), customary certificates (including a certificate
of the principal financial officer of Saturn or any Subsidiary with respect
to solvency matters), legal opinions or other documents and instruments
relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Mercury in connection with any of the Financing
Arrangements and other documents required to be delivered under the Financing
Documents and (B) the amendment of any of Saturn's or its Subsidiaries'
existing credit agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements, or other
agreements, in each case, on terms satisfactory to Mercury and that are
reasonably requested by Mercury in connection with any of the Financing
Arrangements; provided, that no obligation of Saturn or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such agreements or amendments shall be effective until
the Closing and; provided, further, that Saturn may reasonably deny such
request, (vi) using its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have its
independent accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance,
including providing customary comfort letters to the underwriters in
connection with the initial purchase of any securities in connection with any
Financing Arrangements and providing customary consents to inclusion of their
audit reports in registration statements of Mercury or Saturn, (vii) using
its reasonable best efforts to permit any cash and marketable securities of
Saturn and its Subsidiaries to be made available to Mercury at the Closing,
(viii) providing authorization letters to the Financing Parties authorizing
the distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors and
containing a representation to the Financing Parties that the public side
versions of such documents, if any, do not include material nonpublic
information about Saturn or its Affiliates or securities, (ix) using its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Financing Parties benefit from the
existing lending relationships of Saturn and its Subsidiaries,
(x) cooperating reasonably with the Financing Parties' due diligence
investigation of Saturn and its subsidiaries, including due diligence
performed by any Financing Parties and their respective counsel in connection
with any of the Financing Arrangements, to the extent customary and
reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with the business
of Saturn and (xi) at the request of Mercury, use its reasonable best efforts
to file a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to a guarantee by
Saturn of Indebtedness of Mercury which becomes automatically effective which
registers Saturn's issuance or guarantee of the debt securities to be issued
in connection with any Financing Arrangements, which guarantees shall not be
effective prior to and only upon the Closing; provided that in no event
shall Saturn be required to take any actions that would encumber any of its
assets prior to the consummation of the Mergers or that would result in
a breach of any of its Contracts; and provided, further, that until the
Subsequent Effective Time occurs, neither Saturn nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall (x) be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee, (y) have any liability or any obligation under any credit agreement or
any related document or any other agreement or document related to the
Financing (or alternative financing that Mercury may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (z) be required to incur
any other liability in connection with the Financing (or any alternative
financing that Mercury may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) unless reimbursed or reasonably
satisfactorily indemnified by Mercury.

 

 

(c)  Mercury (i) shall promptly, upon request by Saturn, reimburse Saturn
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) to the extent incurred by Saturn, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives in connection with the cooperation of Saturn
and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.10, (ii) acknowledges and
agrees that Saturn, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person
under any of the Financing Arrangements that Mercury may request in

respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with any of the Financing Arrangements or Financing Documents and any
information used in connection therewith, other than with respect to any
information provided by Saturn or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the
event that such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arose out of or
result from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Saturn,
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.

 

 

(d)  In the event that the Commitment Letter is, or the Financing Definitive
Agreements are amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified,
including as a result of obtaining alternative financing in accordance with
Section 6.10(a), or if Mercury substitutes other financing for all or a
portion of the Financing, each of Mercury and Saturn shall comply with its
covenants in Sections 6.10(a) and (b) with respect to the Commitment Letter
or the Financing Definitive Agreements, as so amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified and with respect to such other financing to the same
extent that Mercury and Saturn would have been obligated to comply with

10.11 relating to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Definitive
Agreements and the Financing shall be deemed to refer to the Commitment
Letter or the Financing Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced,

are necessary or advisable so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute,
regulation or provision in Mercury's certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or Saturn's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be on
such transactions.

 

 

6.12  Transaction Litigation. Each of Mercury and Saturn shall cooperate
with the other in the defense or settlement of any litigation relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement against (a) Saturn, any of

Mercury or Saturn to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to

6.14  Overseas Financing. At the Closing, (a) Mercury will cause one or

Mercury in its discretion, the "Repayment Amount"), to Saturn Holdings BV and
Saturn Intl CV and (b) Saturn will cause Saturn Holdings BV and Saturn Intl
CV to pay the Repayment Amount to Saturn and Saturn Sub in satisfaction of
such portion of the Intercompany Notes as equals the amount of such payment
(for these purposes, translating currencies at the spot rate in effect on the
date of such payment); it being understood that, for administrative
convenience, the Mercury Overseas Subsidiaries may advance the Repayment
Amount directly to the Exchange Agent, in which case Saturn, Saturn Sub,
Saturn Holdings BV and Saturn Intl CV will issue appropriate letters
of direction confirming such payments. The lending of the Repayment Amount
from the Mercury Overseas Subsidiaries to Saturn Holdings BV and Saturn Intl
CV shall be evidenced by notes in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Mercury.

reasonable best efforts to and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to cause the
Mercury Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section

action that will cause the retention by Saturn shareholders of a portion of
each share of Saturn Merger Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be taxable.

 

 

6.18  Tax Treatment of Specified Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, Saturn
and Mercury will take such actions or steps as Saturn and Mercury mutually
agree are commercially reasonable and practicable to cause DJT Partners, LP
to be disregarded as an entity separate from Saturn for United States federal
income tax purposes, in which case, at the Initial Effective Time, all shares
of Saturn Common Stock held by DJT Partners, LP shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof; provided that such steps would
not be reasonably likely to (i) impair the ability of Saturn to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect or (ii) prevent or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

to take all actions to achieve Compliance with ISRA with respect to all real
property owned, leased or operated by Mercury or Saturn located in the State
of New Jersey that are considered "industrial establishments" under the New
Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act, N.J.S.A. 13:1K-6 et seq. ("ISRA" and all
such properties, the "New Jersey Properties"), or to obtain a Remediation
Agreement (as such term is defined under ISRA) with respect to all New
Jersey Properties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
of Mercury and Saturn, as the case may be, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to:

effect, any remediation funding source required under ISRA to secure the
performance of ISRA compliance activities. Any such remediation funding
source shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the NJDEP.

 

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Compliance with ISRA" shall mean the
receipt of a letter or letters from the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection (the "NJDEP") or from such third party as is
authorized by NJDEP to issue the same (a "Site Professional") approving a No
Further Action Letter and Covenant Not to Sue (as such terms are defined
under ISRA), or other written determination by the NJDEP or a
Site Professional that (i) that the requirements of ISRA have been satisfied,
(ii) that the requirements of ISRA do not apply or (iii) that compliance with
ISRA has been waived. Such written authorization may include, but not be

into this Agreement. If a party fails to promptly pay the amount due by
it pursuant to this Section 8.3, interest shall accrue on such amount from
the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement until the date of payment at the rate of 6% per annum. If, in
order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results
in judgment for such party for such amount, the defaulting party shall pay
the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit. Each of
the parties further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by Saturn
and Mercury specified in this Section 8.3 is not a penalty, but in each case
is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Mercury
or Saturn, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on
the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
In no event shall Saturn or Mercury, as applicable, be required to pay
the Termination Fee more than once.

applicable Law, each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in
any such claim, action or dispute in such courts by the mailing of such
process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for
notices provided for herein.

 

 

10.10  Disclosure Letters. The statements in the Saturn Disclosure Letter
and the Mercury Disclosure Letter relate to the provisions in the section of
this Agreement to which they expressly relate; provided, however, that
any information set forth in one section of the Saturn Disclosure Letter or
the Mercury Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, shall also be deemed to
apply to each other section to which its relevance is reasonably apparent.
In the Saturn Disclosure Letter and the Mercury Disclosure Letter, (a)
all capitalized terms used but not defined therein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in this Agreement, (b) the section numbers correspond to the
section numbers in this Agreement and (c) inclusion of any item in a
disclosure letter (i) does not represent a determination that such item is
material or establish a standard of materiality, (ii) does not represent a
determination that such item did not arise in the ordinary course of business
and (iii) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any third
party concerning such item.

 

 

10.11  Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or
equity, including monetary damages, except as limited by Section 8.3) to seek
and obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances
where Mercury or Saturn is obligated to consummate the Mergers and the
Mergers have not been consummated (other than as a result of the other
party's refusal to close in violation of this Agreement) each of Saturn and
Mercury expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other party and its
shareholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will
be inadequate to compensate such other party and its shareholders, and that
such other party on behalf of itself and its shareholders shall be entitled
to enforce specifically Mercury's or Saturn's, as the case may be, obligation
to consummate the Mergers. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that neither
Saturn nor Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 shall be entitled to enforce
specifically the obligations of Mercury to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless all of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 shall have been satisfied or waived and the
proceeds of the Financing are then available in full pursuant to the
Commitment Letter (or if Financing Definitive Agreements have been entered
into, pursuant to such Financing Definitive Agreements). Each party further
agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10.11, and each
party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

 

10.12  WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR CONCERNING THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

 

 

10.13  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

 

10.14  Amendment. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended
by the mutual agreement of the parties at any time prior to the Initial
Effective Time only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties.
