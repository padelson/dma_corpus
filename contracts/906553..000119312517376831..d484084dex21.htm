Section 2.03 _Merger Fund; Exchange_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as the

with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and the Partnership.

 

(b) _Deposit of Closing Payment and Selling Partners Representative Expense

On behalf of the Selling Partners, on or prior to the Effective Time, Parent

Selling Partners Representative (" _Selling Partners Representative Account_
") the Selling Partners Representative Expense Amount to be used to pay any
expenses incurred by the Selling Partners Representative in accordance with
the performance of its obligations hereunder on behalf of the Selling
Partners. For U.S. federal income and other applicable Tax purposes, the
Selling Partners Representative Expense Amount shall be treated as having

deposit with the Paying Agent (or such other Person as the Selling Partners
Representative and Parent may agree in the case of Section 2.03(d)) of any
amounts payable under this Agreement, Parent shall have no further obligation
or liability with respect to the payment of such amounts under this Agreement
or the Paying Agent (or similar agreement).

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to

with such changes thereto as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent,
the " _Letter of Transmittal"_ ) and a joinder in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Partnership (the " _Joinder_ "),
and instructions for use of the Letter of Transmittal in effecting the
exchange of the Partnership Interests and for executing the Joinder. Upon
proper completion, execution and delivery by a Selling Partner to the Paying
Agent of a Letter of Transmittal, Joinder and all other documentation required
by the Letter of Transmittal (including the FIRPTA certificate), such Selling
Partner shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for each of its Partnership
Interests, its respective portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the distribution mechanics set forth in the PartnershipÂ’s Limited
Partnership Agreement (the amount payable in respect of each Partnership
Interest, the " _Partnership Interest Distribution Amount_ ").

(d) _Payment of Online Gaming Amount_. On the second (2nd) anniversary of the

Agent (or such other Person as the Selling Partners Representative and Parent

the Disbursement Schedule the Online Gaming Amount. Promptly following its
receipt of the Online Gaming Amount from Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.02(c)_, the Paying Agent (or such other Person) shall distribute the Online
Gaming Amount to the Selling Partners in accordance with the
respective percentages for which the Paying Agent distributed the Merger Fund
to the Selling Partners pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_.

 

(e) _Remaining Amounts_. If any amount deposited with the Paying Agent in the
Merger Fund in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ remains unclaimed
for one (1) year after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to
Parent or its designee automatically, and any Selling Partner who has not
complied with the procedures set forth herein and in the Letter of
Transmittal shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Partnership for
payment of such amount, without interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
the Selling Partners after five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted
by Law, become the property of the Surviving Partnership, free and clear of
any claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.04 _Tax Treatment of Purchase and Sale; Allocation_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, for U.S. federal and applicable state and local
income Tax purposes, the purchase and sale of the Partnership Interests
hereunder shall be treated as a transaction described in Situation 2
of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, pursuant to which (a) the
Partnership shall terminate as a partnership under Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the
Code, (b) the Selling Partners shall be treated as having sold their
respective Partnership Interests in accordance with Section 741 of the Code,
and (c) for purposes of classifying the acquisition by Parent, the Partnership
shall be deemed to make a liquidating distribution of all of its assets to
the Selling Partners, following which Parent shall be treated as having
acquired, by purchase, all of the former PartnershipÂ’s assets (the "
_Purchased Assets_ ") deemed distributed. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing, Parent shall provide the Selling Partners Representative with a
schedule allocating the aggregate consideration paid pursuant to this
Agreement (as adjusted 

 



5  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), together with all other
capitalized costs, among the Purchased Assets (the " _Allocation_ "). The
Allocation shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within fifteen (15) days of the
Selling Partner RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Allocation, the Selling
Partners Representative shall respond to the Allocation in writing, noting
with specificity any allocations to which the Selling Partners Representative
disagrees, and Parent and the Selling Partner Representative shall negotiate
in good faith for a period of fifteen (15) days to resolve any disagreements
with respect to the Allocation. In the event the parties cannot agree on the
Allocation within such fifteen (15)-day period, the dispute shall be resolved
by the Auditor in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.03_, applied _mutatis
mutandis_ to the dispute arising under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_. The parties
further acknowledge and agree that any subsequent payments that may be made to
the Selling Partners pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will have the
effect of increasing the amount that will be allocated among the Purchased
Assets and that such increase will be taken into account in a manner
consistent with the procedures set forth above. Parent, Selling Partners and
their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns (including any IRS Form
8594) consistent with the final Allocation and shall take no position contrary
thereto or inconsistent therewith (including in any audits or examinations by
any Tax Authority or any other Proceeding), unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or unless the other party consents thereto in writing, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent Parent, Selling
Partners or their respective Affiliates from settling any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any Tax Authority based upon or arising out of the
Allocation, and neither Parent nor Selling Partners (or their respective
Affiliates) shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority challenging such Allocation.
Parent and Selling Partners shall reasonably cooperate in the filing of any
forms (including any IRS Form 8594) with respect to such Allocation, including
any amendments to such forms required pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to any adjustment to the aggregate consideration made pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement.

Section 2.05 _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and other amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld under the Code, or any
provision of applicable Law with respect to the making of such payment. For
the avoidance of doubt, if any Selling Partner fails to deliver a properly
completed and executed FIRPTA certificate in connection with the delivery by

determined in ParentÂ’s sole discretion. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority,

(b) If the Selling Partners Representative disagrees in whole or in part with
the calculation of any amounts on the Final Closing Statement, the Selling
Partners Representative shall, within thirty (30) Business Days after their
receipt of the Final Closing Statement, notify Parent of such disagreement in
writing (" _Dispute Notice_ "), setting forth in detail those items that the
Selling Partners Representative disagree and the particulars of such
disagreement. Any items or amounts on the Final Closing Statement not disputed
in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive for
purposes of this Agreement. Parent will provide the Selling Partners
Representative with reasonable access to the PartnershipÂ’s records (including
work papers) not otherwise available to the Selling Partners Representative as
a result of the Transaction, solely related to the Selling Partners
RepresentativeÂ’s review of the Final Closing Statement. If the Dispute Notice
is timely provided, Parent and the Selling Partners Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of ten (10) Business Days (or
such longer period as such parties may mutually agree) to, in good faith,
attempt to resolve any disagreements with respect to the items set forth in

disagreed items, then Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing
Indebtedness, Final Closing Transaction Expenses, Final Closing Cash, Final
Adjustment and/or Final 2017 PA Gaming Reimbursement Amount (as the case may
be) shall be the amounts agreed by the parties. If, at the end of such ten

(ii) determine, as promptly as practicable, whether the remaining disputed
items set forth in the Final Closing Statement were prepared in accordance
with the standards set forth in this Agreement, and (iii) deliver, as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45) days of the end of
such ten (10) Business Day period (or such longer period as the parties may
have mutually agreed), to the Selling Partners Representative and Parent its
determination in writing. The resolution for each remaining disputed item
contained in the AuditorÂ’s 

 



8  determination shall be made subject to the definitions and principles set
forth in this Agreement. The Selling Partners Representative and Parent shall
bear their own expenses in the preparation, review and resolution of the
Final Closing Statement, except that the fees and expenses of the Auditor
shall be paid by the Selling Partners Representative and Parent based on the
actual amount not awarded to Parent or the Selling Partners Representative,
respectively, in relation to the aggregate amount actually contested by Parent
and the Selling Partners Representative. The determination of the Auditor
shall be final, binding and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement, and
Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness, Final Closing
Transaction Expenses, Final Closing Cash, the Final Adjustment and/or Final
2017 PA Gaming Reimbursement Amount (as the case may be) shall be the amounts
determined by the Auditor. The date on which all items and amounts set forth
on the Final Closing Statement are finally determined in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Determination Date_."

(c) If (1) the Final Adjustment _plus_ Final 2017 PA Gaming Reimbursement
Amount, is _less_   _than_ (2) the Estimated Adjustment _plus_ Estimated 2017
PA Gaming Reimbursement Amount (such an amount, " _Purchase Price Reduction_
"), then promptly following the Determination Date (but in any event within
two (2) Business Days thereafter), (i) (x) Parent and the Selling Partners
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to release
an amount equal to the Purchase Price Reduction from the Working Capital
Escrow Account to Parent ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such amount to be
released to Parent from the Working Capital Escrow Account shall not exceed
the Working Capital Escrow Amount) and (y) if the amount of the Purchase Price
Reduction is _greater than_ the Working Capital Escrow Amount (such an
amount, the " _Additional Adjustment Release Amount_ "), Parent and the
Selling Partners Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in
writing to release an amount equal to the Additional Adjustment Release
Amount from the Escrow Account to Parent , (ii) the funds remaining (if any)
in the Working Capital Escrow Account, after giving effect to clause (c)(i),
shall be concurrently released to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the
Selling Partners) for deposit in the Merger Fund. If (1) the Final Adjustment
_plus_ Final 2017 PA Gaming Reimbursement Amount, is _greater_ _than_ (2) the
Estimated Adjustment _plus_ Estimated 2017 PA Gaming Reimbursement Amount
(such amount, a " _Purchase Price Increase_ "), then promptly following the
Determination Date (but in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter),
(x) Parent and Selling Partners Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent in writing to release all remaining funds in the Working Capital
Escrow Account to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Selling Partners)
and (y) Parent shall pay the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Selling
Partners) for deposit in the Merger Fund an amount equal to the Purchase Price
Increase. If there is no difference between the Final Adjustment and Estimated
Adjustment, then there will be no adjustment to the Closing Payment pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ and Parent and the Selling Partners
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to release
all remaining funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account to the Paying Agent
(for the benefit of the Selling Partners) for deposit in the Merger Fund.

for a period ending prior to or including the Closing Date.

 

(i) The Partnership has not engaged in a "reportable transaction" as defined

time made under this Agreement; or (b) any material failure of the notifying
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with

effect the Transaction not to be satisfied.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Partnership shall not, and the
Partnership shall cause the Selling Partners and their respective

Owned Real Property with all ordinary and customary endorsements acceptable to
a reasonably prudent buyer including non-imputation endorsements, and, in

Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of the
Partnership, to the extent such past practice complies with applicable Law. No
later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for
filing such Tax Returns (or, if the filing deadline is within thirty (30)
days after Closing, then as promptly as possible), Parent shall deliver the
Tax Returns described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.09(a)_ to the Selling Partners
Representative for its review and comment, provided, however, that any such
review and comment shall not be delayed unreasonably and, so long as Parent
shall have provided such returns to the Selling Partners Representative on a
timely basis, if the Selling Partners Representative presents no comments to
any such returns by their due date, such returns shall be filed as provided
by Parent. Parent shall make such changes as are reasonably requested by the
Selling Partners Representative to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law. Parent shall file or cause to be filed all such Tax Returns on or prior
to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Returns, shall timely
pay all Taxes due as reflected on such Tax Returns, shall provide the Selling
Partners Representative with copies of the proof of mailing of the returns by

extensions) for filing such Tax Returns, the amount of any Taxes due as
reflected on such Tax Returns (including any amounts required to be remitted
by the Partnership on account of withholding required by any federal, state
or local jurisdiction with respect to the income or gain of the Partnership
allocable to the Partners).

 

(b) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Partnership for all periods beginning after the
Closing Date and for any Straddle Period (other than Pass-Through Tax Returns)
and all such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Law.
If any such Tax Return relates to a Straddle Period or otherwise could give
rise to an indemnification obligation on the part of the Selling Partners
pursuant to _Article X_ , Parent shall deliver to the Selling Partners
Representative a draft of such Tax Returns at least twenty (20) days prior to
filing thereof (or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date or the end of the relevant taxable period, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing or end of such taxable period) and shall
permit Selling Partners Representative to review and comment on such Tax
Return. Parent shall consider in good faith any revisions to such Tax Returns
as are reasonably requested by Selling Partners Representative, provided such
comments are delivered to Parent in writing within ten (10) days of the
Selling Partners RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Tax Return (or, if shorter,
the due date for such Tax Return).

 



42 (c) Selling Partners Representative shall prepare and file, or shall cause to
be prepared and filed, all Pass-Through Tax Returns, regardless of when such
Pass-Through Tax Returns are due. Selling Partners Representative shall permit
Parent to review and comment on each such Pass-Through Tax Return described in
the preceding sentence prior to filing such Pass-Through Tax Return and shall
consider in good faith any revisions to such Pass-Through Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by Parent that relate to an item or position reflected
on, or omitted from, a Pass-Through Tax Return that could have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Partnership after the Closing Date) for any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date or for which any of them might have any liability for Taxes not
fully indemnified pursuant to _Article X_.

(d) If any taxable period of the Partnership with respect to any Tax does not
end on the Closing Date, Parent and Selling Partners shall elect to have the
taxable periods of the Partnership end as of the close of business on the
Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable Law. If such election
cannot be made, such that a Tax Return is required to be filed for any
Straddle Period, the parties agree to use the following conventions for
determining the amount of Tax attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date: (a) with respect to any Taxes based on or
measured by net income or earnings, gross income or earnings, capital or net
worth, or any other Taxes resulting from or imposed on sales, receipts, uses,
transfers or assignments of property or other assets, payments or accruals to
other Persons (including wages), or any similar transaction or transactions,
the amount that would be payable for the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date if the Partnership filed a separate Tax Return with
respect to such Taxes solely for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date using a "closing of the books" method and (b) in the case of
all other Taxes, an amount equal to the amount of Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(e) Parent and Selling Partners Representative agree that the Partnership will
not incur Pennsylvania state and local realty transfer taxes by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Should any taxing authority
assert otherwise, Parent and Selling Partners agree jointly to defend against
any such assertion. Parent and Selling Partners will equally bear the cost of
the defense of any such assertion, any settlement thereof, and any liability
found to be due.

(f) Parent and Selling Partners agree to furnish (or cause to be furnished)
to the other, upon reasonable request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes, including access to books and
records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by
Parent, the Partnership, or Selling Partners, the preparation for any audit by
any Tax Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
Proceeding relating to Taxes. Parent and Selling Partners shall retain all
books and records with respect to Taxes of the Partnership for a period of at
least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.

 

(g) Following the Closing, Parent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Partnership, on the one hand, and Selling Partners, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify each other upon receipt of notice of any inquiries, claims,
assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes for which such
other party may be liable hereunder (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, 

 



43  audit or similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ "). Any failure to so notify the
other party of any Tax Contest shall not relieve such other party of any
liability with respect to such Tax Contest except to the extent such party
was actually and materially prejudiced as a result thereof. Selling Partners
Representative shall have the right to control (at Selling PartnersÂ’ own
expense) the conduct and resolution of any Tax Contest to the extent the Tax
Contest relates solely to income Taxes of Selling Partners or Taxes for which
Selling Partners must indemnify Parent pursuant to this Agreement, _provided_
, that (a) Selling Partners Representative shall keep Parent informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest, including
providing Parent with all substantive written materials relating to such Tax
Contest received from the relevant Tax Authority and all substantive
written materials submitted to such Tax Authority by Selling Partners
Representative, (b) Parent shall have the right to participate in such Tax
Contest (at ParentÂ’s own expense), including having an opportunity to comment
on any substantive written materials prepared in connection therewith and
attending any conferences relating thereto, and (c) Selling Partners
Representative shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that would have
an adverse impact on Parent or the Partnership without ParentÂ’s prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If
Selling Partners Representative shall have the right to control the conduct
and resolution of such Tax Contest but elect in writing not to do so, then
Parent shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax
Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Parent shall keep Selling Partners
Representative informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of
such Tax Contest, including providing Selling Partners Representative with all
substantive written materials relating to such Tax Contest received from the
relevant Tax Authority and all substantive written materials submitted to
such Tax Authority by Parent, and (b) Parent shall not resolve such Tax
Contest without Selling Partners RepresentativeÂ’s written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Selling Partners Representative shall
have the right to select counsel and other tax professionals of its choosing
in connection with any Tax Contest for which it has the right to control under
this Agreement and Parent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Partnership,
shall reasonably cooperate in assisting Selling Partners Representative to
control such Tax Contest, including by promptly executing any powers of
attorney, waivers, or consents necessary to permit Selling Partners
Representative to control such Tax Contest.

 

(h) Any and all Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar agreements
binding the Partnership shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, from
and after the Closing Date, the Partnership shall not be obligated to make any
payment to any Person pursuant thereto.

 

(i) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.09_ and  _Article X_ , the provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 7.09_ shall control.

Section 7.10  _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing, each of the
Selling Partners shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, hold in
confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, exclusively

their Affiliates, (b) is lawfully acquired by them after the Closing from
sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation, (c) is reasonably relevant for enforcing

interpretation, entry into, performance, breach or termination of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (d) is disclosed with the prior
written consent of Parent or (e) as required by applicable Law, Order or
judicial or administrative process. If any of the Selling Partners or any of
their Affiliates are compelled to disclose any such information by judicial
or administrative process or by other requirements of Law or Order, such
Person shall promptly notify Parent in writing and shall disclose only that
portion of such information which such Person is advised by its counsel is
legally required to be disclosed; _provided_ that such Person shall exercise
its reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available
in this Agreement, the parties each acknowledge that money damages may not be
an adequate remedy for any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ and that

way of injunction in respect of a breach or threatened breach of any this
_Section_ __ _ 7.10_.

or indirectly out of, or relates directly or indirectly to, any circumstance,
agreement, activity, action, omission, event or matter occurring or existing
on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that Released Claims

such Selling PartnerÂ’s rights under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or
any Related Party Agreement.

right to be retained in the employment of Parent or its Affiliates, the
Surviving Partnership or any related employer, or to interfere with ParentÂ’s
or its AffiliateÂ’s right to terminate employment of any Employee at any time,
for any or no reason. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _
7.16_, nothing in this Agreement shall diminish ParentÂ’s or its AffiliateÂ’s
rights to change or terminate its or their policies regarding salaries,
benefits and other employment matters at any time or from time to time. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and the Employees are not intended to

hereof and no provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Employee.

Party shall be entitled to indemnification from the Selling Partners pursuant

Fundamental Representation) unless the aggregate claims for Damages of Parent
Indemnified Parties for which indemnification is sought pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.02(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to a breach of any Fundamental
Representation) exceed Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the "

Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification from the Selling
Partners, and the Selling Partners shall not be liable to any Parent
Indemnified Parties, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ to the extent the

(d) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to a Parent Indemnified
Party hereunder, (i) the amount of the Damages shall not be duplicative of
any other Damages for which an indemnification claim has been made, (ii) shall
be computed net of any amounts actually recovered by such Parent Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates under any insurance policy with respect to such

resulting therefrom, and net of collection costs and other costs associated

in the case of a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.09(e)(i)_ in which the

proceedings as contemplated by such section, then Purchaser shall recover any
Damages related to such breach from the condemnation proceeds before seeking
recovery from the Escrow Fund. To the extent insured, Parent Indemnified Party

recovery of any portion of the applicable Damages with respect thereto prior

neither Parent nor any other Parent Indemnified Party will have an obligation
to seek or obtain additional insurance policies or increase the scope or size
of coverage of existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Survival Period of the representation, warranty or covenant whose breach gives
rise to Damages in respect of which Parent Indemnified Party is seeking an
insurance recovery shall be tolled during the period that Parent Indemnified
Party is seeking such recovery until such time as the recovery is denied or
awarded (the " _Tolling Period_ ") and the Survival Period in respect of
such representation, warranty or covenant shall be extended for all purposes
of this Agreement by the

 



54  duration of the Tolling Period, and (ii) Parent shall not be required to
seek recovery under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy for
Damages up to the Escrow Amount.

 

(e) Upon and becoming aware of any event which is reasonably likely to give
rise to losses subject to indemnification hereunder, each Parent Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the losses arising
from such events.

 

(f) Except in the case of fraud by Parent, neither Parent nor the Partnership
shall be liable to the Selling Partner Indemnified Parties for
indemnification from any of them pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)(i)_
(other than with respect to a breach of any Fundamental Representation) unless
the aggregate claims for Damages of Selling Partner Indemnified Parties for
which indemnification is sought pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)(i)_
(other than with respect to a breach of any Fundamental Representation) exceed
the Basket, in which event Parent and the Partnership shall be liable for all
indemnifiable Damages exceeding the Basket. The aggregate amount of Damages
for all indemnification claims of Selling Partner Indemnified Parties shall
not exceed in the aggregate the Merger Consideration.

 

(g) In calculating the amount of Damages payable to a Parent Indemnified Party
under _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ or to a Selling Partner Indemnified Party
under _Section_ __ _ 10.02(b)_, any materiality, material adverse effect or
Material Adverse Effect standard or qualification contained in any
representation or warranty shall, in respect of the breach or inaccuracy of

If a claim for Damages is to be made by a Parent Indemnified Party or a
Selling Partner Indemnified Party (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") entitled
to indemnification hereunder, such party shall give written notice briefly
describing the claim and, to the extent then ascertainable, the monetary
damages sought (each, a " _Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party hereunder
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnifying Parties_
") as soon as practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any
fact, condition or event which may give rise to Damages for which
indemnification may be sought under this _Article X_. Any failure to submit
any such notice of claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure.

Section 10.05  _Defense of_ _Third Party Claims_.

(a) Other than with respect to a Tax Matter, which shall be governed by 
_Section_ __ _ 7.09_, the right of an Indemnified Party with respect to
Damages resulting from the assertion of liability by a third party shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.05_. If any
Proceeding is initiated against an Indemnified Party by any third party (each,
a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification under this _Article X_
may be sought, Notice thereof, together with copies of all notices and
communication relating to such Third Party Claim, shall be given to the
Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable. The failure of any Indemnified
Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect rights to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



55 (b) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.05_ the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to:

(i) take control of and conduct the defense and investigation of such Third
Party Claim by written notice to the Indemnified Party;

(ii) employ and engage attorneys of its own choice to handle and defend the
same, unless the named parties to such Proceeding include both one or more
Indemnifying Parties and an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party has
reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses or defense
strategies available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying Party or that
there exists a conflict of interest, in which event such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to separate counsel ( _provided,_ that such counsel is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party); and

 

(iii) compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, which compromise or
settlement shall be made (x) only with the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
or (y) if such compromise or settlement contains an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, without any admission of
wrongdoing of any nature whatsoever to or by such Indemnified Party, and
provides only for monetary damages that will be paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party (other than an amount equal to the Basket) under the terms
of this Agreement;

_provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to
take control of and conduct the defense if such Third Party Claim involves an
injunction or equitable relief, any non-monetary damages, any monetary damages
less than the deductible, or criminal liability, in which case, the
Indemnified Party will take control and conduct the defense, compromise and
settlement of such Third Party Claim (but such Third Party Claim shall not be
compromised or settled without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to take control and conduct the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom;
_provided, however,_ that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost,
participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action
and any appeal arising therefrom. The parties shall reasonably cooperate with
each other in any notifications to insurers.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice, the Indemnified
Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted will have the
right to take control and conduct the defense of, and to compromise or settle,
such Third Party Claim;  _provided, however,_ that such Third Party Claim
shall not be compromised or settled without the written consent of the

Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an

of this Agreement. The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean
that on or before 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the third (3rd) Business Day
immediately preceding the Effective Date, the Partnership has posted complete

prior to such time.

 

Section 11.05 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the Partnership Disclosure Letter and exhibits hereto and thereto
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 

Section 11.06 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transaction is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent
of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the Transaction is fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 11.07 _Assignment_. Without the prior written consent of the other
parties, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party to any other Person. Any
assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void, and no

obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may collaterally
assign, and grant a security interest over, its rights and interests under
this Agreement to its financing sources.

 

Section 11.08 _Parties_ _of Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is

Section 11.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or
electronic mail transmission and/or in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall

one and the same agreement.

of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the parties. In the event that any ambiguity or question
of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by
the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 

Section 11.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Parent and the
Partnership.

Section 11.12 _Waiver_. Any party may waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party.

Prussia Mixed Use) and the current use of the Real Property is in compliance
with all applicable zoning laws and ordinances. Failure of this Agreement to

Section 11.14 _Attorney-Client Privilege_. The parties acknowledge the
community of interest between the Partnership and the Selling Partners in
view of the fact that the Selling Partners own all of the Partnership
Interests. Thus, from and after the Closing, (i) all communications prior to
the Closing that are privileged attorney-client confidences exempt from
disclosure under applicable Law between any Selling Partner and the
Partnership, on the one hand, and Partnership legal counsel, on the other
hand, in the course of their engagement with Partnership legal counsel with
regard to the negotiation and Closing of this Agreement and the documents
ancillary hereto shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong
solely to the Selling Partners and not the Partnership, (ii) Purchaser and
Parent shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of
Partnership legal counsel to the extent relating to any representation by
Partnership legal counsel of the Partnership or any Selling Partner prior to
the Closing in connection with the negotiation and Closing of this Agreement
and the documents ancillary hereto, in each case to the extent such files are
otherwise privileged and exempt from disclosure under applicable Law, (iii)
the applicable Selling Partner shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to the representation by Partnership legal
counsel of the

 



77  Partnership or any Selling Partner prior to the Closing with regard to the
negotiation and Closing of this Agreement and the documents ancillary hereto,
and neither the Partnership nor Purchaser or Parent shall be a holder
thereof, (iv) to the extent that files of Partnership legal counsel of the
type described in clause (ii) above are kept in connection with the
negotiation and Closing of this Agreement and the documents ancillary hereto,
and such files constitute property of the client, only the Selling Partners
shall hold such property rights, and (v) Partnership legal counsel shall have
no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such privileged attorney-client
communications or any such privileged files to the Partnership or Purchaser or
Parent by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Partnership legal
counsel and the Partnership entered into in connection with the
negotiation and Closing of this Agreement and the documents ancillary hereto.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_
shall be deemed to apply to any communication or file that is not
otherwise privileged and exempt from disclosure under applicable Law, it
being the intent of the parties not to expand the scope of any privilege but
rather to provide that the applicable privilege shall belong solely to the
Selling Partners from and after the Closing.
