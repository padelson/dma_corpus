 **1.11** Exhibit

  

 ** **

  

The following exhibit attached hereto is incorporated into and forms an
integral part of this Agreement:

  



  

A - Plan of Arrangement

  



  

 **ARTICLE 2 
 THE ARRANGEMENT**

  

 ** **

  

 **2.1** Plan of Arrangement

  

 ** **

  

(a) The Parties agree to carry out the Arrangement pursuant to which (among
other things) holders of Canetic Units shall receive, for each Canetic Unit
held, 0.515 of a Penn West Unit, all as more particularly described in the
Plan of Arrangement attached as Exhibit A hereto.

  



  

(b) The Arrangement has been and shall continue to be structured:

  



  

(i) to allow Canetic Unitholders to receive Penn West Units on a tax-deferred
basis for Canadian and United States income tax purposes; and

  



  

(ii) such that the issuance of the Penn West Units under the Arrangement
qualifies for the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of
the U.S. Securities Act.

  



  

(c) Canetic and CRI shall, with assistance from and the participation of Penn
West and PWPL, file, proceed with and diligently prosecute an application for
an Interim Order providing for, among other things, the calling and holding
of the Canetic Meeting for the purpose of considering and, if deemed
advisable, approving the Arrangement Resolution and related matters to be
considered at the Canetic Meeting.

  



  

(d) Provided all necessary approvals for the Arrangement Resolution are
obtained from the Canetic Unitholders, Canetic and CRI shall, with assistance
from and the participation of Penn West and PWPL, submit the Arrangement to
the Court and apply for the Final Order.

  



  

(e) Upon issuance of the Final Order and subject to the conditions precedent
in Article 5, each of Penn West and PWPL on the one hand and Canetic and CRI
on the other hand shall execute and deliver such closing documents and
instruments and forthwith proceed at the Closing Time to file the Articles of
Arrangement, the Final Order and such other documents as may be required to
give effect to the Arrangement with the Registrar pursuant to Subsection
193(9) of the ABCA, whereupon the transactions comprising the Arrangement
shall occur and shall be deemed to have occurred in the order set out therein
without any further act or formality.

  



  

 **2.2** Interim Order

  



  

The Interim Order shall provide that:

  



  

(a) the securities of Canetic for which holders shall be entitled to vote on
the Arrangement Resolution at the Canetic Meeting shall be the Canetic Units;

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

(b) each Canetic Unitholder shall be entitled to one vote for each Canetic
Unit held by such holder; and

  



  

(c) the requisite majority for the approval of the Arrangement Resolution
shall be two-thirds of the votes cast by the Canetic Unitholders present in
person or by proxy at the Canetic Meeting.

  



  

 **2.3** Information Circular and Meeting

  

 ** **

  

As promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and in
compliance with the Interim Order and Applicable Laws, including Applicable
Canadian Securities Laws and U.S. Securities Laws, Canetic and CRI shall,
with assistance from and the participation of Penn West and PWPL: (i) prepare
the Canetic Information Circular and cause such circular to be mailed to the
Canetic Unitholders and filed with applicable regulatory authorities and
other governmental authorities in all jurisdictions where the same are
required to be mailed and filed; and (ii) convene the Canetic Meeting.

  



  

 **2.4** Employees

  

 ** **

  

(a) Unless otherwise agreed among the Parties not less than one week prior to
the Effective Date in accordance with Section 3.3(b), the employment of all
Canetic Employees and all Penn West Employees (the " **Continuing Employees**
") will be continued by PWPL or CRI (or their amalgamation successor) or one
of their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be. The Continuing
Employees, unless their employment is terminated, shall continue their
employment on the terms and conditions comparable, in the aggregate, to the
terms and conditions on which they are currently employed.

  



  

(b) In the event that the employment of any Canetic Employee or any Penn West
Employee is not continued as a Continuing Employee by PWPL or CRI (or their
amalgamation successor) or one of their respective Subsidiaries and such
employee is thereby entitled to a severance payment, or such employee is
otherwise entitled to a severance payment at law, the amount of such
severance payment shall be agreed on by the Parties, acting reasonably.

  



  

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the Arrangement will result in a "change of
control" for purposes of the Canetic Unit Award Incentive Plan and the
Canetic Employment Agreements. The Canetic Disclosure Letter sets forth a
bona fide, good faith estimate by Canetic, having regard to the assumptions
set forth therein, of all obligations of Canetic pursuant to all employment
or consulting services agreements, termination, severance and retention plans
or policies for severance, termination or bonus payments or any other
payments related to any Canetic incentive plan (including, without
limitation, the Canetic Employment Agreements and the Canetic Incentive
Plans), arising directly as a result of the Arrangement (collectively, the "
**Canetic Change of Control Payments** "). For greater certainty, the Canetic
Change of Control Payments disclosed in the Canetic Disclosure Letter exclude
any severance payments that may become payable as a result of the events
described in Section 2.4(b).

  



  

(d) (i) The Parties agree that upon approval of the Arrangement by
Canetic Unitholders, and prior to the Effective Date, all outstanding Canetic
Unit entitlements under the Canetic Unit Award Incentive Plan and Canetic
Employment Agreements (including any Canetic Unit entitlements constituting
Canetic Change of Control Payments) shall be paid in Canetic Units to be
issued from treasury (and, for greater certainty, shall not be paid in cash),
which will entitle the holders of such Canetic Units to participate in the
Arrangement on the same basis as all other Canetic Unitholders at the
Effective Time (and, if declared by the Canetic Board of Directors, in its
discretion, pursuant to

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

Section 2.6, will entitle the holders of such Canetic Units to receive the
Canetic Special Distribution).

  



  

(ii) Each of Canetic and CRI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the resignation of all of the directors and officers of CRI immediately
following the Effective Time.

  



  

(iii) The Parties agree that the Canetic Change of Control Payments that are
payable in cash shall be paid to the Canetic Employees entitled thereto
immediately following the Effective Time concurrent with the execution of
mutual releases in substantially the forms thereof appended to the Canetic
Employment Agreements.

  



  

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the Arrangement will not result in a "change
of control" or any other form of accelerated vesting for the purposes of the
Penn West Incentive Plan and any executive employment or change of control
agreements applicable to Penn West Employees or the directors of PWPL
(including the Penn West Employment Agreements) and will not constitute a
"change of control" or result in accelerated vesting for the purposes of any
other employment or consulting services agreement, incentive, bonus or
similar plan.

  



  

 **2.5** Effective Date

  



  

The Arrangement shall become effective at the Effective Time on the Effective
Date. The Parties shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause
the Effective Date to occur on or about January 11, 2008 or as soon
thereafter as reasonably practicable and in any event by January 30, 2008.
The parties agree that the Effective Date will not occur on a date that would
have the result of a Canetic Unitholder not being entitled to receive a
distribution payable by Penn West in the month following the month in which
the Effective Date occurs.

  



  

 **2.6** Canetic Special Distribution

  

 ** **

  

The Parties agree that Canetic may declare and pay a special cash
distribution in the amount of Cdn. $0.09 per Canetic Unit (the "
**Canetic Special Distribution** "), which Canetic Special Distribution shall
be payable to Canetic Unitholders of record on or about the close of business
on the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Date.

  



  

 **2.7** United States Tax Considerations

  

 ** **

  

The Parties intend that the series of transactions to be conducted pursuant
to the Plan of Arrangement (" **Combination Transactions** "), considered
together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income
tax purposes, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the " **Code** "). This
Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). Each Party agrees that it
shall (a) treat the Combination Transactions as a single integrated
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (b) treat the Combination
Transactions as a single integrated transaction that qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and (c)
retain such records and file such information as is required to be retained
and filed pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 in connection with
the Combination Transactions. Excluding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, no Party shall take any action, fail
to take any action, cause any action to be taken or cause any action to fail
to be taken that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Combination
Transactions, considered together as a single integrated transaction, from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of
the Code with respect to Canetic and the Canetic Unitholders.

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

 **2.8** Post-Closing Wind-up

  

 ** **

  

On the date after the Effective Date, Penn West shall cause Canetic to file
an election on U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (Entity Classification
Election) to classify Canetic as a disregarded entity for United States
federal income tax purposes as permitted under Section 7701 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and at all times after the
Effective Time, Penn West shall be the sole unitholder and equity holder in
Canetic. Furthermore, Canetic shall not engage in any business or hold any
assets (other than a minimal amount of cash) from the Effective Time until
the day after such election is filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

or other representative retained by it to do, any of the following:

  



  

(i) solicit, knowingly facilitate, initiate or encourage any Acquisition
Proposal;

  



  

(ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
an Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to its businesses, properties, operations, prospects or conditions
(financial or otherwise) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt of any other Person to do or seek to do

(iii) waive, or otherwise forbear in the enforcement of, or enter into or

provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision hereof, each

party who (without any solicitation, initiation or encouragement, directly or
indirectly, after the date of this Agreement, by such Party or any of its
officers, directors or employees or any financial advisor, expert or other
representative retained by it) seeks to initiate such discussions or
negotiations and, subject to execution of a confidentiality and standstill
agreement substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreements (provided
that such confidentiality agreement shall provide for disclosure thereof
(along with all information provided thereunder) to the Other Party as set
out below), may furnish to such third party information concerning such Party
and its business, properties and assets, in each case if, and only to the
extent that:

  



  

(A) the third party has first made a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal
which the board of directors of such Party determines in good faith: (1) that
funds or other consideration necessary for the Acquisition Proposal are or
are likely to be available; (2) (after consultation with its financial
advisor) would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a
transaction financially superior for unitholders of the Receiving Party than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement; and (3) after receiving the
advice of outside counsel as reflected in minutes of the board of directors
of the administrator of such Party, that the taking of such action is
necessary for the board of directors in discharge of its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Laws and the constating documents of the Receiving Party (a
" **Superior Proposal** "); and

  



  

(B) prior to furnishing such information to or entering into or participating
in any such discussions or negotiations with such third party, such Party
provides prompt notice to the Other Party to the effect that it is furnishing
information to or entering into or participating in discussions or
negotiations with such Person together with a copy of the confidentiality
agreement referenced above

  



        
   

  



  

and if not previously provided to the Other Party, copies of all information
provided to such third party concurrently with the provision of such
information to such third party, and provided further that such Party shall
notify the Other Party orally and in writing of any inquiries, offers or
proposals with respect to a Superior Proposal (which written notice shall
include, without limitation, a copy of any such proposal (and any amendments
or supplements thereto), the identity of the Person making it, if not
previously provided to the Other Party, copies of all information provided to
such Party and all other information reasonably requested by the
Other Party), within 24 hours of the receipt thereof, shall keep the Other
Party informed of the status and details of any such inquiry, offer or
proposal and answer the Other Partys questions with respect thereto; and

  



  

(vi) comply with Section 172 of the _Securities Act_  (Alberta) and similar
provisions under Applicable Canadian Securities Laws relating to the
provision of directors circulars and make appropriate disclosure with
respect thereto to its securityholders; and

Superior Proposal from a third party, but only if prior to such acceptance,
recommendation, approval or implementation, the board of directors of such
Party shall have concluded in good faith, after considering all proposals to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section
3.4(c) and after receiving the advice of outside counsel as reflected in
minutes of the board of directors of such Party, that the taking of such
action is necessary for the board of directors of such Party in discharge of
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws and such Party complies with its
obligations set forth in Section 3.4(c) and terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f), as applicable, and
concurrently therewith pays the amount required by Section ** ** 6.1 or 6.2,
as applicable, to the Other Party.

  



  

(c) Any Party in receipt of a Superior Proposal (a " **Receiving Party** ")
shall give the Other Party (the " **Responding Party** "), orally and in
writing, at least 72 hours advance notice of any decision by the board of
directors of the Receiving Party to accept, recommend, approve or enter into
an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal, which notice shall confirm
that the board of directors of the Receiving Party has determined that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall identify
the third party making the Superior Proposal and shall provide a true and
complete copy thereof and any amendments thereto. During such 72 hour period,
the Receiving Party agrees not to accept, recommend, approve or enter into
any agreement to implement such Superior Proposal and not to release the
party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall
not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect of
the Arrangement. In addition, during such 72 hour period the Receiving Party
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good
faith with the Responding Party and its financial and legal advisors to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Arrangement as would enable the Receiving Party to proceed with the
Arrangement as amended rather than the Superior Proposal. In the event the
Responding Party proposes to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement to
provide the holders of Penn West Units or the Canetic Units, as applicable,
(the " **Receiving Party Securities** ") with a value per Receiving
Party Security equal to or having a value greater than the value per
Receiving Party Security provided in the Superior Proposal and so advises the
board of directors of the Receiving Party prior to the expiry of such 72 hour
period, the board of directors of the Receiving Party shall not accept,
recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such Superior
Proposal and

  



        
   

  



  

shall not release the party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill
provisions and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its
recommendation in respect of the Arrangement.

  



  

(d) Each Party agrees that all information that may be provided to it by the
Other Party with respect to any Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section
3.4 shall be treated as if it were " **Confidential Information** " as that
term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreements and shall not be disclosed
or used except in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreements or in order to enforce its rights under this Agreement in legal
proceedings.

  



  

(e) Each Party shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and
any investment bankers or other advisers or representatives retained by it
are aware of the provisions of this Section 3.4 applicable to such Party.
Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 3.4 by such
Partys officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, advisers or
representatives.

  



  

 **3.5** Provision of Information; Access

  

 ** **

  

From and after the date hereof, each Party shall provide the Other Party and
its representatives access, during normal business hours and at such other
time or times as Canetic and Penn West may reasonably request, to its
premises (including field offices and sites), books, contracts, records,
computer systems, properties, employees and management personnel and shall
furnish promptly to Canetic or Penn West, as the case may be, all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Canetic or
Penn West may reasonably request, which information shall remain subject to
the Confidentiality Agreements, in order to permit Canetic and Penn West to
be in a position to expeditiously and efficiently integrate the business and
operations of each of Canetic and Penn West immediately upon but not prior to
the Effective Date. Without limitation, representatives of each Party will
be permitted to attend the Other Partys weekly operations meetings. Each
Party agrees to keep the Other Party fully appraised in a timely manner of
every circumstance, action, occurrence or event occurring or arising after
the date hereof that would be relevant and material to a prudent operator of
the business and operations of Canetic and Penn West. Each Party shall confer
with and obtain the Other Partys approval (not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), prior to taking action (other than in emergency situations)
with respect to any material operational matters involved in its business.

which agreement, commitment or understanding would have a Material Adverse
Effect on Canetic or Penn West (including, for greater certainty, following

Act_ (Canada)) and third party approvals and consents in respect of the
completion of the Arrangement shall have been obtained on terms and
conditions satisfactory to Penn West and Canetic, each acting
reasonably, including, without limitation (i) conditional approval to the
listing of the Penn West Units issuable or to be made issuable pursuant to
the Arrangement (including the Penn West Units issuable pursuant to the terms
of the Canetic Debentures to be assumed by Penn West pursuant to the
Arrangement) on the TSX and approval, subject to official notice of issuance,
of the listing of such securities on the NYSE, and (ii) conditional approval

and foreign statutory and regulatory waiting periods shall have expired or
have been terminated and no unresolved material objection or opposition shall
have been filed, initiated or made during any applicable statutory or
regulatory period;

  



  

(j) if required, the Arrangement, and the consummation thereof, shall have
been approved by Penn Wests lenders on a basis acceptable to Penn West and
Canetic, each acting reasonably;

  



  

(k) no act, action, suit, proceeding, objection or opposition shall have been
threatened or taken before or by any domestic or foreign court, tribunal or
Governmental Entity or other regulatory or administrative agency or

Canada or elsewhere, whether or not having the force of Law, and no Law,
regulation, policy, judgment, decision, order, ruling or directive (whether
or not having the force of Law) shall have been proposed, enacted,
promulgated, amended or applied, which in the sole judgment of Penn West or
Canetic (as applicable), acting reasonably, in either case has had or, if the
Arrangement was consummated, would result in a Material Adverse Change in the
affairs, operations or business of Canetic or Penn West, respectively, or
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Parties to
complete the Arrangement;

  



  

(l) Penn West and Canetic shall have executed such instruments, and the
Canetic Debenture Trustee shall have received such opinions, as contemplated
and required by the Canetic Debenture Indenture, in order to provide for the
assumption, as of the Effective Date, by Penn West of all of the obligations
of Canetic under the Canetic Debenture Indenture in respect of the Canetic
Debentures, such that, as of the Effective Date, the Canetic Debentures
become valid and binding obligations of Penn West entitling the holders
thereof, as against Penn West, to all of the rights of holders of Canetic
Debentures under the Canetic Debenture Indenture;

  



  

(m) the Parties shall have (i) received resignations from the directors and

the directors and officers of Canetic, which mutual releases shall be
delivered and effective immediately following the Effective Time and shall be
in substantially the forms thereof appended to the Canetic Employment
Agreements; and

  



  

(n) the Parties shall be satisfied, acting reasonably, that each of Canetic
and Penn West is a "mutual fund trust" within the meaning of the ITA
immediately prior to the time of completion of the Arrangement, and the
completion of the Arrangement shall not cause Penn West to cease to be a
"mutual fund trust" within the meaning of the ITA or cause the tax measures
announced by the Minister of Finance (Canada) on October 31, 2006 and
contained in Bill C-52 which received royal assent on June 22, 2007 to apply
to Penn West before 2011.

  



  

The foregoing conditions are for the mutual benefit of Canetic and Penn West
and may be asserted by Canetic and Penn West regardless of the circumstances
and may be waived by Canetic and Penn West (with respect to such Party) in
their sole discretion, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time
without prejudice to any other rights which Canetic or Penn West may have.

warranties of any Party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, or (ii) result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any
Party hereunder; provided, however, that no such notification will affect the

 AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS**

  

 ** **

  

 **6.1** Penn West Damages

  

 ** **

  

If at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to its
termination:

  



  

(a) the Canetic Board of Directors has withdrawn or changed any of its
recommendations or determinations referred to in Section 3.2(o) and Section
4.2(vv) in a manner adverse to Penn West or shall have resolved to do so
prior to the Effective Date;

  



  

(b) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered
or made to the Canetic Unitholders or to Canetic and the Canetic Unitholders
do not approve the Arrangement or the Arrangement is not submitted for their
approval, and such Acquisition Proposal, an amended version thereof or any

implement a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(d) Canetic is in breach of any of its covenants made in this Agreement,
which breach individually or in the aggregate causes or would reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to Canetic or
materially impedes the completion of the Arrangement, and Canetic fails to
cure such breach within five Business Days after receipt of written notice
thereof from Penn West (except that no cure period shall be provided for a
breach which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure
period extend beyond January 30, 2008); or

  



  

(e) Canetic is in breach of any of its representations or warranties made in
this Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality qualifiers contained
therein) which breach individually or in the aggregate causes or would
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to
Canetic or materially impedes the completion of the Arrangement, and Canetic
fails to cure such breach within five Business Days after receipt of written
notice thereof from Penn West (except that no cure period shall be provided
for a

  



        
   

  



  

breach which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure
period extend beyond January 30, 2008),

  



  

(each of the above being a " **Penn West Damages Event** "), then in
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1, Canetic shall pay to Penn West $125 million as liquidated damages
in immediately available funds to an account designated by Penn West within
one Business Day after the first to occur of the events described above, and
after such event but prior to payment of such amount, Canetic shall be deemed
to hold such funds in trust for Penn West. Canetic shall only be obligated to
pay a maximum of $125 million pursuant to this Section 6.1. In the event that
a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered or
made to the Canetic Unitholders or to Canetic and the Canetic Unitholders do
not approve the Arrangement or the Arrangement is not submitted for their
approval; and such Acquisition Proposal, an amended version thereof or any

proposed, offered or made, then Canetic shall pay to Penn West $5 million, in
full satisfaction of, and as a fixed amount for reimbursement of, all
expenses, including all third party expenses and costs, of Penn West in
relation to the Arrangement.

  



  

 **6.2** Canetic Damages

  

 ** **

  

If at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to its
termination:

  



  

(a) Penn West accepts, recommends, approves or enters into an agreement to
implement a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(b) Penn West is in breach of any of its covenants made in this Agreement,
which breach individually or in the aggregate causes or would reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to Penn West or
materially impedes the completion of the Arrangement, and Penn West fails to
cure such breach within five Business Days after receipt of written notice
thereof from Canetic (except that no cure period shall be provided for a
breach which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure
period extend beyond January 30, 2008); or

  



  

(c) Penn West is in breach of any of its representations or warranties made
in this Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality qualifiers
contained therein) which breach individually or in the aggregate causes or
would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect
to Penn West or materially impedes the completion of the Arrangement, and
Penn West fails to cure such breach within five Business Days after receipt
of written notice thereof from Canetic (except that no cure period shall be
provided for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event,
shall any cure period extend beyond January 30, 2008),

  



  

(each of the above being a " **Canetic Damages Event** "), then in the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Penn
West shall pay to Canetic $125 million as liquidated damages in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Canetic within one
Business Day after the first to occur of the events described above, and
after such event but prior to payment of such amount, Penn West shall be
deemed to hold such funds in trust for Canetic. Penn West shall only be
obligated to pay a maximum of $125 million pursuant to this Section 6.2.

  



  

 **6.3** Liquidated Damages

  

 ** **

  

Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
Article 6 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate
of the damages which the Party entitled

  



        
   

  



  

to such damages will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to
such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement and are not
penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a
defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For
greater certainty, the Parties agree that the payment of the amount pursuant
to this Article 6 is the sole monetary remedy of the Party receiving such
payment provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply in the event
of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the Party obligated to make
such payment. Nothing herein shall preclude a Party from seeking injunctive
relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreements or
otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such act, covenants or
agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection
therewith.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 7 
 AMENDMENT**

  

 ** **

  

 **7.1** Amendment of Agreement

  

 ** **

  

This Agreement (excluding the Plan of Arrangement) may at any time and from
time to time before or after the holding of the Canetic Meeting be amended by
written agreement of the Parties hereto without, subject to Applicable Law,
further notice to or authorization on the part of the Canetic Unitholders and
any such amendment may, without limitation:

Parties;

  



  

(b) waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation or warranty contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;

waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of the Parties; or

  



  

(d) waive compliance with or modify any other conditions precedent contained
herein;

  



  

provided that no such amendment which is agreed to after the Parties are
granted the Interim Order by the Court may reduce or materially adversely
affect the consideration to be received by Canetic Unitholders or result in
Canetic Unitholders receiving Penn West Units on a non-tax deferred basis for
Canadian or United States income tax purposes without approval by the Canetic
Unitholders given in the same manner as required for the approval of the
Arrangement or as may be ordered by the Court.

  



  

 **7.2** Amendment of Plan of Arrangement

  

 ** **

  

(a) The Parties may agree to amend the Plan of Arrangement at any time and
from time to time prior to the Effective Time, provided that each such
amendment must be: (i) set out in writing; (ii) filed with the Court and, if
made following the Canetic Meeting, approved by the Court; and (iii)
communicated to holders of Canetic Units if and as required by the Court.

  



  

(b) Any amendment to the Plan of Arrangement agreed to by the Parties at any
time prior to or at the Canetic Meeting, which is proposed and accepted by
the holders of Canetic Units voting at the Canetic Meeting, shall become part
of the Plan of Arrangement for all purposes.

  



  

(c) Any amendment to the Plan of Arrangement that is approved by the Court
following the Canetic Meeting shall be effective only if it is consented to
by each of the Parties.

  



        
   

  



  

 **7.3** Alternative Transaction

  

 ** **

  

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, if the Parties are unable to
implement the transactions contemplated in this Agreement by way of plan of
arrangement, the Parties shall cooperate to implement such transactions by
way of a merger whereby Penn West would effectively acquire all or
substantially all of the assets of Canetic within approximately the same time
periods and on economic terms (including trust unit exchange ratio, payment
of the Canetic Special Distribution and tax treatment that allows Canetic
Unitholders to receive Penn West Units on a tax-deferred basis for Canadian
and United States income tax purposes) having consequences to the Canetic
Unitholders and the Penn West Unitholders that are economically equivalent to
those contemplated by this Agreement (an " **Alternative Transaction**
"). If necessary, the Parties agree to use their reasonable commercial
efforts to execute and deliver an agreement to give effect to an Alternative
Transaction, to otherwise fulfill their respective covenants contained in
this Agreement in respect of the Alternative Transaction and to prepare the
Canetic Information Circular within the time frames contemplated in this
Agreement with respect to the Arrangement.

Unitholder who is entitled to be paid the fair value of the holders Canetic
Units shall be deemed to have transferred the holders Canetic Units to
Canetic for cancellation at the Effective Time, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 191 of the ABCA. A Dissenting Unitholder who for any

Units shall be treated as if the holder had participated in the Arrangement
on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Canetic Units notwithstanding
the provisions of the Interim Order or Section 191 of the ABCA. The fair
value of the Canetic Units shall be determined as of the close of business on
the last Business Day before the day on which the Arrangement is approved by

Penn West or Canetic be required to recognize such Dissenting Unitholder as a
unitholder of Penn West or Canetic or their successors after the Effective
Time and the name of such holder shall be removed from the applicable
register of Canetic Unitholders as at the Effective Time. For greater
certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in Section 191 of the ABCA,
no person who has voted in favour of the Arrangement shall be entitled to
dissent with respect to the Arrangement.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 5 
 OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SECURITIES**

  

 ** **

  

 **5.1** ** **From and after the Effective Time, certificates
formerly representing Canetic Units that were exchanged pursuant to Section
3.1 shall represent only the right to receive the consideration to which
the holders are entitled under the Arrangement, or as to those
certificates representing Canetic Units held by Dissenting Unitholders, other
than those Dissenting Unitholders deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement pursuant to Section 4.1, to receive the fair value of the Canetic
Units represented by such certificates.

  



  

 **5.2** ** **Penn West and Canetic shall, as soon as practicable following
the later of the Effective Date and the date of deposit by a former holder
of Canetic Units of a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and
the certificates representing such Canetic Units, either:

  



  

(a) forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage prepaid) to
such former holder at the address specified in the Letter of Transmittal; or

  



  

(b) if requested by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, make available
or cause to be made available at the Depositary for pickup by such holder;

  



  

certificates representing the number of Penn West Units to be delivered to
such holders under the Arrangement.

  



  

 **5.3** ** **If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented an interest in outstanding Canetic Units that were
exchanged pursuant to Section 3.1, has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
certificate to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary shall
issue and deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate
the consideration to which the holder is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement
(and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) as determined in
accordance with the Arrangement. The person who is entitled to receive such
consideration shall, as a condition precedent to the receipt thereof,

  



        
   

  



  

give a bond to each of Penn West and Canetic and their respective transfer
agents, which bond is in form and substance satisfactory to each of the Penn
West and Canetic and their respective transfer agents, or shall otherwise
indemnify Penn West and Canetic and their respective transfer agents against
any claim that may be made against any of them with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

 **5.4** ** **All distributions made with respect to any Penn West Units
allotted and issued to former holders of Canetic Units pursuant to this Plan
of Arrangement but for which a certificate has not been issued shall be paid
or delivered to the Depositary to be held by the Depositary in trust for
the registered holder thereof. The Depositary shall pay and deliver to any
such registered holder, as soon as reasonably practicable after application
therefor is made by the registered holder to the Depositary in such form as
the Depositary may reasonably require, such distributions to which such
holder is entitled, net of applicable withholding and other taxes.

  



  

 **5.5** ** **Any certificate formerly representing Canetic Units that is
not deposited with all other documents as required by this Plan of
Arrangement on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall
cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature including the right
of the holder of such Canetic Units to receive Penn West Units and, as
applicable, cash. In such case, such Penn West Units shall be returned to
Penn West for cancellation and any distributions in respect of Penn West
Units shall be returned to Penn West.

  



  

 **5.6** ** **No certificates representing fractional Penn West Units shall
be issued under this Plan of Arrangement. In lieu of any fractional Penn
West Unit, each registered holder of Canetic Units otherwise entitled to
a fractional interest in Penn West Units, shall receive the nearest whole
number of Penn West Units, as applicable (with fractions equal to exactly 0.5
being rounded up).

  



  

 **ARTICLE 6 
 AMENDMENTS**

  

 ** **

  

 **6.1** ** **Penn West, Canetic, PWPL and CRI may amend this Plan of
Arrangement at any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the provisions of the Arrangement Agreement.

  



  

 **6.2** ** **Any amendment to this Plan of Arrangement may be made following
the Effective Time by Penn West, Canetic, PWPL and CRI, provided that it is
not adverse to the financial or economic interests of any former holder of
Canetic Units.
