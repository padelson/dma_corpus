                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of
August 4, 2003 among Gaylord Entertainment Company, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), GET Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and ResortQuest International, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                                   Background

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it
is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the
stockholders of the Company to enter into and consummate this Agreement with
Parent and Sub, and the Board of Directors of Parent has determined that it is
fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Parent and the stockholders of
Parent to enter into and consummate this Agreement with the Company, providing
for the merger of Sub with and into the Company with the Company as the
surviving corporation (the "Merger"), in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Sub has approved the Merger of Sub
with and into the Company and such other transactions in accordance with the
DGCL upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

         WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree
as follows:

                                  ARTICLE 1.
                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.1       The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL,
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company as soon as practicable following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6. Following
the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the


                                       1
<PAGE>

"Surviving Corporation") under the name " ResortQuest International, Inc." and
shall continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease. At the election of Parent, any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Sub
as a constituent corporation in the Merger. In the event of such an execution,
the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in
order to reflect such election.

         Section 1.2       Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary"), in such form as required by and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and
time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary (or
such later time as agreed to by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger) being the "Effective Time").

         Section 1.3       Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 1.4       Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws.

                  (a)      From and after the Effective Time and without any
further action on the part of the Company and Sub, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended in its entirety and
replaced by the certificate of incorporation attached as Exhibit 1.4 hereto
thereafter amended as provided by applicable law and such Certificate of
Incorporation, except only that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"ResortQuest International, Inc."

                  (b)      At the Effective Time and without any further action
on the part of the Company and Sub, the Bylaws of Sub shall be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation and thereafter may be amended or repealed in
accordance with their terms or the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable law.

         Section 1.5       Directors and Officers. The directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.

         Section 1.6       Exchange Ratio. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:


                                       2
<PAGE>

                  (i)      Each share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 1.6(ii)) shall subject to Section 1.6(iv) be exchanged
for and converted into the right to receive .275 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a
fully paid and non-assessable share of the Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock"), payable upon the surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such share of Company Common Stock.

                  (ii)     All shares of Company Common Stock that are held by
the Company as treasury shares or that are held by Parent or Sub or any
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent shall be automatically canceled and retired
and cease to exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

                  (iii)    Each share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Sub ("Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (iv)     Each outstanding option (a "Company Stock Option")
to purchase Company Common Stock that is listed on Section 2.2(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by Parent as more specifically
provided in Section 5.8.

                  (v)      Shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
this Section 1.6 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
(as defined below) shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the
Company, except the right to receive the corresponding Parent Common Stock
specified herein for each such share.

                  (vi)     If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock), subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or similar transaction,
or if Parent pays an extraordinary dividend or distribution, the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, or similar transaction
or extraordinary dividend or distribution.

         Section 1.7       Surrender and Exchange of Shares.

                  (a)      Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate
its stock transfer agent or such other bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange
Agent"). Prior to Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with or for the account
of the Exchange Agent stock certificates representing the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, which shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been


                                       3
<PAGE>

issued at the Effective Time and which certificates shall be returned to Parent
if such Effective Time does not occur.

                  (b)      As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but
not later than the first business day after the Effective Time), Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") that were
converted pursuant to Section 1.6 into the right to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock (i) a form of letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 1 and (y) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.9,
after giving effect to any required tax withholdings, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares
of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender a certificate representing shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by this Article 1. In no event will the holder of any such
surrendered Certificate be entitled to receive interest on any cash to be
received in lieu of fractional shares.

                  (c)      If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue the
corresponding Parent Common Stock in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.

         Section 1.8       Dividends; Transfer Taxes; Withholdings; Escheat. No
dividends or distributions that are declared on shares of Parent Common Stock
after the Effective Time will be paid to persons entitled to receive
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock until such persons
surrender their Certificates. Subject to applicable law, upon such surrender,
there shall be paid, to the person in whose name the certificates representing
such shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, any dividends or
distributions with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock which have a
record date after the Effective Time and shall have


                                       4
<PAGE>

become payable between the Effective Time and the time of such surrender. In no
event shall the person entitled to receive such dividends or distributions be
entitled to receive interest thereon. As soon as practicable following the date
which is six months after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to the Surviving Corporation all cash, certificates and other documents in its
possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 1 shall look thereafter only to the Surviving Corporation for the
shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions thereon, and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof to which they are entitled pursuant
to this Article 1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Common Stock for
any shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions thereon or
any cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws upon the
lapse of the applicable time periods provided for therein. Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Certificate
such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the Certificate in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent.

         Section 1.9       No Fractional Securities. No certificates or scrip
representing less than one whole share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu of any such fractional share, each holder
of record of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to
such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on
behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to this Section 1.9. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (a) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over
(b) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be
distributed to such holders (such excess being herein called the "Excess
Shares"), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders, shall sell the
Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the
"NYSE"). The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed
on the NYSE through one or more members firms of the NYSE and shall be executed
in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use its best
efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agent's sole judgment, is practicable
consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of
prevailing market conditions. Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and
compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of
the Excess Shares. Until the net proceeds of such sale have been distributed to
such holders, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such
holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash
to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with
this Agreement such


                                       5

amounts to such holders. The fractional Parent Common Stock interests of each
such holder will be aggregated, and no such holder will receive cash in an
amount equal to or greater than the value of one whole share of Parent Common
Stock.

         Section 1.10      No Further Rights; Closing of Company Transfer Books.
All shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Article 1 shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the corresponding shares of Company Common Stock, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make
any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which
may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of
this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made on such stock
transfer books. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article 1; provided, however, if any Certificate has not been surrendered prior
to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 1.8 in respect of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Government), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.

         Section 1.11      Further Assurances. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things
are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of either of Sub or the Company acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of each of Sub and the Company or otherwise, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in such names and
on such behalf or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

         Section 1.12      Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld
LLP, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, at 10:00 a.m., on the
next business day after the date on which all of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 are satisfied or waived or on such other date and at such other time

                                  ARTICLE 2.
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as
follows, subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter:

         Section 2.1       Organization and Qualification.

                  (a)      The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
the requisite corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental
franchises and Permits (as defined in Section 2.14 hereof) necessary to enable
it to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to possess such
franchises and Permits has not had and would not be reasonably expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.11 hereof). The
Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 2.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of the jurisdictions in which the
Company is qualified to do business.

                  (b)      The only subsidiaries of the Company are those set
forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Each subsidiary of
the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the
requisite corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental
franchises and Permits necessary to enable it to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to possess such franchises and Permits has
not had and would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (c)      All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
each such subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable and, except as set forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, are owned by the Company, by another wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company or by the Company and another such wholly owned subsidiary, free
and clear of all pledges, claims, equities, options, liens, charges, rights of
first refusal, "tag" or "drag" along rights, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"). Except for
the capital stock of its subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest in or security of any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other
entity. The Company has delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of its
Certificate of Incorporation and


                                       7

Bylaws, each as amended to date and each of which is in full force and effect.
The Company is not in violation of any of these documents.

                  (a)      The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred

and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock have
been duly authorized and all of the shares of Company Common Stock have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to
preemptive rights. As of June 30, 2003, 19,251,749 shares of Company Common
Stock were issued and outstanding, 2,188,484 shares of Company Common Stock
were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Stock Options issued
under the Company's Amended and Restated 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
"Stock Option Plan") and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding. Such shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under
the Stock Option Plan have not been issued and will not be issued prior to the
Effective Time, and no commitment has been or will be made for their issuance,
other than under the Company Stock Options described in the preceding sentence
and issued and outstanding under the Stock Option Plan as of the date of this
Agreement. Except as described in this Section 2.2(a) or as set forth in
Section 2.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter: (i) there are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote
(or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote)
on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote ("Voting Company
Debt"); (ii) no shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the
Company are authorized and there are no outstanding securities, options,
warrants, calls, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom"
stock rights, SARs, stock-based performance units, commitments, agreements,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound obligating the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
security, option, warrant, call, right, unit, commitment, agreement,
arrangement or undertaking; (iii) there are not any outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, or providing preemptive rights with respect to, any shares
of, or any outstanding options, warrants or rights of any kind to acquire any
shares of, or any outstanding securities that are convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of, capital stock of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; and (iv) there are no dividends accrued or declared, but not
paid, in respect of any of the capital stock of the Company.

                  (b)      Except as set forth in Section 2.2(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements,
commitments or understandings of any character to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or with respect to the registration of the

                  (c)      Section 2.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list of: (i) all the holders of Company Stock Options; (ii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock to which the Company Stock Options are
applicable; and (iii) the exercise price, date of grant, duration and vesting
schedule for each Company Stock Option. Except as set forth in Section 2.2(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company Stock Options will
accelerate or vest upon the Company's entering into this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 2.3       Authority Relative to this Agreement.

                  (a)      The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, the ancillary agreements
hereto and each instrument required hereby to be executed and delivered by the
Company prior to or at the Effective Time, to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (subject
to the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 2.3(b) below) with
respect to the Merger). The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
ancillary agreements hereto and each instrument required hereby to be executed
and delivered by the Company prior to or at the Effective Time and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the
Company Stockholder Approval and the filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement and the ancillary
agreements hereto executed on the date hereof have been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company, and, assuming this Agreement and the
ancillary agreements hereto constitute valid and binding agreements of Parent
and Sub, the Agreement and the ancillary agreements hereto executed on the date
hereof constitute, and the ancillary agreements to be executed at the closing
when executed will constitute valid and binding agreements of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability may be subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other law relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally and (ii) general principles of equity (whether in a proceeding at law
or in equity).

                  (b)      The only vote of holders of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries necessary to adopt or
approve this Agreement and the Merger is the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Stockholder Approval"). The affirmative vote of the holders of any
capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or
any of them, is not necessary to consummate the Merger other than as set forth
in the preceding sentence.

         Section 2.4       Absence of Certain Changes. Except as specifically
disclosed in the Company's filings and reports under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") filed and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in Section 2.4 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, from January 1, 2003 through the date hereof, the Company
and its subsidiaries have conducted their business and operations only in the


                                       9

ordinary course consistent with past practice, and during such period there has
not been any event, change, effect or development that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and there has not occurred (i) any damage, destruction
or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) having or which reasonably could
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend
or distribution of any kind by the Company on any class of its capital stock or
any repurchase for value by the Company of any of its capital stock (except
upon the cashless exercise of Company Stock Options); (iii) any split,
combination or reclassification of any Company capital stock or any issuance or
the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in
lieu of or in substitution for shares of Company capital stock; (iv) any
material increase in the compensation payable or to become payable by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to any of its directors, officers or key
employees or the creation of or any material increase in any bonus, insurance,
pension, severance or other employee benefit plan, payment or arrangement made
to, for or with any such director, officer or key employee, other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (v) any entry by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries into any commitment or transaction
(including, without limitation, any borrowing or capital expenditure) material
(individually or in the aggregate) to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
other than in the ordinary course of business; (vi) any material elections with
respect to Taxes by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or settlement or
compromise by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any material Tax
liability or refund; (vii) any change by the Company or its subsidiaries in
accounting methods, principles or practices except as required by concurrent
changes in GAAP; (viii) any contract or agreement to take any action described
in this Section 2.4; or (ix) any merger, combination or consolidation of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries with another person, or any sale, lease,
exchange or other disposition of, or grant of any Lien with respect to, any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that are
individually or in the aggregate, material to the business of the Company and
its subsidiaries, except for dispositions of excess or obsolete assets in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice.

         Section 2.5       Reports and Financial Statements.

                  (a)      Since May 26, 1998, the date of its initial public
offering, the Company has filed all required forms, reports and documents with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") required to be filed by it
pursuant to the federal securities laws and the SEC rules and regulations
thereunder (collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"), all of which have
complied as of their respective filing dates, or, if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment, in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules
promulgated thereunder. None of such forms, reports or documents at the time
filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements


                                      10
<PAGE>

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Except to the extent information contained in any Company SEC
Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed Company SEC Document,
none of the Company SEC Documents (including any and all financial statements
included therein) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Documents (including the notes thereto) at the time filed
complied in all material respects as to form with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and in Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation) and fairly
present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (and include, in the case
of any unaudited interim financial statements, reasonable accruals for normal
year-end adjustments). No subsidiaries of the Company are required to file
periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act.

                  (b)      Since May 26, 1998, the Company and its subsidiaries
have filed all reports required to be filed with any Governmental Entity (as
hereafter defined) other than the SEC, including state securities
administrators, except where the failure to file any such reports of the
Company and its subsidiaries has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Such reports of the Company and its
subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with the requirements of applicable
law, except where the failure to prepare any such reports in accordance with
the requirements of applicable law has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 2.6       Information in Joint Proxy Statement and Registration
Statement. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
to be filed with the SEC by Parent on Form S-4 under the Securities Act for the
purpose of registering the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger (the "Registration Statement") or (ii) the joint
proxy statement/prospectus to be distributed in connection with the Company's
and Parent's respective meetings of stockholders to vote in connection with
this Agreement (the "Proxy Statement") will, in the case of the Registration
Statement, at the time it becomes effective and at the Effective Time, or, in
the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and any amendments
or supplements thereto, and at the time of the respective meetings of
stockholders of the Company and Parent to be held in connection with the
Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. As of the date of its initial mailing and as of the date of the
respective meetings of stockholders of the Company and Parent, the Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect
to statements made therein based on information supplied by Parent or its
representatives for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or with respect to
information concerning Parent or any of its subsidiaries incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

use of any license, patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, logo,
copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right is pending, or to the
knowledge of the Company threatened.

                  (d)      Any software proprietary to the Company or any of

time they were employed by the Company or its subsidiaries or independent
contractors under a written nondisclosure agreement or a
work-for-hire/assignment agreement, and all rights arising from the work of
such employees and independent contractors in respect of such software are
owned by the Company or its subsidiaries. The software developed by the

of the Parent and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with the
requirements of applicable law, except where the failure to prepare any such
reports in accordance with the requirements of applicable law has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

substitution for, shares of such capital stock or such equity interests, or
declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution payable in cash,
stock or property of any class of its capital stock;

                  (e)      offer, sell, issue or grant, or authorize or propose
the offering, sale, issuance or grant of, any shares of capital stock of, or

than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock upon the exercise of the
Company Stock Options outstanding at the date of this Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof (as in effect on the date of this Agreement);

person or (ii) acquire or agree to acquire, by merging or consolidating with,
by purchasing an equity interest in or a portion of the assets of, or in any

with past practice;

                  (h)      propose or adopt any amendments to its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents;

                  (i)      effect any change in any accounting methods,
principles or practices in effect as of December 31, 2002 affecting the
reported consolidated assets, liabilities, results of operations, cash flow or
stockholders' equity of the Company, except as may be specifically required by
a change in generally accepted accounting principles;

                  (j)      (i) incur, guaranty, assume or prepay any

business (except that the Company shall not exercise its rights under Section
2(a)(iii) of the Company Credit Agreement) and to enter into the Loan Agreement
as borrower under the Parent Loan and (b) at such time as the Board of
Directors of the Company in its reasonable judgment shall determine, the
Company may engage in conversations and negotiations related to refinancing the
Company Credit Agreement, and in the event that the Effective Time does not
occur by January 22, 2004, then the Company may refinance, and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate such refinancing, its Company
Credit Agreement with the proceeds of indebtedness incurred by the Company
(which may be secured by a Lien on assets of the Company), the terms of which
are reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided however, that Parent's efforts
to refinance the Company's indebtedness in connection


                                      32
<PAGE>

with the Merger shall not be deemed inconsistent with the exercise of such

                  (q)      agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the
foregoing actions.

         Section 4.3       Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger.
Parent hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, unless
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement or consented to in writing
by the Company, it will not (i) amend its Certificate of Incorporation or

outstanding capital stock; (iii) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or
other distribution payable in cash, stock or property; or (iv) acquire (by
merger, consolidation or acquisition of stock or assets) any corporation,
partnership or business unit thereof or any equity interest therein if such
acquisition would be deemed to be a significant acquisition as defined in Rule
11-01(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.

         Section 4.4       Conduct of Business of Sub. During the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Sub shall not engage in any
activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement. It is understood that Sub was formed by Parent solely for the
purpose of effecting the Merger, and that Sub will have no material assets and

                                   ARTICLE 5.
                                    COVENANTS

         Section 5.1       No Solicitation.

                  (a)      The Company agrees that it shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and
communications with any third parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
(as defined in Section 5.1(e) below). From and after the date hereof until the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1, the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives, agents or affiliates (including, without limitation,
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries) (collectively, "Representatives") shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including, without
limitation, by way of furnishing information), or take any action designed to
facilitate the making of, any offer or proposal which constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any
agreement regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in negotiations
or discussions with, or provide any information or data to, any person (other
than Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives)
regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal, or
otherwise encourage any effort or attempt by any person to do or seek any of the
foregoing. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any person of the
Company's Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so authorized
and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company (i) may
permit any person who expresses an Acquisition Proposal Interest to make an
Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company, notwithstanding
the existence of a standstill obligation which would otherwise restrict the
person from making such Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of the
Company, if the Board of Directors of the Company with the advice of independent
counsel (who may be the Company's regularly engaged independent counsel)
determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable
law, (ii) may furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets
to any person pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement dated May 15, 2002, entered into between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") if, and only if, such person has on an unsolicited
basis, and in the absence of any violation of this Section 5.1 by the Company or
any of its Representatives, submitted an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Proposal Interest that constitutes or, that in the good faith opinion of the
Company Board of Directors, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal and (iii) may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations
with such person concerning an Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, (x) such
person has on an unsolicited basis, and in the absence of any violation of this
Section 5.1 by the Company or any of its Representatives, submitted a bona fide
written Superior Proposal to the Company and (y) in the good faith opinion of
the Company Board of Directors, only after consultation with independent outside
legal counsel to the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined that engaging in such


                                       34
<PAGE>

discussions or negotiations is in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and the failure to engage in such discussions or negotiations would
be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders
under applicable law. A "Superior Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal that
is not conditioned upon the ability to obtain financing (A) which is for not
less than eighty percent (80%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or eighty percent (80%) of the consolidated assets of the Company
and (B) which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with a nationally recognized investment banking firm, is (I)
superior to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view and,
taking into account relevant legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and any other factors that the Company Board of Directors determines to
be relevant, the identity of the third party making such proposal, and the
conditions for completion of such proposal, a more favorable transaction than
the Merger and (II) reasonably likely to be completed. The Company shall
promptly, and in any event within twenty-four hours following receipt by the
Company or any of its Representatives of an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
or expression of interest relating to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Proposal Interest (as defined below) and prior to providing any such party from
whom an Acquisition Proposal has been received with any material non-public
information, notify Parent of the receipt of the same. The Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any material non-public information regarding the
Company provided to any other party which was not previously provided to Parent,
such additional information to be provided no later than the next business day
after the date of provision of such information to such other party.

                  (c)      Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.1(c),
neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or to Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or take any action
or make any statement inconsistent with such approval, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a "Change in the
Company's Recommendation"), or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle or agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board of Directors, subject to the
terms of this and the following two sentences, to the extent that it determines
in good faith, after consultation with independent outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to
the Company's stockholders under applicable law, may make a Change in the
Company's Recommendation. The Company may make a Change in the Company's
Recommendation (A) at a time that is after the third day following the Company's
delivery to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of
Directors has determined that it has received a Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the
Person making such Superior Proposal and indicating that it intends to make a
Change in the Company's Recommendation and (B) if, during such three (3) day
period, the Company and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.
Any such Change in the Company's Recommendation shall not change the approval of
the Company Board of Directors for purposes


                                       35
<PAGE>

of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable and
the transactions contemplated thereby.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Section 5.1 or any other provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company's
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to do so would inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable law; provided, however, that the Company
Board of Directors shall not in any case make a Change in the Company's
Recommendation except in accordance with Section 5.1(c).

                  (e)      The Company shall promptly notify Parent if any
proposals are received by, any information is requested from, or any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives,
in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter
defined) or the possibility or consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal
("Acquisition Proposal Interest") indicating, in connection with such notice,
the name of the Person initiating such Acquisition Proposal Interest, and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers. The Company agrees
that it shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms
of any Acquisition Proposal Interest. As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition
Proposal" means any tender or exchange offer involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any proposal or
offer to acquire in any manner an interest in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of
the outstanding equity securities, or a substantial portion of the business or
assets of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than assets or
inventory in the ordinary course of business or assets held for sale), any
proposal or offer with respect to any recapitalization or restructuring with
respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any proposal or offer with
respect to any other transaction similar to any of the foregoing with respect to
the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than pursuant to the Merger.

         Section 5.2       Access to Information. Each of the Company and Parent
shall (and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to) afford to the other and to the
other's officers, employees, financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants,
consultants and other representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours throughout the period from the date hereof until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, to all of its books and
records and its properties, plants and personnel and, during such period, each
shall furnish promptly to the other a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws, provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2
shall affect any representations or warranties made herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the Merger. Unless
otherwise required by law, each of Parent and the Company agrees that it (and
its respective subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives) shall
hold in confidence all non-public information so acquired in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below).


                                       36
<PAGE>

         Section 5.3       Confidentiality Agreements. The parties agree that
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements dated May 15, 2002 between
Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreements") shall remain binding
and in full force and effect; provided, however, that any consents from the
Company necessary under the Confidentiality Agreements for Parent and Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to have been
made and provided that the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements relating
to standstill obligations shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
after the date hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall, within two (2) business days of request therefor, provide to
Parent the information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act
and any information to which a holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled
under Section 220 of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such
section).

         Section 5.4       Registration Statement and Proxy Statement. As
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall in consultation with each other prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement and Parent in consultation with the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective as soon as practicable after the date hereof. Parent shall also use
its reasonable efforts to take any action required to be taken under state
securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of the shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement in the Merger. The Company shall
furnish Parent with all information concerning the Company and the holders of
its capital stock and shall take such other action as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement
and the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall furnish the
Company with all information concerning Parent and the holders of its capital
stock and shall take such other action as the Company may reasonably request in
connection with the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any event or circumstance relating to Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, the
Company, any subsidiary of the Company, or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by such party which should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, such
party shall promptly inform the other thereof and take appropriate action in
respect thereof. Each of the parties hereto shall cause the Proxy Statement to
comply as to form and substance, as to such party, in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act,
(iii) the rules and regulations of the Exchange. No amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement shall be made without the
approval of Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the consent of Parent shall not be
required to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement to reflect the withdrawal of
the recommendation of Company's Board of Directors that Company's stockholders
vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and/or the recommendation that
Company's stockholders approve a Superior Proposal. Each of the parties hereto
shall advise the other parties hereto, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, of
the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy


                                       37
<PAGE>

Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.

         Section 5.5       Proxy Statement; Stockholder Approvals.

                  (a)      The Company, acting through its Board of Directors,

incorporation and by-laws, promptly and duly call, give notice of and, as soon
as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes
effective, hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock for the purpose
of voting to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting"), and, subject to Section 5.1, (i)
recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, by the stockholders of the Company and include in the Proxy
Statement such recommendation and (ii) take all reasonable and lawful action to
solicit and obtain such approval.

                  (b)      Parent, acting through its Board of Directors, shall,
subject to and in accordance with applicable law and its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, promptly and duly call, give notice of and, as soon
as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes
effective, hold a meeting of the holders of Parent Common Stock for the purpose
of voting to approve the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to the
stockholders of the Company upon the Merger, and (i) recommend approval by the
stockholders of Parent and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation
and (ii) take all reasonable and lawful action to solicit and obtain such
approval.

                  (c)      The Company and the Parent, as promptly as
practicable, shall each cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to
their respective stockholders.

                  (d)      At or prior to the Closing, (i) the Company shall
deliver to Parent a certificate of its Secretary setting forth the voting
results from its stockholder meeting and (ii) Parent shall deliver to the
Company a certificate of its Secretary setting forth the voting results from its
stockholder meeting.

                  (e)      None of the information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement shall, at the respective times filed with the SEC or other
regulatory agency, and, in addition, (i) in the case of the Proxy Statement, at
the date it or any amendments or supplements thereto are mailed to stockholders
of Company, at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting and at the
Effective Time and (ii) in the case of the Registration Statement, when it
becomes effective under the Securities Act and at the Effective Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
circumstances relating to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. All
documents that Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with
the Merger will comply as to


                                       38
<PAGE>

form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the rules and
regulations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

                  (f)      None of the information supplied by Parent for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement shall, at the respective times filed with the SEC or other
regulatory agency and, in addition, (i) in the case of the Proxy Statement, at
the date it or any amendments or supplements thereto are mailed to stockholders
of the Company, at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting and at the
Effective Time and (ii) in the case of the Registration Statement, when it
becomes effective under the Securities Act and at the Effective Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or
circumstance relating to Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, or their respective
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent that should be set forth
in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company. All documents that Parent
is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
rules and regulations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

         Section 5.6       Compliance with the Securities Act.

                  (a)      At least 10 days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent a list identifying all persons who
were at the record date for its stockholders' meeting convened in accordance
with Section 5.5, "affiliates" of the Company, as that term is used in
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145
Affiliates").

                  (b)      The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each person who is identified as one of its Rule 145 Affiliates in its
list referred to in Section 5.6(a) to deliver to Parent (with a copy to the
Company), prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit 5.6(b) (the "Affiliate Agreement").

                  (c)      Parent shall be entitled to place legends, as
specified in the Affiliate Agreement, on the certificates evidencing any of the
Parent Common Stock to be received by (a) any Rule 145 Affiliates or (b) any
person Parent reasonably identifies, after consultation with outside counsel (by
written notice to Company), as being a person who would be deemed a Rule 145
Affiliate, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer
agent for such Parent Common Stock, consistent with the terms of the Affiliate
Agreement, regardless of whether such person has executed an Affiliate Agreement
and regardless of whether such person's name appears on such list delivered by
the Company.

         Section 5.7       Reasonable Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article 6 are satisfied
and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the obtaining of all necessary
waivers, consents and approvals and


                                       39
<PAGE>

the effecting of all necessary registrations and filings; provided, however,
that the Company shall not, without Parent's prior written consent, and Parent
shall not be required to, divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to
take any other similar action with respect to any assets, businesses or product
lines of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, as promptly as practicable, the Company, Parent and Sub shall
make all filings and submissions under the HSR Act as may be reasonably required
to be made in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreements, the Company will furnish to
Parent and Sub, and Parent and Sub will furnish to the Company, such information
and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any such filings or submissions. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreements, the Company will provide Parent and Sub, and Parent and Sub will
provide the Company, with copies of all material written correspondence, filings
and communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
such party or any of its representatives and any Governmental Entity, with
respect to the obtaining of any waivers, consent or approvals and the making of
any registrations or filings, in each case that is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In case at any time after
the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers or directors of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall take all such necessary action. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company's Board of
Directors shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated thereby and (ii) if a state takeover statute or similar
law becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
thereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and such other
transaction may be consummated, as promptly as practicable, on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (b)      Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to obtain the necessary
waivers, consents and approvals described in Section 5.19(f) prior to September
8, 2003; provided, however, that the Company shall not, without Parent's prior
written consent divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
other similar action with respect to any assets, businesses or product lines of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

         Section 5.8       Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each of
the Company Stock Options (and, solely with respect to such options, the Stock
Option Plan if required in accordance with Section 5.8(c) below) listed on
Section 2.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be assumed by Parent on
the terms set forth herein and converted automatically into an option to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a "Converted Option") in an amount
and at an exercise price determined as provided below:

                  (a)      The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
subject to a Converted Option shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock remaining subject (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) to the original option and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded down to the nearest share; and


                                       40
<PAGE>

                  (b)      The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
under a Converted Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under the original option divided by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.

                  (c)      At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall
either cause to be effected any amendments to the Parent Plans or assume the
Stock Option Plan in order to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.8.

After the Effective Time, each Converted Option shall be exercisable, shall vest
and shall terminate upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that all references to the Company Common Stock shall be deemed to be references
to Parent Common Stock. Within 15 days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate
form) and shall take any action required to be taken under state securities
"blue sky" laws for purposes of registering all shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable after the Effective Time upon exercise of the Converted Options, and
use all reasonable efforts to have such registration statement (or a successor
or replacement registration statement) become effective with respect thereto as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and to remain in effect while
any of the Converted Options remain exercisable. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
in connection with the exercise of Converted Options such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock as shall be required to be issued upon such exercise.

         Section 5.9       Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

                  (a)      Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect for the benefit of individuals who at or prior to the
Effective Time were directors, officers or agents of the Company or the
subsidiaries of the Company the current provisions regarding indemnification and
exculpation of officers, directors and agents of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (including with respect to advancement expense) contained in the
respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or agreements listed on Section
2.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a period of
six years from the Effective Time, except to make changes permitted by
applicable law that would enlarge the exculpation or indemnification thereunder.
Parent shall cause to be maintained, if available, for a period of six years
from the Effective Time the Company's current directors' and officers' insurance
and indemnification policy and fiduciary liability policy (the "D&O Insurance")
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor, at its election, policies or
financial guarantees with the same carriers or other reputable and financially
sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous than the existing D&O Insurance) to
the extent that such insurance policies provide coverage for events occurring
prior to the Effective Time for all persons who are directors and officers of
the Company on the date of this Agreement (or were prior to the date of this
Agreement), so long as the annual premium to be paid by the Company after the
date of this Agreement for such D&O Insurance during such six-year period would
not exceed 300% of the annual premium as of the date of this Agreement. If,
during such six-year period, such insurance


                                       41
<PAGE>

coverage cannot be obtained at all or can only be obtained for an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premium therefor as of the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause insurance coverage to be
obtained for an amount equal to 300% of the current annual premium therefor, on
terms and conditions substantially similar to the existing D&O Insurance.

                  (b)      If any claim or claims shall, subsequent to the
Effective Time and within six years thereafter, be made in writing against any
present or former director or officer of the Company based on or arising out of
the services of such person at or prior to the Effective Time in the capacity of
such person as a director or officer of the Company (and such director or
officer shall have given Parent written notice of such claim or claims within
such six year period), the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section
respecting the obligation to indemnify the current or former directors or
officers under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and
its subsidiaries shall continue in effect until the final disposition of all
such claims.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.9, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected without its written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

                  (d)      The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each person entitled to indemnification hereunder and the heirs
and representatives of such person.

                  (e)      Parent will not, nor will Parent permit the Surviving
Corporation to, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell all or
substantially all of Parent's or such subsidiary's assets unless Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation will ensure that the surviving or resulting entity
assumes the obligations imposed by this Section 5.9.

         Section 5.10      Employment Arrangements; Employee Plans and Benefits.

                  (a)      Employment Arrangements and Accrued Benefits. From
and after the date hereof, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall honor in accordance with their terms (i) all existing
employment, severance, consulting, change of control and indemnification
agreements and other bonus and compensation arrangements between the Company or
any of its subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director or employee
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) with respect to all
employees, officers and directors of the Company, all benefits or other amounts
earned or accrued through the Effective Time under the Benefit Plans disclosed
in Schedule 2.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (or not required to be
disclosed in such schedule).

                  (b)      Post-Closing Benefits. For a period of not less than
one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain a compensation structure and benefit plans for employees
of the Company who remain employees of the Surviving Corporation ("Transferred
Employees") with terms that, in the aggregate for each employee, are
substantially comparable to the compensation structure and Benefit Plans
currently in place for such employees. With respect to any benefits plans of
Parent or its subsidiaries in


                                       42
<PAGE>

which the Transferred Employees participate after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts
to: (i) waive any limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees under any benefit plan in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time (provided,
however, that no such waiver shall apply to a pre-existing condition of any
Transferred Employee who was, as of the Effective Time, excluded from
participation in a Company benefit plan by nature of such pre-existing
condition), (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time during the year in
which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any benefit plan in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and (iii) recognize all
service of the Transferred Employees with the Company for all purposes
(including without limitation purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
credit, entitlement for benefits, and benefit accrual) in any benefit plan in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
except to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative accrual of
benefits for the same period of service.

                  (c)      No Right to Employment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee of
the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any of the Company's subsidiaries any right
with respect to employment by the Parent, the Sub or any of the Parent's
subsidiaries or affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right
of Parent, the Sub or any of the Parent's subsidiaries or affiliates to
terminate the employment of any such employee at anytime, with or without cause,
or, except as provided in Sections 5.10(a) or (b), restrict Parent, the Sub or
any of the Parent's subsidiaries or affiliates in the exercise of their
independent business judgment in modifying any other terms and conditions of the
employment of any such employee.

         Section 5.11      Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall to
the fullest extent practicable consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by law or any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.

         Section 5.12      Listing Application. Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Agreement in the Merger (as well as the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable after the Effective Time upon exercise of the Parent Options) to be
listed for quotation and trading on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the
Effective Time.

         Section 5.13      Supplemental Disclosure. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause (x) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (y) any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied
with or satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or


                                       43
<PAGE>

satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.13 shall not have any effect for the purpose of determining the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 6 of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

         Section 5.14      Letters of Accountants.

                  (a)      Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be delivered to the Company a letter of Ernst & Young LLP, Parent's
independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before the date on
which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to the
Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement, which letter shall be brought down to a date within two
business days prior to the Effective Time.

                  (b)      The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's
independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before the date on
which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to Parent,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope
and substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement,
which letter shall be brought down to a date within two business days prior to
the Effective Time.

         Section 5.15      Recruitment. Prior to the Effective Time, and, if
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(i), prior
to the first anniversary of the date of such termination, neither Parent nor any
of its subsidiaries shall hire or solicit the employment of any employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. Prior to the Effective Time and, if this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(i) or 7.1(e)(ii)
prior to the first anniversary of such termination, neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries shall hire or solicit the employment of any employee of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries. If this Agreement terminates without the
Merger being consummated except as provided in the preceding sentence of this
Section 5.15, neither Parent nor its subsidiaries, on the one hand, nor the
Company nor its subsidiaries, on the other, will hire or solicit the employment
of any employee of any of the others, for a period of six months from the date
of such termination.

         Section 5.16      Rights Agreement. At the election of the Parent or
Sub, the Company will redeem the Rights prior to the Closing Date.

         Section 5.17      Section 16(b) Board Approval.

                  (a)      Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of Parent shall, by resolution duly adopted by such Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee of "non-employee directors" thereof, approve and adopt, for
purposes of exemption from "short-swing" liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act, the acquisition of Parent Common Stock at the Effective Time by
officers or directors of the Company who become, prior to, at, or following the
Effective Time of the Merger, officers or directors of Parent as a result of the
conversion of


                                       44
<PAGE>

shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger and the assumption of the Company
Stock Options by Parent at the Effective Time. Such resolution shall set forth
the name of the applicable "insiders" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, the number of securities to be acquired by each individual, that the
approval is being granted to exempt the transaction under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act, and, for the Company Stock Options to be assumed by Parent at the
Effective Time, the material terms of the Company Stock Options to purchase
Parent Common Stock acquired by such insiders as a result of the assumption by
Parent of such Company Stock Options.

                  (b)      Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall, by resolution duly adopted by such Board of Directors or a
duly authorized committee of "non-employee directors" thereof, approve and
adopt, for purposes of exemption from "short-swing" liability under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act, the conversion at the Effective Time of the shares of
the Company Common Stock held by officers and directors of the Company into

Stock to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock at the Effective Time,
the number and material terms of the Company Stock Options to be assumed by
Parent at the Effective Time, and that the approval is being granted to exempt
the transaction under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

         Section 5.18      Employment Agreements. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause James S. Olin, John W.

deliver to Parent employment agreements substantially in the forms attached
hereto as Exhibits 5.18(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), respectively.

         Section 5.19      Parent Loan. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof and following fulfillment of the conditions described in this Section
5.19, Parent and/or Sub shall make available to the Company a revolving line of

pursuant to the terms and conditions of a loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement")
to be entered into by the Company, Parent and/or Sub, which Loan Agreement shall
contain the following terms and conditions in addition to other reasonable and
customary terms and conditions:

                  (a)      the Parent Loan shall mature on the earliest to occur
of: (i) the Effective Time; (ii) an event of default under the Loan Agreement;
(iii) termination of this Agreement; or (iv) August 4, 2005, and the Parent Loan
shall be subordinated to the Company's Senior Notes and indebtedness outstanding
under the Company Credit Agreement and be unsecured;

                  (b)      proceeds of the Parent Loan will be used by the
Company for general working capital purposes and not for any other purpose,
including the repayment of Company debt;


                                       45
<PAGE>

                  (c)      events of default under the Loan Agreement shall
include, among other customary provisions: (i) failure by the Company to pay any
principal, interest or cost due under the Loan Agreement within three (3)

under this Agreement or the Loan Agreement, which failure is not cured within
ten (10) days after notice from Parent and/or Sub or discovery or knowledge
thereof by the Company;

                  (d)      interest under the Parent Loan prior to an event of
default shall accrue at the rate of ten and one-half percent (10.5%) per annum;
in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or
7.1(e) hereof, then the entire amount of interest which would accrue from the
date of advances under the Parent Loan through August 4, 2005 shall be due and
payable together with all other amounts due at maturity;

                  (e)      Parent and/or Sub shall be required to make advances
under the Parent Loan only if (among other customary conditions): no event of
default has occurred; and all representations and warranties of the Company in
the Loan Agreement and this Agreement shall be, and shall have been when made,
true and correct in all material respects; and

                  (f)      Parent's and/or Sub's obligation to enter into the

to the Company; (ii) the use of proceeds of the Parent Loan for working capital
by the Company and not for the repayment of Company debt; and (iii) the waiver
of events of default or change of control payments occasioned by the execution
and consummation of this Agreement and the waiver of compliance with any
financial covenants which the Company believes will likely be breached under the
Company Senior Notes, the Company Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement or the
Company Credit Agreement prior to the Effective Time.

                         TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

         Section 7.1       Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at
any time (notwithstanding approval thereof by the stockholders of the Company or
the Parent) prior to the Effective Time:

                  (a)      by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

                  (b)      by either Parent or the Company, if (i) the Merger
shall not have been consummated before May 31, 2004, provided that a party may
not terminate pursuant to clause (i) if such party's failure to satisfy its
obligations under the Agreement shall be the principal reason that Effective
Time has not occurred before such date, or (ii) the Company Stockholder Approval
shall not have been obtained at a meeting duly convened therefor or any
adjournment thereof or (iii) the Parent Stockholders Approval shall not have
been obtained at a meeting duly convened therefor or any adjournment thereof
(unless, in the case of any such termination pursuant to this Section 7.1(b),
the failure to so consummate the Merger by such date or to obtain such
stockholder approval shall have been caused by the action or failure to act of
the party (or its subsidiaries) seeking to terminate this Agreement, which
action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement);

                  (c)      by Parent or the Company if any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued a final order,
decree or ruling or taken any other final


                                       50
<PAGE>

action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger and such order, decree or ruling or other action is or shall have become
nonappealable;

                  (d)      by the Company, concurrently with the execution of an
Acquisition Agreement under the circumstances permitted by Section 5.1 in
connection with a Superior Proposal provided that the Company pays the
termination fee and other amounts due under Section 7.3(b) as a condition
precedent to such termination (provided that the Company shall not accept or
resolve to accept a Superior Proposal unless (x) it provides Parent with notice
of the material terms of such proposal at least five (5) days prior to such
acceptance and (y) at the time of such acceptance the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith that such proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any amendments Parent and Sub may have
offered to make to this Agreement); or

                  (e)      by Parent, if (i) there has been a breach of any of
the representations or warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, which breach is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given by
Parent to the Company, and such breach individually or collectively has had or
would reasonably likely have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (x) fails to convene
a meeting of the Company's stockholders to approve the Merger on or before 165
days following the date hereof (provided the Registration Statement has been
declared effective within 120 days after the date hereof and if it has not, then
the Company Meeting Date shall mean 45 days following the effective date of the
Registration Statement) (the "Company Meeting Date"), or postpones the date
scheduled for the meeting of the stockholders of the Company to approve this
Agreement beyond the Company Meeting Date, except with the written consent of
Parent, (y) fails to recommend the approval of this Agreement and the Merger to
the Company's stockholders in accordance with Section 5.5(a) hereof or withdraws
or amends or modifies in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation or
approval in respect of this Agreement or the Merger or takes any other action
specified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 5.1(c) hereof or (z) fails,
upon the written request of Parent (which request may be made at any time
following public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal) to reaffirm publicly its
recommendation to the Company's stockholders that they give the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger, which public reaffirmation must also include the
unconditional rejection of such Acquisition Proposal. Such reaffirmation shall
be made at least ten (10) trading days prior to the Company Stockholders'
Meeting, and Company shall delay the Company Stockholders' Meeting to provide
ten (10) trading days if the Parent so requests in writing (in which case Parent
shall be deemed to have consented for purposes of clause (x) above if such delay
extends the Company Meeting Date beyond the period specified therein); or

                  (f)      by the Company, if there has been a breach of any of
the representations or warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parent and Sub
set forth in this Agreement, which breach is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given by
the Company to Sub and such breach individually or collectively has had or would
reasonably likely have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) the Board of
Directors of Parent or any committee thereof fails to convene a meeting of the
Parent's stockholders to approve the Merger on or before 165 days following the
date hereof (provided the Registration Statement has been declared effective
within 120 days after the date hereof and if it has not, then


                                       51
<PAGE>

the Parent Meeting Date shall mean 45 days following the effective date of the
Registration Statement) (the "Parent Meeting Date"), or postpones the date
scheduled for the meeting of the stockholders of Parent to approve this
Agreement beyond the Parent Meeting Date, except with the written consent of the
Company;

                  (g)      by Parent, if the Company has not obtained the
consents described in Section 5.19(f) hereof on or prior to September 8, 2003;
provided, however, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Subsection 7.1(g) if Parent has made the Parent Loan; or

                  (h)      by the Company on or after September 22, 2003, if (i)
the Company has not obtained the consents described in Section 5.19(f) hereof on
or prior to September 8, 2003, (ii) Parent and/or Sub have elected not to make
the Parent Loan to the Company as a result of the failure of the Company to
obtain such consents, and (iii) the Company has otherwise complied with Section
5.7(b) and Section 5.19 hereof.

         Section 7.2       Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this
Agreement, except for the provisions of Sections 5.3, 7.2, 7.3, 8.3 and 8.6,
shall forthwith become void and have no effect. Subject to Section 7.3 below, no
termination of this Agreement shall relieve any party to this Agreement of
liability for breach of this Agreement.

         Section 7.3       Termination Fee.

                  (a)      Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.3, all
fees and expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely and
entirely by the party which has incurred such fees and expenses.

                  (b)      If at any time before the stockholders meeting
described in Section 2.3(b) (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(d), or (ii) the Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(ii) or 7.1(e)(ii) and prior to such termination any third party
shall have made or announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal and
within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company enters into an
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such case, the
Company shall pay to Parent, within one business day following (a) the execution
by the Company of an Acquisition Agreement in the case of (i) above or (b) the
consummation of an Acquisition Proposal in the case of (ii) above, a fee
("Termination Fee"), in cash, equal to $6,000,000; provided, however, that the
Company in no event shall be obligated to pay more than once such Termination
Fee with respect to all such agreements and occurrences and such termination.
Any payment required to be made pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be made to
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent.

                  (c)      If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Sub
pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(i) and the condition does not result from a willful
breach, promptly upon demand the Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub for
their actual reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions


                                       52
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby (the "Expenses"); provided, however, that in no event shall
such Expenses exceed a maximum amount of $1,000,000. Payment of Expenses shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Sub for such a breach.

                  (d)      If this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and the condition does not result from a willful
breach, promptly upon demand Parent shall reimburse the Company for its actual
reasonable documented Expenses; provided, however, that in no event shall such
Expenses exceed a maximum amount of $1,000,000. Payment of Expenses shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company for such a breach.

                  (e)      For purposes of this Section 7.3, "willful breach"
shall mean that one or more representations and warranties of a party is false
or misleading when made and one or more of the persons listed in Section 7.3(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, in the case of a termination pursuant to
Section 7.3(c), or Section 7.3(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 7.3(d), had actual knowledge at or as of
(as applicable) the time of the making thereof of events, facts, circumstances
or conditions not disclosed hereunder which caused such representation(s) and
warrant(ies) to be false or misleading.

         Section 7.4       Amendment. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
this Agreement may be amended by action taken by or on behalf of the respective
Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Sub at any time before or after
approval of this Agreement by the respective stockholders of the Company and
Parent but, after any such stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made that
by law requires the further approval of such stockholders without the approval
of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of all the parties.

         Section 7.5       Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained herein or in any documents, certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the
other parties hereto contained herein; provided that after the approval of the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no extensions or waivers shall be
made that by law require further approval by such stockholders without the
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of any party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

                                   ARTICLE 8.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 8.1       Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any party breaches its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance in such event, in addition to any other remedy
at law or in equity to which such parties may be entitled.

         Section 8.2       Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None
of the representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive after
the Effective Time. This Section 8.2 shall not limit any covenant or agreement
of the parties hereto which by its terms contemplates performance after the
Effective Time.

         Section 8.3       Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) and,
to the extent contemplated in Section 5.3, the Confidentiality Agreements, (a)
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject
matter hereof and (b) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise;
provided that Parent or Sub may assign any of their rights and obligations to
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Sub of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section 8.3 shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

         Section 8.4       Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing (including
