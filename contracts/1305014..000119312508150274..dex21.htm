corporation (" _Sub_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and HERCULES
INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ " and, together with
Parent and Sub, the "parties").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and into the Company, taken together, are
advisable for, fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its
stockholders and, by resolutions duly adopted, has approved and adopted this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, taken together, are advisable for, fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and, by
resolutions duly adopted, has approved and adopted this Agreement and
resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders approve and adopt this
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Sub has approved and adopted this Agreement
and Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, has approved and adopted this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the various representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation in the
Merger, is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving
Corporation_." The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (excluding the Financing) are referred to in this Agreement
collectively as the " _Transactions_."

SECTION 1.02.  _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Squire, Sanders and Dempsey L.L.P., 350 Park
Avenue, New York, New York 10022 at 9:00 a.m. as soon as practicable but in
any event no later than the fifth Business Day (or by January 26, 2009 if the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained between December 19, 2008 and January
19, 2009) following the date upon which all of the conditions set forth in
Article VII are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions
set forth in Article VII shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waived on such fifth Business Day, then the Closing shall
take place on the first Business Day on which all such conditions shall have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."



 

\- 1 - SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by and executed in
accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, and as soon as practicable on or
after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.05.  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective
Time, without any further action on the part of Parent, the Company or Sub,
(a) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "
_Company Certificate_ ") shall be amended and restated so as to read in its
entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement and, as amended, such
Company Certificate shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and (b) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company shall be
amended and restated so as to read in their entirety as set forth on _Exhibit
B_ to this Agreement and, as so amended, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until amended in accordance with (i) the DGCL, (ii)
the provisions of such Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and (iii) the
terms of this Agreement, including the obligations set forth in Section 6.08.

 

SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, (i)
the directors of Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and
(ii) the officers of Sub shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
in each case until the earlier of their resignation or removal, or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

ARTICLE II

_Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations; Exchange of
Certificates_

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value per
share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



 

\- 2 - (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
common stock, no par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ")
that is held by the Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange for such shares.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, but excluding shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and any Appraisal Shares (as
defined below)) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.0930 (the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), of
Parent (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii) $18.60 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with Section 2.02(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained in this Agreement that is based
upon the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as
the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the
holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time as to which the holder of such shares shall have
(i) not voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing, (ii)
properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section
262_ ") as to appraisal rights and (iii) not effectively withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal (each, an " _Appraisal Share_ "), if any, shall not
be converted into the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.01,
but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment,
solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of such
Appraisal Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with Section
262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be  



 

\- 3 -  cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the appraisal value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) any holder
of Appraisal Shares (1) under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance
with the DGCL, fails to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its right to
appraisal under Section 262, (2) fails to establish his entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (3) fails to take any action the
consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his
shares under the DGCL or (B) a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to appraisal under Section 262, then such
holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common
Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to
constitute Appraisal Shares and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Section 2.01. The Company shall give reasonably prompt notice to Parent
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other notices pursuant to
Section 262 received by the Company. Parent shall have the right to
participate with the Company in and, prior to the Effective Time, in
consultation with the Company, direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates; Exchange Procedures_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in
trust for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Stock
Consideration and cash in U.S. dollars an aggregate amount sufficient to pay
the Cash Consideration. In addition, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay
any dividend or other distributions to which such holders may become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(c). All such Parent Common Stock and cash deposited
with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose than as set forth in
this Section 2.02.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), the following: (i)
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be
in customary form and contain customary provisions as reasonably agreed by the
Company and Parent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the  



 

\- 4 -  surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e). Each
holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(i) the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(c), (ii) a certificate or certificates representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), (iii) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and (iv) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.02(b)
may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the transfer, or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(e). No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment
to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), until the surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat,
Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at
the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including
any cash paid pursuant to subsection (c) or (e) of this Section 2.02) shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding  



 

\- 5 -  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e)  _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall be entitled to receive, from the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.02(e), a
cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares representing such holders
proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange
Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale)
(as so reduced, the "proceeds") in one or more transactions of Parent Common
Stock equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to
Section 2.02(a) over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.02(b) (such excess being, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash proceeds in lieu of issuing certificates
or scrip for fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates
representing Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then-
prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") in the manner
provided in this Section 2.02(e). The sale of the Excess Shares by the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders that would otherwise receive
fractional shares, shall be executed on the NYSE at then-prevailing market
prices and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until
the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, or the Exchange Fund is terminated, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Fractional Share Proceeds_
"). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Fractional Share
Proceeds to which each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds
comprising the Fractional Share Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of shares
of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of
which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all
holders of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the Fractional Share Proceeds) that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Common Stock for 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common
Stock who has not exchanged his shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with this Article II prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for delivery of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II.



 

\- 6 - (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates immediately prior to such date
on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent in obligations of the United
States. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under
any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect of which Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such
deduction or withholding.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

SECTION 3.10. _ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments_.

ERISA, (i) all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "))
(" _Company Pension Plans_ "), (ii) all "employee welfare benefit plans" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and (iii) all other bonus, pension, profit
sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership,
stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, severance,
disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plans,
arrangements or understandings providing benefits to any current or former
directors, officers, employees or consultants of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any employment, consulting, indemnification, severance or
termination agreements or arrangements between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any current or former directors, officers, employees or
consultants of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Company Benefit Plans shall not include any Foreign Benefit Plan or any
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is contributing to or has
contributed  



 

\- 17 -  to (a " _Company Multiemployer Pension Plan_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ " shall refer to each plan,
program or contract that is subject to or governed by the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States, and that would have been treated as
a Company Benefit Plan had it been a United States plan, program or
contract. Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of
each material Company Benefit Plan, each material Company Multiemployer
Pension Plan and each material Foreign Benefit Plan. The Company has made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (i) each material
Company Benefit Plan and material Foreign Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any
unwritten material Company Benefit Plan or any unwritten material Foreign
Benefit Plan, a description thereof), (ii) the most recent annual report on
Form 5500 filed with the IRS with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if any
such report was required) and all schedules and attachments thereto, (iii) the
most recent summary plan description for each material Company Benefit Plan
for which such summary plan description is required, (iv) each trust agreement
and group annuity contract, group insurance contract or single or set of
individual insurance contracts relating to any material Company Benefit Plan
and (v) the most recent favorable IRS determination letter for each Company
Benefit Plan that has had such a determination letter issued.

(b) Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each Company
Pension Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified Company Plans_ "). The IRS has
issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Qualified Company
Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked, and to the Knowledge of
the Company no circumstances exist and no events have occurred that could
adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Qualified Plan.

(c) No Company Pension Plan, other than any Company Multiemployer Pension
Plan had, as of the respective last annual valuation date for each such
Company Pension Plan, an "unfunded benefit liability" (within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions that have been
furnished to Parent. None of the Company Pension Plans (other than any Company
Multiemployer Pension Plan) has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such
term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether
or not waived, and for the plan year beginning after December 31, 2007, each
such Company Pension Plan meets the requirements for exemption from the
shortfall amortization base prescribed in Section 430(c)(5) of the Code and
in Section 303(c)(5) of ERISA. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
any officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of the Company
Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the Company Pension Plans
(other than any Company Multiemployer Pension Plan), any trusts created
thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that
could subject the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any officer of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to the Tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section
502(c), 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan or Company
Multiemployer Pension Plan has been terminated, nor has there been any
"reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan or Company Multiemployer Pension Plan
during the last five years. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are
defined in Sections 4203  



 

\- 18 -  and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) with respect to which any material
liability remains outstanding. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has ceased operations at any facility or has withdrawn from any Company
Benefit Plan that would subject one or any of them to liability under Sections
4062(e), 4063, 4064 or 4069 of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is subject to a lien under Section 4068 of ERISA.

with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
plan, (i) no such Company Benefit Plan is funded through a "welfare benefits
fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) and (ii) each
such Company Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), complies with the applicable
requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

(e) No Company Benefit Plan provides health, medical or other welfare benefits
after retirement or other termination of employment (other than for
continuation coverage required under Section 4980(B)(f) of the Code), and no
circumstances exist that could result in the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries becoming obligated to provide any such benefits.

(f) Each Company Benefit Plan, its related trust, insurance contract or other
funding vehicle has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the
Code and all other Laws applicable to the Company Benefit Plans. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with ERISA, the Code and all other Laws applicable to the Company
Benefit Plans.

(g) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
material claims by or on behalf of any participant in any of the Company
Benefit Plans, or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan or the
assets of any Company Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for benefits.

(h) No deduction by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries in respect of any
"applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
the Code) has been disallowed or would reasonably be expected to be disallowed
by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

(i) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with
the terms of this Agreement will not, (i) entitle any current or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to severance, change in control or termination compensation or
benefits (including any "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code)), (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan (except as
provided in Section 6.05 of this Agreement) or (iii) result in any breach or
violation of, or a default under, any Company Benefit Plan.



 

\- 19 - (j) Each of the Company Benefit Plans subject to Code Section 409A has been
administered in all material respects in good faith compliance with the
applicable requirements of Code Section 409A, IRS Notice 2005-1 and the
proposed regulations issued thereunder. Each Company Stock Option was granted
with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the per share fair
market value (as such term is used in Code Section 409A and the proposed
regulations and other Department of Treasury interpretative guidance issued
thereunder) of the Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option
on the grant date thereof.

(k) Except as individually or in the aggregate is not having or would not

required to be funded are fully funded based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions as of the most recent valuation, (iii) with respect to all other
Foreign Benefit Plans, adequate reserves therefor have been established on
the accounting statements of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to the
extent so required and (iv) no liability or obligation of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries exists with respect to such Foreign Benefit Plans that
has not been accrued in the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents to the extent so required.

by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from January 1, 2008 through the date
of the Agreement to any current or former director or officer of the Company
of any increase in compensation, bonus or fringe or other benefits or any type
of compensation or benefit to any such current or former director or officer
not previously entitled to receive such type of compensation or benefits,
other than for normal increases in compensation in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and (ii) of any increase in severance,
change in control or termination compensation benefits to any current or

Transactions on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, to refinance certain
existing indebtedness of the Parent and the Company and to pay related fees
and expenses, which Financing Letter includes terms and conditions for (i) a
$1.950 billion senior secured credit facility (the " _Senior Facility_ ") and
(ii) a $750.0 million unsecured "bridge" loan facility (the " _Bridge
Facility_ ") (or Senior Notes as defined in the Financing Letter (" _Senior
Notes_ ") in lieu thereof). The Lenders have committed to provide and arrange
the financing contemplated by the Financing Letter upon and subject to the
terms and conditions in the Financing Letter (the " _Financing_ "). Parent has
provided the Company with true, complete and correct copies of the Financing
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Financing Letter is in full
force and effect, is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Parent, and to the Knowledge of the Parent, the other parties thereto, and has
not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect without the prior written consent of the Company and no such amendment
or modification is contemplated by Parent or Sub or, to Parents Knowledge,
any other party thereto, and (ii) neither Parent nor Sub is in breach of any
of the terms or conditions set forth therein and no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth in
the Financing Letter. Parent and Sub have paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Letter that are payable on or
prior to the date of this Agreement.



 

\- 35 - (b) As of the date of this Agreement, subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, and
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02,
neither Parent nor Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy the conditions of closing to be satisfied by it set forth in the
Financing Letter on the Closing Date. Assuming the funding of the Financing in
accordance with the Financing Letter, the proceeds from such Financing
constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions, and, together with the Stock Consideration,
Parents cash on hand, and cash on hand from operations of the Company, are
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Subs obligations under
this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions and to pay all related fees and expenses (including
any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the
Financing Letter). There are no conditions precedent (i) to the availability
of the "flex" provisions set forth in the Financing Letter or (ii) other than
as expressly set forth in the Financing Letter, to the Lenders obligation to
fund that portion of the Financing required for the consummation of the Merger
and other Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (written or oral)
relating to the Financing (other than fee letters and an engagement letter
with respect to the Senior Notes with the providers of the Financing) to which
Parent or Sub or any of their Affiliates is a party. 

SECTION 4.14. _Capitalization of Sub_. As of the date of this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, no
par value, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent. Sub has no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement outstanding
pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any equity security
of Sub. Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement
and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions.

SECTION 4.15. _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote, consent, approval or other
action of the stockholders of Parent or the holders of any other securities
of Parent (equity or otherwise) is required by Law, the Parent Charter or
Parent Bylaws or the rules of the NYSE or otherwise to approve this Agreement
or the Merger or the other Transactions. The vote or consent of Parent as the
sole stockholder of Sub (which shall have occurred immediately following the
execution of this Agreement) is the only vote or consent of the stockholders
of Parent or Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the
other Transactions. 

SECTION 4.16. _Material Contracts_.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Material Contract" shall mean
each Contract that is a "material contract" pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K;

(b) The Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all Parent Material
Contracts as of the date of this Agreement, except for this
Agreement, Contracts filed or incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to the
Parents most recent annual report on Form 10-K and Contracts filed as an
Exhibit to any of Parents quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current  



 

\- 36 -  reports on Form 8-K filed since the filing of Parents most recent annual
report on Form 10-K. Each Parent Material Contract is a valid, binding
and legally enforceable obligation of Parent or one of the Parent
Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, is in full force and effect,
except for such failures to be valid, binding and legally enforceable or to be
in full force and effect that are not having or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. Subject to such exceptions as are not having or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, there is no default under any Parent Material
Contract by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Parent, by
any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that, with the lapse
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default
thereunder by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
by any other party thereto.

SECTION 4.17. _No Additional Representations_. Parent acknowledges that none
of the Company nor any Person has made any representation or warranty, express
or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Company furnished or made available to Parent and its Representatives
except as expressly set forth in Article IV (which includes the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Documents), and none of the Company or
any other Person shall be subject to any liability to Parent or any other
Person resulting from the Companys making available to Parent or Parents use
of such information or any information, documents or material made available
to Parent in the due diligence materials provided to Parent, including in the
"data room," in management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other
form in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty to the
Company with respect to any financial projection or forecast relating to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, whether or not included in any management
presentation.

SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation; Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to Sections 5.02(b) and 5.02(d), the Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize, give permission to or direct any Company Subsidiary or any
of their or its respective directors, officers or employees or any investment
banker, accountant, attorney or other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of, any Company Takeover
Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or knowingly take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates acting
at the direction or with the Knowledge of the Company shall be a breach of
this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Company Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal was not solicited after
the date of this Agreement in breach of this Section 5.02(a) and was made
after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 5.02(a), the Company may, subject to compliance with Section
5.02(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or other public or nonpublic information to the Person making
such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement with provisions not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such
confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provisions that would limit
the ability of such Person to make proposals to the Company Board, provided,
further, that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or
is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.



 

\- 43 - (b) Except as set forth in Section 8.01(g) and as otherwise set forth below,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the approval or recommendation by the
Company Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or
the other Transactions or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement
constituting or related to, any Company Takeover Proposal or that would
require the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or
other Transactions (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.02(a)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be or would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made until after the fifth Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice (a " _Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action
and specifying the terms and conditions of any Superior Company Proposal that
is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
term of such Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of
Adverse Recommendation and an additional five Business Day period). During
such five Business Day period (or five Business Day period in the case of an
amendment to the financial terms or any other material item of such Superior
Company Proposal), if requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
any Company Takeover Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior
Company Proposal no longer is a superior proposal. In determining whether to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take
into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to a Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (other
than the specific requirements of Section 8.01(g)), the Company shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement in connection with a Superior Company
Proposal pursuant to Section 8.01(g).

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully
informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof)
of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Parent as
soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of
all correspondence and other written material sent or provided directly or
indirectly to the Company or any Company Subsidiary from any Person that  



 

\- 44 -  describes any of the terms or conditions of any Company Takeover Proposal,
provided, however, that the Company need not provide Parent with any analysis

taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by or
complying with any other disclosure obligations under Section 14d-9 and
Section 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure
to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such disclosure constitutes a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, Parents rights under Section 8.01(e) may be exercised
to the extent provided in such section. Further, in the event that any
provision of this Section 5.02 conflicts with the Confidentiality Agreement,
this Section 5.02 shall govern.

(ii) " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any bona fide Company Takeover
Proposal (except that references in the definition of "Company Takeover
Proposal" to 20% shall be replaced by 50%) made by any Person other than a
party to this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor and in
consideration of such factors as the Company Board considers to be
appropriate) (A) is on terms that are more favorable to the Company and its
stockholders than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by

which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the
Company Common Stock and rights to acquire Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

(b) In addition to their obligations pursuant to Section 6.01(a), Parent and
the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and
the other Transactions under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder and provide each other with copies of any such filings.
Parent and the Company shall advise the other party, promptly after receipt of
notice thereof, of (and provide copies of any notices or communications with
respect to) the time of the effectiveness of the Form S-4, the filing of any
supplement or amendment thereto, the issuance of any stop order relating
thereto, the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable
in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of
any SEC request for amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form

for additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be filed without the approval of
each of Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4, which is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
 



 

\- 46 -  amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4
and, as required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to the Companys stockholders.

(d) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a

cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 and, as

(e) The Company shall take all action in accordance with the federal
securities laws, the DGCL, the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws
necessary to convene the Company Stockholder Meeting for the sole purpose of
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval (and any authority needed to adjourn
or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting as desirable) on the earliest
practicable date following the date the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed in definitive form to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, subject to the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement in connection with a Superior Company
Proposal pursuant to Section 8.01(g), the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholder Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to its
stockholders sufficiently in advance of the vote to be held at the Company
Stockholder Meeting or if there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to vote in favor of a
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement or to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting. The
Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that
they give the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by Section 5.02(b). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 6.01(e) shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) the making of any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board.

SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to the
restrictions imposed by any applicable Laws, including the HSR Act or other
U.S. antitrust Laws and Foreign Antitrust Laws, each of the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the
other party and to the Representatives of such other party reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to
all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule,  



 

\- 47 -  registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such other party may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that either
party may withhold (i) any document or information that is subject to the
terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party or subject to any
attorney-client privilege or (ii) such portions of documents or information
relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange
of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by such
partys counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for such
party or reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for such party (or any of
its Affiliates). If any material is withheld by such party pursuant to the
proviso to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other party as
to the general nature of the information that is being withheld. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, within two
Business Days of request therefor, provide to Parent the information described
in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information to which a
holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled under Section 220 of the
DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such section), and Parent
shall, within two Business Days of request therefor, provide to the Company
any information to which a holder of Parent Common Stock would be entitled
under Section 220 of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of
such section).

All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to
the confidentiality agreement dated May 26, 2008 between the Company and
Parent (including any amendment, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

SECTION 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and
the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
6.04(c) and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be prohibited under this Section 6.03(a) from
taking any action permitted by Section 5.02(b).



 

\- 48 - (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Sub shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (in each case, to its Knowledge) (i)
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not
so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the
failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require any party to (i) consent to any
action or omission by any other party that would be inconsistent with Section
5.01, absent such consent or (ii) agree to amend or waive any provision of
this Agreement.

SECTION 6.04. _Governmental Approvals_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company agree (i) to make an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act within ten Business
Days after the date of this Agreement and any other filing or application
required under Foreign Antitrust Laws, including the EC Merger Regulation, as
promptly as practicable, with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions and (ii) to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act or such Foreign Antitrust Laws, as applicable, and to take all
other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain
consents, approvals or authorizations under Foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as
practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period
provided for in the HSR Act.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) keep each other apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws, and shall comply with any such inquiry or
request as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and
consult with each other in connection with the making of all filings,
notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 6.04,
including, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed
written communication to any Governmental Entity and provide counsel for the
other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by such party and
all correspondence and other written communications between such party (and
its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied
by such party and such partys Subsidiaries to a Governmental Entity or
received from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted
before being provided to the other party (x) to remove references concerning
the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality  



 

\- 49 -  concerns and (ii) furnish to the other parties such information and
assistance as such parties reasonably may request in connection with the
preparation of any submissions to, or agency proceedings by, any Governmental
Entity. Upon and subject to the terms of this Section 6.04, each party agrees
to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist in any defense by
any other party to this Agreement of the Merger and the Transactions before
any Governmental Entity reviewing the Merger and the Transactions, including
by providing as promptly as practicable such information as may be requested
by such Governmental Entity or such assistance as may be reasonably requested
by the other party to this Agreement in such defense.

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Merger or the Transactions under the HSR Act, other U.S. antitrust Laws or
any Foreign Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions, or
if any Action is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging any of the Transactions as violative of the HSR Act, other U.S.
antitrust Laws or any Foreign Antitrust Law, or an order is issued
enjoining the Merger or the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits
so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by the Closing, including in order to resolve such
objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger and the Transactions. In the event that any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by
any Person, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable. Parent and the
Company shall not extend, directly or indirectly, any such waiting period or
enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions on the Closing Date, except
with the prior written consent of the other party to this Agreement. Parent
and the Company shall not have any substantive contact with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by this Section
6.04 unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to participate.

 

(e) Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, shall use reasonable best efforts to take any action
necessary to avoid and eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act,
other U.S. antitrust Laws or any Foreign Antitrust Laws, so as to enable the
consummation of the Merger and the Transactions as soon as reasonably
possible, including, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold  



 

\- 50 -  separate order, mitigation agreement or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of their respective businesses, product lines or assets and (ii)
otherwise using reasonable best efforts to take or commit to take actions that
after consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions would limit
Parents or the Parent Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries or the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order,
or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and
the other Transactions. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and, if requested
by Parent, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, shall agree to divest,
sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any
actions that limit its freedom of action with respect to, or Parents or any
Parent Subsidiarys ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation), provided that any such action
is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be obligated to take or
proffer to take any of the foregoing actions if such actions (i) would be
reasonably likely in the aggregate to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Surviving Corporation), taken as a
whole or (ii) would be prohibited by Section 8 of the Financing Letter.

SECTION 6.05. _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become fully exercisable and vested. Subject to the
proration provisions set forth in Section 6.05(d), each holder of a Company
Stock Option shall be given the opportunity, prior to the Election Deadline,
to elect either (i) to cause such Company Stock Option (a " _Stock Electing
Option_ ") to become and represent an option to acquire shares of Parent
Common Stock (a " _Converted Stock Option_ ") in accordance with paragraph (b)
of this Section 6.05 or (ii) to cause such Company Stock Option (a "
_Cash Electing Option_ ") to be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum
cash payment (less any required Tax withholding) (the " _Company Option Cash
Out Amount_ "), in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Cash Out Amount over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock
Option, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 6.05. Subject to the
proration provisions set forth in Section 6.05(d), to the extent any holder of
a Company Stock Option shall not have made an election with respect to such
Company Stock Option prior to the Election Deadline, such Company Stock
Option shall be deemed to be a Stock Electing Option. Section 6.05(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter lists certain individuals that have agreed that
their Company Stock Options will be treated as Cash Electing Options (subject
to limited exceptions) in accordance with the terms of letter agreements
between such individuals and the Company, and true and correct copies of such
letter agreements have been provided to Parent.

(b) Each Stock Electing Option shall, immediately following the Effective
Time, and without any further action on the part of the holder thereof,
be assumed by Parent and converted into a fully vested Converted Stock
Option, on the same terms and conditions (except as provided in this Section
6.05(b)) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, to  



 

\- 51 -  purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option multiplied by (y) the Special Exchange Ratio (as defined
in Section 6.05(h)) (provided that any fractional share resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share). The exercise
price per share of each Converted Stock Option resulting from the conversion
of the Company Stock Option pursuant to this Section 6.05(b) shall be equal to
the quotient of (i) the exercise price per share of the Company Stock Option
that converted into the Converted Stock Option divided by (ii) the Special
Exchange Ratio (provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole cent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in the case of any option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under either Section 422 or 424 of the
Code ("qualified stock options"), the option price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of
the Code.

(c) Each Cash Electing Option shall, immediately following the Effective Time,
and without any further action on the part 
of any holder thereof, be cancelled in exchange for the Company Option Cash
Out Amount. The Surviving Corporation or Parent 
shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the payments described in this
Section 6.05(c) on or as soon as reasonably 
practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event (i) within seven Business
Days following the Closing Date if the _pro ration_ set forth in Section
6.05(d) does not apply and (ii) within ten Business Days of the Closing Date
if the _pro ration_ set forth in 
Section 6.05(d) does apply.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that the number of Stock Electing Options, when considered together
with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant
to the provisions of this Agreement, including upon the exercise of Warrants
and the conversion of Convertible Debentures outstanding at the Effective
Time, would cause Parent to exceed the limitation set forth in Section
6.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Applicable Limitation_ "),
then the In the Money Stock Electing Options shall be subject to _pro rata_
reduction solely to the extent necessary to cause Parent not to exceed the
Applicable Limitation and such _pro rata_ reduction shall apply on the
following basis: With respect to each holder of In the Money Stock Electing
Options, a number of In the Money Stock Electing Options equal to (i) all of
such holders In the Money Stock Electing Options minus (ii) the Rollover
Amount, shall be deemed to be Cash Electing Options and the balance of such
holders In the Money Stock Electing Options shall continue to be Stock
Electing Options. For purposes of this Section 6.05(d), with respect to any
holder of In the Money Stock Electing Options, " _Rollover Amount_ " means a
number of In the Money Stock Electing Options (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (x) all of such holders In the Money
Stock Electing Options multiplied by (y) the quotient of (I) the Maximum
Amount divided by (II) the number of all In the Money Stock Electing Options;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each holder of In the Money
Stock Electing Options subject to _pro rata_ reduction under this Section
6.05(d), the designation of Cash Electing Options shall apply to the
applicable portion of such holders In the Money Stock Electing Options with
the greatest positive intrinsic value ( _i.e._ , the excess of the Cash Out
Amount over the exercise price) immediately prior to the Effective Time and
thereafter to such holders In the Money Stock Electing Options with the next
greatest positive intrinsic value as of  



 

\- 52 -  immediately prior to the Effective Time (and so on), in each case, to the
extent necessary. For purposes of this Section 6.06(d), "In the Money Stock
Electing Options" means any Stock Electing Options with an exercise price
lower than the Cash Out Amount as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For purposes of this Section 6.06(d), the " _Maximum Amount_ " means the
difference between (A) such number of Stock Electing Options that, in the
reasonable, good faith judgment of Parent, would not result in Parent
exceeding the Applicable Limitation minus (B) the number of Stock Electing
Options that are not In the Money Stock Electing Options.

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share
shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c) of this Agreement.

(f) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company RSUs_ ") shall be converted into
a vested right to receive cash with a value equal to the product of (i) the
Cash Out Amount and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company RSUs (less any required Tax withholding) (such amount,
the " _Company RSU Consideration_ "). Subject to the immediately following
sentence, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall pay the holders of Company
RSUs the Company RSU Consideration on or as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date, but in any event within five Business Days following
the Closing Date. In the event that any Company RSUs are subject to Section
409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall pay the Company
RSU Consideration in respect of such Company RSUs (x) if the Closing Date
occurs on or prior to December 31, 2008, on January 2, 2009 (or earlier if
permitted under Section 409A of the Code) and (y) if the Closing Date occurs
on or after January 1, 2009, as soon as permissible under Section 409A of the
Code, and in either such case, such delayed payments shall include earnings
thereon from and after the Effective Time until the applicable payment date,
at a rate equal to 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate as
prescribed under Section 1274(d) of the Code.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
provisions of this Section 6.05. In addition, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to effect the following:

(i) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as it deems appropriate
to give effect to the Merger (subject to the approval of Parent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and

(ii) ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Company Stock Options or other
awards may be granted under any Company Stock Plan.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Special Exchange Ratio_ "
shall mean the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio plus (ii) the quotient of (x) the
Cash Consideration divided by (y) the Parent Closing Price.



 

\- 53 - (i) At the Effective Time, and subject to compliance by the Company with
Section 6.05(a), other than with respect to Cash Electing Options which shall
be entitled to the consideration contemplated by Section 6.05(c), Parent shall
assume all the obligations of the Company with respect to each outstanding
Company Stock Option under the applicable Company Stock Plan and the
applicable agreement evidencing the grant thereof. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock
Options (other than Cash Electing Options) appropriate notices setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans, and the
agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options (other than
Cash Electing Options) shall continue in effect on the same terms
and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 6.05
after giving effect to the Merger).

(j) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Converted Stock Options resulting from the conversion of Stock
Electing Options assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 6.05. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Converted Stock Options resulting from the conversion of Stock Electing
Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained

compensation and benefits to the employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") that, taken as a whole (and not on
individual employee basis), are substantially comparable to the compensation
and benefits received by such Company Employees in the aggregate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that until
January 1, 2011, Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to each Company Employee (on an individual basis) base salary or base
wages that are at least equal to the base salary or base wages payable to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their respective terms (as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time), all the Company Benefit
Plans and the Foreign Benefit Plans, subject to the rights of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any such agreements, plans
or policies in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time) or as permitted by applicable Law.
 



 

\- 55 -  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
Company Employees whose employment terminates prior to January 1, 2011, with
severance benefits at the levels and pursuant to the terms of the Companys
severance plans and policies as in effect immediately prior to the Effective

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary (including any severance plan) (the " _New Plans_ "), in
which Company Employees participate after the Effective Time, for all
purposes (other than benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan),
service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (and their respective
predecessors) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with
Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes
of a New Plan that is Parents retiree medical, dental and group life plans,
the prior service credit shall only be counted towards meeting the five years
of service eligibility component for such plans and that the Company
Employees shall be otherwise treated as newly hired employees with regard to
the retiree medical plan coverage resulting in access-only coverage thereunder
to the extent the Company Employees otherwise meet the requirements for
coverage thereunder; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. To the
extent permitted by the New Plans, each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit
Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of the Merger.

(d) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations or actively-at-work requirements under any welfare benefit plan
(including with respect to any plan providing for medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits) maintained by Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company) in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such preexisting condition
limitation or actively-at-work requirement would have been applicable under
the comparable Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible, maximum out-of-pocket
requirements and co-payment limitations under the New Plans in which they
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent agrees to continue or cause the Surviving Corporation to continue,
through December 31, 2011, the Companys retiree welfare programs, including
medical prescription drugs and retiree life insurance program (the " _Company
Retiree Welfare Programs_ ") on terms and conditions no less favorable in
duration, scope, value, participant cost, vesting and otherwise than those in
 



 

\- 56 -  effect as of the Effective Time ( _provided_ , _however_ , that participant
costs shall increase on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent the current
maximum employer costs of $275 per person per month for individuals under age
65 and $59 per person per month for individuals age 65 and over are exceeded)
with respect to (i) all individuals who as of the time immediately prior to
the Effective Time are receiving benefits under the Company Retiree Welfare
Programs and (ii) all Company Employees who retire at any time on or prior to
December 31, 2013 and are eligible to receive benefits under the Company
Retiree Welfare Programs as of the date of such retirement (clauses (i) and
(ii) together, the " _Applicable Company Group_ "). Following December 31,
2011, Parent agrees to provide to the Applicable Company Group welfare
programs, including medical prescription drugs and retiree life insurance
program, on terms and conditions no less favorable in duration, scope, value,
participant cost, vesting and otherwise than the lesser of (x) those in effect
with respect to the group of Parent retirees eligible to receive subsidized
retiree welfare benefits under Parents retiree welfare programs as they
existed prior to July 1, 2003 and (y) those in effect under the Company
Retiree Welfare Program in effect as of the Effective Time ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to this clause (y), participant costs shall
increase on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent the current maximum
employer costs of $275 per person per month for individuals under age 65 and
$59 per person per month for individuals age 65 and over are exceeded).

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
through December 31, 2010, each Company Employee shall continue to accrue
benefits under the Pension Plan of Hercules Incorporated, Plan No. 001, and,
to the extent applicable, the Companys excess benefit plan, within the
meaning of Section 3(36) of ERISA (the " _Excess Plan_ "), each as in effect
on the date of this Agreement. Each Company Employee who is a participant in
the Pension Plan of Hercules Incorporated immediately before the Effective
Time shall have a guaranteed minimum benefit calculated thereunder as of the
Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, with respect to each Company
Employee who is a participant in the Pension Plan of Hercules Incorporated as
of the Effective Time, service with the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time will be credited under the Pension Plan of
Hercules Incorporated and the Excess Plan (to the extent applicable)
for eligibility to receive benefits under such plans.

(g) In accordance with, and not in limitation of, the provisions of Section
9.07, the parties acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 6.06 are
solely for the benefit of the parties, and no current or former employee,
director or consultant or any other individual associated therewith (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and no provision of this Section
6.06 shall create such rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits
that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan
or Foreign Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or compensation program, plan
or arrangement of Parent or any of its Affiliates. No provision of this
Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or
terminate after the Effective Time and in accordance with their terms any such
plans or arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan for any
purpose. No provision of this Section 6.06 shall require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to continue the employment
of any employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any
specific period of time following the Effective Date.



 

\- 57 - SECTION 6.07. _Convertible Debentures_. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent to take such
actions as are required under Sections 801 and 1311 of the Convertible
Debentures Indenture to give effect to the Merger, including entering into a
supplemental indenture.

SECTION 6.08. _Indemnification and Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current
and former directors or officers of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and the Persons who served as a director, officer, trustee,
employee or agent of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans maintained or sponsored by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms; _provided_ _that_ any Indemnified Party to whom expenses may be
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable
order that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) For six years from and after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the Companys (as the Surviving Company) and each of
the Company Subsidiaries (or their respective successors) certificates of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the Company Certificate and
the Company Bylaws), and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or
resolution of such claim.

(c) Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor,
guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of
the agreements contained in this Section 6.08 from and after the Effective
Time.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company
to purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy for
the Company and its current directors and officers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall provide the Company and
such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons (including the Company) than the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company; _provided_ _that_ Parent shall not be required to pay an
aggregate premium for such policy in excess of 250% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company for its directors and officers liability
insurance coverage (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), and in the event that the
Maximum Premium is insufficient for such  



 

\- 58 -  coverage, Parent shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that is
available for such amount. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder.

(e) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
are incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing Parents obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.08.

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, any other indemnification
arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.08 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit,
and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(g) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (x) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (y) transfer all or substantially all of their
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.08.

SECTION 6.09. _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $77,500,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") if: (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e);
(ii) (A) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any Person makes a Company
Takeover Proposal that is not withdrawn, (B) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), 8.01(b)(iii) or 8.01(c) (but only if a vote
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval is not held or the Company
Stockholder Meeting has not been held) and (C) within 18 months of such
termination the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or
consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Company Takeover Proposal
(for purposes of this Section 6.09(b)(ii)(C), the term "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section
5.02(e), except that all references to "20%" shall be changed to "50%"); or
(iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g) (each
of the events described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, a " _Company
Payment Event_ "). Any Termination Fee due under this Section 6.09(b) shall be
paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the fifth Business Day following
(x) the date of termination of this Agreement, in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii) above or (y) the date of the first to occur of the events referred to in
the case of clause (ii) above. Further, if both clauses (ii)(A) and (ii)(B)
occur, regardless of whether clause (ii)(C) occurs, then the Company shall
pay to Parent all documented fees and expenses of Parent, including fees and
expenses of financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts
and consultants, incurred by Parent in connection with the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement, the Transactions and the Financing (" _Parent Expenses_ "), up to a
 



 

\- 59 -  maximum of $12,500,000, by wire transfer of same-day funds on the fifth
Business Day following the receipt of an invoice therefore. If, subsequent to
such payment of Parent Expenses, the Company enters into a definitive
Contract to consummate a Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to clause (ii)(C)
above, then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the excess of the Termination Fee minus the Parent Expenses paid
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence on the fifth Business Day
following the date of the first to occur of such event(s) referred to above in
this sentence. In the event of a Company Payment Event, the Companys payment
of the Termination Fee will be considered liquidated damages for any breach by
the Company of this Agreement and in the event of such payment, the Company
shall have no other liability for any breach by it of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, other than in the case of Sections 6.09(a), 6.09(e) and 8.02. If
the Termination Fee is paid, in no event will Parent seek to recover any other
money damages or seek any other remedy (including specific performance under
Section 9.10(a)) from the Company (or its Affiliates) with respect to the
Transactions, regardless of whether such monetary damages or other remedies
are based on a claim in law or equity, and all such claims are hereby waived.

(c) In the event all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 7.01
and 7.02 are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but which conditions at the time
of termination shall be capable of being satisfied) and (i) Parent or Sub
cannot satisfy its obligation to effect the Closing at such time as
contemplated by Section 1.02 or such later time as agreed to by the Company
because of a failure to receive the proceeds from the Financing or any
Alternate Financing (a " _Financing Failure_ ") and (ii) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(h) or 8.01(i), then Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Company $77,500,000 (the " _Parent Financing Failure
Fee_ ") in immediately available funds within five Business Days following
such termination. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained between December 19, 2008 and
January 19, 2009, then Parent cannot avoid payment of the Parent Financing
Failure Fee by claiming that any Event occurring during the period between (x)
six Business Days after the date the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained
and (y) January 26, 2009 is having or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(d) In the event of a Financing Failure, Parents payment of the Parent
Financing Failure Fee will be considered liquidated damages for any breach by
Parent of this Agreement and in the event of such payment, Parent shall have
no other liability for any breach by it of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, other than in
the case of Sections 6.09(a), 6.09(e) and 8.02. If the Parent Financing
Failure Fee is paid, in no event will the Company seek to recover any other
money damages or seek any other remedy (including specific performance under
Section 9.10(a)) from Parent, Sub (or their respective Affiliates) or Lenders
with respect to the Transactions, regardless of whether such monetary damages
or other remedies are based on a claim in law or equity, and all such claims
are hereby waived.

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this Section 6.09 are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if  



 

\- 60 -  the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section
6.09(b), or Parent fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section
6.09(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Person owed the fee
commences a suit that results in a judgment in its favor for the fee, the
Person owing the fee shall pay to the Person owed the fee its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate
reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ as in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

SECTION 6.10. _Public Announcements_. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the
other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be a
joint press release in the form agreed to by the parties.

SECTION 6.11. _Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to and in accordance
with this Agreement to be approved for listing on NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 6.12. _Certain Tax Matters; Section 16_.

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective
Time. Each of Parent and the Company shall pay, without deduction from any
amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock and without reimbursement
from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on it by any Governmental
Entity, which becomes payable in connection with the Merger.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall take all
such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Law)
to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock or acquisitions of Parent
Common Stock (including, in each case, derivative securities) resulting from
the Merger and the other Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 6.13. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions. The Company shall not settle any such action without the prior
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,  



 

\- 61 -  delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement does not provide for monetary
damages, the terms of such settlement are not in any way detrimental to
Parent or the Surviving Company and such settlement does not contain any
admission detrimental to Parent or the Surviving Company.

SECTION 6.14.  _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the
Financing Letter (without regard to any adverse impact on any of Parents
corporate default or equivalent credit ratings (whether by Moodys, Standard and
Poors or other recognized credit rating agencies)), and on such other terms
as Parent and the Lenders shall agree, (ii) to satisfy (or obtain the waiver
of) all conditions on a timely basis to obtaining the Financing applicable to
each of Parent and Sub set forth in such definitive agreements that are within
its control, (iii) to comply in all material respects with its obligations
under the Financing Letter (or obtain the waiver thereof) and (iv) to enforce
its rights under the Financing Letter. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice upon becoming aware of any material breach of the Financing Letter by
a party to the Financing Letter or any termination of the Financing Letter.
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to
the Company, upon its request, copies of the definitive documents related to
the Financing (other than fee letters) and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy
under, the Financing Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of Financing, (ii) adversely amends or expands
the conditions to the drawdown of the Financing in any respect that could make
the conditions less likely to be satisfied by the End Date, (iii) can
reasonably be expected to delay the Closing or the date on which the Financing
would be obtained or (iv) is otherwise adverse to the interests of the Company
in any other respect except with the prior written consent of the Company
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the
event that all conditions in the Financing Letter have been satisfied or, upon
funding, will be satisfied, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Lenders to fund on the Closing Date the Financing
required to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions (provided Parent
is not required to bring any claims against Lenders to cause the Lenders to
fund such Financing). In the event that Parent becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing unlikely
to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing
Letter, Parent shall immediately notify the Company and Parent and Sub shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange any such portion
(other than amounts that are replaced by Parents cash on hand) from
alternative sources (such portion from alternate sources, the " _Alternate
Financing_ ") on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, no less favorable to
Parent and Sub. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (x) the proceeds
from the Senior Notes are not available, (y) all closing conditions contained
in Article VII (other than the delivery of a certificate pursuant to Sections
7.02(a) and 7.03(a)) shall have been satisfied or waived and (z) the Bridge
Facility and Senior Facility contemplated by the Financing Letter (or
Alternate Financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) and the
proceeds thereof are available on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Letter (or replacement thereof), then Parent and Sub shall cause
the proceeds of the Bridge Facility to be used in lieu of proceeds from the
Senior Notes on the Closing.



 

\- 62 - (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their officers and employees to provide, on a timely basis, all
reasonable cooperation requested by Parent and that is customary in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing or any Alternate Financing to be
incurred in connection with the Transactions (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries), including using its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) facilitate the provision of guarantees and pledge of
collateral (effective as of the Closing), (ii) provide financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent in order to consummate the
Financing or as necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in the Financing
Letter (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), (iii) provide copies of
the most recent appraisals, environmental reports, evidence of title
(including copies of deeds, lease documentation, title insurance policies
and/or commitments for title insurance, title opinions, surveys, and similar
information), and similar information with respect to the properties and
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, (iv) provide other reasonably requested customary
certificates or documents, including a customary certificate of the principal
financial officer of the Surviving Corporation (in his capacity as such) with
respect to solvency matters, (v) request such customary legal opinions (which
may be reasoned if circumstances require) and customary comfort letters
as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (vi) participate in a reasonable
number of informational meetings and road show meetings in connection with the
Financing and (vii) assist Parent and its financing sources in the preparation
of all agreements (including review of schedules for completeness), offering
documents, an offering memorandum and other marketing and rating agency
materials for the Financing or any such Alternate Financing, it being
understood and agreed that information and documents provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries may be delivered to agents and lenders under the
Financing Letter and their representatives (subject to customary arrangements
for confidentiality that are substantially similar to the provisions in the
Confidentiality Agreement or reasonably acceptable to the Company); _provided_
that no certificate, document or instrument referred to above shall be
effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the
Financing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall promptly, upon request by
the Company, reimburse Company for all out-of-pocket costs (including
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with the cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 6.14 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees and representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any information provided by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall afford Parent and its authorized representatives (who shall include
agents and lenders under the Financing Letter and their representatives)
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
to the real property of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct
such investigations and activities as are necessary to consummate the
Transactions; _provided_ that any such investigations and activities shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.



 

\- 63 - (c) For purposes of this Section 6.14, the term " _Financing_ " shall also be
deemed to include any Alternative Financing and the term " _Financing Letter_
" shall also be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement)

under this  



 

\- 66 -  Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to

ruling, injunction, order or decree as required by Section 6.03; or

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company
Stockholder Meeting duly convened (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof).

(c) By Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) and (ii)
cannot be or has not been cured within 30 calendar days after the giving of
written notice to the Company of such breach or failure.

respect any of its representations or warranties (other than
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.13 or Section
4.08(b)) or covenants (other than the covenants contained in Section 6.14)
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give

Approval, (i) the Company Board has received a Superior Company Proposal, (ii)
in light of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to withdraw or modify its recommendation of  



 

\- 67 -  this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards exercise of its fiduciary duty under applicable
Law, (iii) the Company is in compliance in all material respects with Section
5.02 and (iv) the Companys Board concurrently approves, and the Company
concurrently enters into, a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of such Superior Company Proposal.

(h) By the Company if the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 7.01 and

such Closing) if Parent does not (i) satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 7.03(c) within five Business Days (or by January 26, 2009 if the
Company Stockholders Meeting at which the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained occurs between December 19, 2008 and January 19, 2009) after notice

7.03(a) and (b) are satisfied (or, upon an immediate Closing, would be
satisfied as of such Closing) and (ii) proceed immediately thereafter to give

(i) By the Company, if Parent breaches or fails to perform in any material
respect any of its representations or warranties contained in Section 4.13 or
any of its covenants contained in Section 6.14, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within 30
calendar days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach or
failure.

Parent advises the Company that it cannot deliver the certificate required by
Section 7.03(d) because the representation and warranty in Section 4.08(b) is
not true and correct.

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than
the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.09, this Section 8.02 and Article
IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, except, liability arising
out of any willful or intentional breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants in this Agreement (subject to any express limitations
set forth in this Agreement), any action for fraud, or as provided for in the
Confidentiality Agreement (which shall survive termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms), in which case the aggrieved party shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

SECTION 8.03. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;  _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no
amendment shall be made that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such further approval, (ii) no amendment
shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time and (iii) except as
provided in clause (i) above, no amendment of this Agreement shall require the
approval of the stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not

parties.

the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the

\- 68 -  other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by the Company
shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company unless such
approval is required by Law and no extension or waiver by Parent shall
require the approval of the stockholders of Parent unless such approval is
required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders of the
Company or Parent.

itself and its property to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts

by motion, as a defense, counterclaim or other request for leave from any
such court or otherwise, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating

fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, agrees not to assert any
claim that (i) the action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
