value of any unresolved item affects any other item used in calculating the
amounts set forth in the Final Closing Statement, such effect may be taken

Adjustment to such account(s) as specified by Seller by wire transfer of

2.05(c)** shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to
the Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) _Fees of the Independent Accountants_. Purchaser shall pay a portion of
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant equal to one hundred
percent (100%) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount
of disputed amounts submitted to the Independent Accountant that are resolved
in favor of Seller (that being the absolute value of the difference between
the Independent Accountants determination and Purchasers determination) and
the denominator of which is the total amount of disputed amounts submitted to
the Independent Accountants (that being the sum total by which Sellers
determination and Purchasers determination differ from the determination of
the Independent Accountants). Seller shall pay that portion of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants that the Purchaser is not required to

relating to the business or financial or

 



       
 

 



 

operating condition of the Company in their possession with respect to periods
prior to the Closing Date and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom,
in each case solely to the extent that such access may reasonably be required
by the requesting Party in connection with (i) compliance with the
requirements of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or (ii) in connection
with any actual or threatened Action or Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company) shall not be required
to make available their income Tax Returns. Further, Seller and Purchaser
shall not, and Purchaser shall cause the Company to not, for a period
extending seven (7) years after the Closing Date, or such longer period as
such books, records and other data remain relevant to open Tax years or to any
pending investigation by a Governmental or Regulatory Authority or any pending
litigation if such investigation or litigation relates in any material respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing, destroy or otherwise dispose of any
such books, records and other data unless such Party shall first offer by
notice to the other to surrender such books, records and other data to the
notifying Party, to be held subject to appropriate confidentiality
restrictions as applicable, and such other Party shall not agree in writing to
take possession thereof during the ten (10) day period after such offer is

 **Section 2.07** **Withholding**. If any amount is required by Law to be
deducted or withheld on account of any Tax with respect to payments made under
this Agreement to Seller, such Tax shall be deducted by Purchaser or the
Escrow Agent, as applicable, from the amounts required to be paid under this
Agreement and such Person shall promptly remit such deduction or withholding
on account of any Tax (if any) to the relevant Governmental or Regulatory
Authority and shall promptly provide the Seller with the appropriate receipts
for such payments. All Tax amounts deducted or withheld from payments pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall be treated as having been actually paid to the
Seller for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 2.08** **Pre-Closing Restructuring**. Immediately prior to the
Closing and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller
will cause the transactions set forth on **Section 2.08 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule** to occur (such transactions, collectively, the " **Pre-
Closing Restructuring** ").

 



 

 **Section 2.09** **Purchase Price Allocation**. Purchaser and Seller agree
that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the purchase of the Interests will
be treated as an acquisition of the assets of the Company. In consideration
for the Purchase Price and the applicable liabilities of the Company, within
sixty (60) days after the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
**Section 2.05**, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller an allocation
statement (the " **Allocation** ") allocating the Purchase Price (and any
assumed liabilities to the extent properly taken into account under the Code)
among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision
of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate). Seller shall provide the
Allocation to NRG for review and comment and shall send Purchaser a written
notice of any objections to the Allocation within a commercially reasonable
period of time following the Closing Date. Seller, NRG and Purchaser shall
work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation. If
Seller, NRG and Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute within twenty
(20) days after Purchasers receipt of objections by Seller and/or NRG, any
remaining disputes shall be submitted to a nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as mutually agreed to by Seller, NRG and Purchaser. The
Allocation, as finally determined hereunder, shall be adjusted to reflect any
adjustment to the Purchase Price provided under this Agreement as mutually
agreed by Purchaser and Seller (and

 



      
 

 



 

agreed to by NRG). Purchaser and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including,
but not limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the
Allocation, as finally determined hereunder (as adjusted in accordance with
this **Section 2.09**). Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall take any Tax
position inconsistent with such Allocation (as adjusted in accordance with
this **Section 2.09**) except as required, after using good faith efforts to
support the Allocation in any applicable challenge by a Governmental or
Regulatory Authority, to settle a dispute with a Governmental or Regulatory
Authority with respect to the Allocation.

 



 

 **Section 2.10** **Post-Closing Excess Fuel Inventory Payments**.

 



 

(a) _Fuel Inventory Payments_. After the Closing, Purchaser and the Company
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Seller or its designee for all Excess
Fuel Inventory as follows (such payments set forth in _Section 2.10(a)(i)_
and _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_, the " **Fuel Inventory Payments** "):

 



 

(i) _Monthly Consumption Payment_. With respect to each calendar month that
ends during the Fuel Inventory Payment Period, a cash payment in an amount
equal to the actual amount of No. 6 Oil consumed at the Project during such
calendar month (the " **Monthly Consumption** "), _multiplied by_ the Market
Price; and

 



 

(ii) _True Up Payment_. At the end of the Fuel Inventory Payment Period, if
the aggregate Monthly Consumption during the Fuel Inventory Payment Period is
less than the Excess Fuel Inventory (a " **Fuel Inventory Payment Shortfall**
"), a cash payment equal to the positive difference between (A) the Excess
Fuel Inventory and (B) the aggregate Monthly Consumption during the Fuel
Inventory Payment Period, _multiplied by_ the Market Price.

 



 

(b) _Payment Timing_. Each Fuel Inventory Payment is a separate stand-alone
payment obligation and Sellers entitlement to any Fuel Inventory Payment is
not contingent upon any other Fuel Inventory Payment having accrued. Each Fuel
Inventory Payment owing to Seller hereunder shall be due and payable to Seller
within ten (10) Business Days after (i) with respect to _Section 2.10(a)(i)_,
the end of the applicable calendar month, and (ii) with respect to _Section
2.10(a)(ii)_, after the end of the Fuel Inventory Payment Period. Concurrently
with such payment, Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide reasonably
detailed documentation regarding the then-current amount of Excess Fuel
Inventory and the Monthly Consumption during the applicable Fuel Inventory
Payment Period.

 



 

(c) _Failure to Pay_. If Purchaser fails to pay any Fuel Inventory Payment
owing pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ within the time period specified, as
applicable, then Purchaser shall pay the costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Seller in connection with any
Action or Proceeding taken to collect payment of such amount, together with
interest on such unpaid amount at the Applicable Rate, calculated on a daily
basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of
actual payment.

 



 

(d) _Assignment of Fuel Inventory Payments_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, upon notice to Purchaser, Seller shall have the
right at any time to sell, assign or transfer all or a portion of its right to
receive the Fuel Inventory Payments under this _Section 2.10_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Tax Treatment of Fuel Inventory Payments_. Seller and Purchaser agree
that, for applicable tax purposes, the right to receive the Fuel Inventory
Payments will not constitute a purchase price adjustment but, instead, shall
constitute separate consideration paid by Purchaser to Seller at Closing.
Seller and Purchaser shall value the right to receive the Fuel Inventory
Payments at Closing in a manner consistent with applicable federal income tax
law and shall include such amount in the amount realized by Seller at Closing.
The valuation determined pursuant to the preceding sentence shall control for
all applicable tax purposes (including, but not limited to, **Section 2.09**)
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary. If Purchaser and
Seller are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to this **Section
2.10(e)** then all such unresolved disputes shall be submitted to a nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm as mutually agreed to by Seller
and Purchaser.

qualified under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state
securities or blue sky Laws, (b) there is no public market for the Interests
and it is not anticipated that there shall be and (c) the Interests must be
held, and Purchaser must continue to bear the economic risk of the investment

subsequently registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state or
non-U.S. securities Laws or an exemption from registration is available. The
Interests are being acquired by Purchaser for its own account for the purpose

 **Section 5.08** **Financing**.

 



 

(a) Purchaser has received and accepted an executed commitment letter dated as
of the date of this Agreement (together with each exhibit, annex, schedule or
other attachment thereto, as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or
extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with
**Section 7.06(b),** the " **Debt Commitment Letter** ") from the lenders
party thereto (including any lenders who become party thereto by joinder in
accordance with the terms thereof) (collectively, the " **Lenders** ")
pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to provide the debt amounts set forth therein, which is the full
amount of the debt financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such debt financing and any permitted
Alternative Debt Financing, the " **Debt Financing** "). Purchaser has
delivered to Seller true, complete and correct copies of the executed Debt
Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and a customary redacted (i.e.
redacted as to pricing terms, market flex and other economic terms) version of
the fee letter referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter (and none of such
redacted portions would adversely affect the amount, conditionality or
availability of the Debt Financing) (each as amended, modified, supplemented,
replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with **Section 7.06(b)**, the " **Fee Letter** "). The Commitment
Letters have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement
and no such amendment or modification that could reasonably be expected to
impact the conditionality or aggregate amount of the Financing is
contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) the respective commitments
contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, modified,
amended, terminated or rescinded in any respect and(b) no such withdrawal,
termination, rescission, amendment or modification is contemplated (other than
amendments and modifications permitted under **Section 7.06(b)**). Except as
set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the
obligations of the Lenders or Equity Financing providers to provide the
Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders or Equity
Financing providers to reduce the

 



      
 

 



 

total amount of the Financing. There are no agreements, side letters or other
arrangements relating to the Financing to which Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates is a party that could impose conditions to the funding of the
Financing, other than those set forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect
and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser and, to
the Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting rights of creditors and that equitable remedies, including specific
performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered. Assuming the Financing
is funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller and the Company set forth in this
Agreement and performance by each of them of their respective obligations
hereunder, as of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser is able to, and does
not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to, satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition to the initial funding of the Financing on the
Closing Date contained in the Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by
it. Subject to its terms and conditions, the Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter, will provide
Purchaser with cash on the Closing Date, together with available cash,
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including making all necessary payments of fees and expenses in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby). As of the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters or the Fee Letter
on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts
due on or before the Closing Date when such amounts are due.

 



 

(b) The Limited Guarantee is valid and in full force and effect and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

for purposes of Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended,
or any executive orders, rules or regulations relating thereto.

provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between the Company and
Seller (or its Affiliates), the Company agrees that Seller and its Affiliates
may share customary projections with respect to the Company and its business
with the Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter, and that

similar fee or make any other payment or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing. The

performance of their respective obligations under this **Section 6.09** or
any information utilized in connection therewith, except, solely in the case
of the Company, unless contingent upon or becoming effective substantially
concurrently with the Closing. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company (prior to Closing) and Seller and their Affiliates and Representatives

than information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Company expressly
for use in connection with offering documents or prospectuses or other
marketing materials for the Debt Financing or the Securities Requirements)

from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives), and this
indemnification shall survive termination of this Agreement and the Company
and Sellers Affiliates and Representatives shall be third party beneficiaries
of this sentence. Purchaser shall,

 **Section 7.06** **Debt Financing**.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " **Definitive Agreements** ") consistent with the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including all "market
flex" provisions thereof), (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Purchaser,
obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis, taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period, all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter,
Fee Letter and such Definitive Agreements (including payment of all fees and
expenses) and comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) maintain in effect
the Commitment Letters and Fee Letter in accordance with their terms and (iv)
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters, the Fee Letter and the
Definitive Agreements, as applicable, in the event of any breach or purported
breach thereof. Purchaser shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to take
or refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in a default under or failure of any of the
conditions contained in the Commitment Letters or in any Definitive Agreement
related to the Debt Financing.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its reasonable
best efforts to comply with its obligations, and enforce its rights, under the
Commitment Letters and any Definitive Agreements. Purchaser shall give Seller
prompt notice of any material breach (or

 



      
 

 



 

alleged or purported material breach) by any party to the Commitment Letters
of which Purchaser has become aware or any termination (or alleged or
purported termination) of the Commitment Letters. Purchaser shall keep Seller
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing and shall not permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or
remedy under, the Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver
or remedy (x) would materially delay the occurrence of the Closing, taking
into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, (y) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing (except as contemplated by the Commitment
Letters) or (z) adds new conditions or amends the existing conditions to the
drawdown of the Financing, unless Purchaser has available cash sufficient to
consummate the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to obtain the
Financing and compliance by Purchaser with this **Section 7.06(b)** shall not
relieve Purchaser of its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available.

 



 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any "flex provisions") contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, regardless of the reason therefor,
Purchaser will (i) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing
(the " **Alternative Debt Financing** ") (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with any then-available Debt Financing pursuant to any then-existing
Debt Commitment Letter, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses earned, due and payable as of
the Closing Date) on terms not less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser
than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter that the
Alternative Debt Financing would replace (taking into account any flex
provisions) from the same or other sources and that do not include any
incremental conditionality to the consummation of such Alternative Debt
Financing that are more onerous to Purchaser, Seller and the Company (in each
case, in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) as soon as
commercially practicable notify Seller of such unavailability and the reason
therefor.

 



 

(d) For purposes of the foregoing **Section 7.06(a)** through **Section
7.06(c)**, (i) the term " **Debt Commitment Letter** " shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any
Alternative Debt Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt
Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question), (ii) the term
" **Fee Letter** " shall be deemed to include any fee letter (or similar
agreement) and engagement letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any
Alternative Debt Financing arranged in compliance with this **Section 7.06**,
and (iii) the term " **Lenders** " shall be deemed to include any lenders
providing the Alternative Debt Financing arranged in compliance herewith.
Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall
provide Seller with reasonably prompt notice of (x) any breach, or default by
any Financing Source party to any Debt Commitment Letters that the Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel of Purchaser
gains actual knowledge and that such Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive
Officer or General Counsel reasonably believes would result in a Debt
Financing Failure and (y) the receipt of written notice or oral notice (only
to the extent that the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer or
General Counsel of Purchaser has actual knowledge of such oral notice) from
any Financing

 



      
 

 



 

Source party to any Debt Commitment Letters with respect to any breach or
default or, termination or repudiation by such Financing Source resulting in a
Debt Financing Failure.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not conditional upon the receipt by
Purchaser of the proceeds of the Financing.

 



 

 **Section 7.07** **Canal 3 Transaction Closing**. Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to close the
transactions contemplated by the Canal 3 PSA and satisfy all closing
conditions thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser, at Purchasers
sole discretion, may cure any breach of this **Section 7.07** by waiving the
condition in **Section 9.10** within 10 Business Days of receiving notice of
such breach from Seller (and such breach shall not be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement for purposes of the other provisions of this Agreement unless
such breach is uncured as of the expiration of such cure period); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Canal 3 PSA is terminated due to a
failure by Purchaser to cause its Affiliates to obtain financing to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Canal 3 PSA (a " **Canal 3 Financing
Failure** "), then **Section 9.10** shall be deemed waived. Purchaser shall
promptly give notice to Seller of any anticipated delays or issues satisfying
the condition in **Section 9.10**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to (i) amend or waive any term or
provision of the Canal 3 PSA (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
exhibits, schedules or annexes thereto) if such amendment or waiver would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impair or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Canal 3 PSA, unless
Purchaser waives **Section 9.10** simultaneously with such amendment or
waiver or (ii) agree to amend the Canal 3 PSA to extend the Termination Date
(as defined in the Canal 3 PSA) without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



 

 **Section 7.08** **Financial Assurances**. With respect to any Contract or
Lease that is assumed by or assigned to Company after giving effect to the
Pre-Closing Restructuring, Purchaser shall provide adequate assurance as
required under the Bankruptcy Code of the future performance by Purchaser of
each such Contract or Lease. Purchaser and Seller agree that they will
promptly take all actions reasonably required to assist in obtaining a
Bankruptcy Court finding that there has been an adequate demonstration of
adequate assurance of future performance under such Contract or Lease, such as
furnishing timely requested and factually accurate affidavits and other
documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making
Purchasers employees and Representatives available to testify before the
Bankruptcy Court.

that the Company (or such other Person designated by Purchaser in satisfaction
of its obligations under **Section 8.05**, in accordance with **Section
8.05(f)**) will remain bound by the terms and conditions of such agreements
until they expire, or are terminated or modified, in accordance with
applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 8.05** **Employee Matters.**

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing, Purchaser shall make offers to each Business Employee
with such offers of employment to be effective as of 12:01 A.M. Eastern time
on the Closing Date, unless such Business Employee is on a leave of absence on
the Closing Date, in which case Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, retain the employment of such Business Employees until, and such
employment offer will be effective as of when, the Business Employee is
available to return to active employment if such availability to return occurs
within six (6) months following the Closing Date (or any later date to the
extent such Business Employee has instatement, reinstatement, re-hire or
similar rights under applicable Law on such later date). Such offer shall
provide for substantially the same (i) salary, (ii) wages and (iii) target
annual bonus of employment as enjoyed by such Business Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date. By extending an offer, Purchaser agrees to hire any
Business Employee who chooses to accept such offer, and each Business Employee
who accepts such offer of employment from and commences employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliate is referred to herein as a " **Transferred
Employee** ". Except as otherwise specifically provided in this **Section
8.05** or as required by applicable Law, effective as of the Closing Date (or
with respect to Business Employees who are on a leave of absence as of the
Closing Date, the date on which such individual becomes a Transferred
Employee), the employment of the Transferred Employees with Seller shall
terminate and the Transferred Employees shall cease all active participation
in and accrual of benefits under any applicable Seller Employee Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms and conditions of employment for the
unionized Transferred Employees shall be as set forth in the applicable
collective bargaining agreement or as otherwise agreed by Purchaser and the
labor union representing such Transferred Employees.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As of Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be honored each Transferred
Employees (other than any Transferred Employee who is in the bargaining unit
covered by the collective bargaining agreement, which such Transferred
Employees shall be subject to the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement) accrued but unused vacation, paid time off and sick time under
NRGs paid time off plans or policies, but only to the extent included in
**Annex A** as adjustments to Working Capital and set forth in a schedule
delivered to Purchaser on the Closing Date (in accordance with **Section 8.04
**if applicable to such Business Employee).

 



 

(c) As of the Closing, Seller shall cause to be paid to each Transferred
Employee a pro-rata bonus based on the performance period occurring prior to
Closing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, Seller shall be
responsible and liable for providing, or continuing to provide, health care
continuation coverage as required under COBRA with respect to any individual
who experienced or experiences a COBRA "qualifying event" under any Seller
Employee Plan subject to COBRA.

 



 

(e) For purposes of payroll taxes with respect to Transferred Employees,
Seller and Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to treat the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
a transaction described in Treasury Regulation Sections 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b)(2)
and 31.3306(b)(1)-1(b)(2), and the parties further agree to implement this
treatment by utilizing Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, STANDARD
PROCEDURE FOR PREDECESSORS AND SUCCESSORS.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser may satisfy any
or all of its or the Companys obligations under **Section 8.04** and this
**Section 8.05 **(including, but not limited to, the provision of offers of
employment) by causing a Person designated by Purchaser to take action such
that Purchasers obligations are satisfied, and for purposes of **Section
8.04** and this **Section 8.05**, all references to the Company or Purchaser
or its Affiliates shall be deemed to include such Person. If and only if, such
Person assumes Purchasers obligations under this **Section 8.05** in writing
signed by such Person and acknowledges Sellers rights as a third party
beneficiary with respect to such obligations, Purchaser shall have no further
obligations with respect to this **Section 8.05**. In the event Purchaser
uses such Person to satisfy its obligations under this **Section 8.05** to
provide offers of employment to all Business Employees, Purchaser will require
such Person to assume the collective bargaining agreement set forth on
**Section 4.15(b)** of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (including each related
memorandum of understanding, letter of agreement, and other ancillary
agreement thereto) and apply its terms to those Transferred Employees in the
bargaining unit covered by such collective bargaining agreement.

 



 

(g) This **Section 8.05** shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
**Section 8.05**, express or implied, shall confer upon any Business
Employee, or any legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
under this Agreement. Nothing in this **Section 8.05**, express or implied,
shall be deemed to establish or amend any plan providing benefits to any
Business Employee or as altering the at-will nature of any Transferred
Employees employment.

 



   

     
 

 



 

 **Section 8.06** **Escrow Release**. The Parties agree that on the date that
is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall direct
the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller an amount equal to the difference
between the balance of the Escrow Amount less the aggregate amount of all
Losses claimed as Losses with respect to Seller and the Company immediately
prior to Closing subject to an indemnification obligation to the Purchaser
Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement in notifications delivered in
accordance with this Agreement. Any amounts so retained in the Escrow Account
shall remain therein until final resolution of the claims associated therewith
at which time, following application of **Section 11.06**, such amounts shall
be disbursed to Seller.

 



 

 **Section 8.07** **Release.**

 



 

(a) Except with respect to this Agreement, the other agreements and
instruments contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, from and after the Closing, Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its Affiliates and its and their respective successors and past, present
and future assigns (each, a " **Release Party** ") hereby absolutely and
unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company and its
Representatives (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its
Affiliates) from any and all Liabilities, claims, disputes, demands, rights or
cause of action (including any claims as to rights to compensation or other
benefit as to services rendered or otherwise) that any such Release Party ever
had, now has or hereafter may have against the Company and its Representatives
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its Affiliates), whether
known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, suspected or
unsuspected, both in law or in equity, whether related to any period of time
before or on the Closing Date (collectively, the " **Released Claims** ").

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, and except as specifically set forth in
**Section 11.03**, Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other
Release Party, hereby expressly waives any rights such Release Party may have
under applicable law to preserve Released Claims which such Release Party does
not know or suspect to exist in such Release Partys favor as of the date
hereof. Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Release Party,
understands and acknowledges that such Release Party may discover facts
different from, or in addition to, those which such Release Party knows or
believes to be true with respect to the claims released herein, and agrees
that the release provided in **Section 8.07(a)** shall be and remain
effective in all respects notwithstanding any subsequent discovery of
different or additional facts. If any Release Party discovers that any fact
relied upon in entering into the release provided in **Section 8.07(a)** was
untrue, or that any fact was concealed, or that an understanding of the facts
or law was incorrect, such Release Party shall not be entitled to any relief
as a result thereof, and Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other
Release Party, surrenders any rights such Release Party might have to rescind
the release provided in **Section 8.07(a)** on any ground. Such release is
intended to be and is final and binding regardless of any claim of
misrepresentation, promise made with the intention of performing, concealment
of fact, mistake of law, or any other circumstances whatsoever.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, and except as specifically set forth in
**Section 11.03**, Seller, on behalf of itself and the other Release Parties,
irrevocably covenants that it will not, and will ensure that no other Release
Party will, assert or attempt to assert any claim or

 



      
 

 



 

demand, or commence, institute or cause to be commenced, any proceeding of any
kind against the Company and its Representatives based upon any Released
Claim.

 



 

(d) Seller, on behalf of itself and the other Release Parties, represents and
warrants that it has not made any assignment or transfer of any Released
Claim.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing and except as otherwise agreed between
Purchaser and Seller, Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Release
Party, hereby absolutely and unconditionally waives any rights it or they may
have to acquire interests in Canal 3, including pursuant to that certain
Cooperation Agreement dated as of December 14, 2017, by and between Seller and
NRG.

 



 

 **Section 8.08** **Closing Conditions**. From the date hereof until the
Closing, and without prejudice to each Partys other obligations under this
Agreement, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions as are necessary to timely satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

the Plan).

have entered the Final Sale Order. The Purchaser shall constitute a

taken as a whole, that

 



      
 

 



 

would have, or be reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on

applicable survival period

 



      
 

 



 

shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and such claims shall survive
until finally resolved.

 



 

 **Section 11.02** **Indemnification by Seller**. From and after the Closing,
subject to the other terms and conditions of this **Article XI**, Seller
shall indemnify and defend each of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Company) and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " **Purchaser
Indemnitees** ") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Purchaser Indemnitees based
upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 



 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Seller or the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by or on behalf of Seller or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if
such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date,
the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date); and

 



 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 11.03** **Indemnification by Purchaser**. From and after the

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of

limitations:

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, any Losses payable to a
Purchaser Indemnitee for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty or failure to perform a covenant pursuant to **Section 11.02** shall
be satisfied solely as follows: (i) first, until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification thereof exceeds $1,600,000, Seller shall
not be responsible therefor, (ii) second, from the Escrow Account, to the
extent of the amounts remaining therein, but only in respect of individual
Loss items or related Loss items that equal or exceed $25,000, and (iii)
third, from the RandW Insurance Policy (to the extent covered

 



      
 

 



 

thereby). For the avoidance of doubt, the sole sources for recovery of claims
for Losses by a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be as set forth in this subsection
(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Purchaser
Indemnitee shall seek any recovery for indemnification under this Agreement
from any source or Person other than the Escrow Amount and the RandW Insurance
Policy.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this **Article XI**, the inaccuracy in or breach of, and
the amount of Losses with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, material adverse effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 



 

 **Section 11.05** **Indemnification Procedures**. The Party making a claim
under this **Article XI** is referred to as the " **Indemnified Party** ",
and the Party against whom such claims are asserted under this **Article XI**
is referred to as the " **Indemnifying Party** ".

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action or Proceeding made or brought by any
Person who is not a Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a Party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a " **Third Party Claim** ")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; _provided_ that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of
any such Third Party Claim that (x) is asserted directly by or on behalf of a
Person that is a supplier or customer of the Company, (y) seeks an injunction
or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or (z) where such
Third Party Claim could reasonably result in a claim solely against the RandW
Insurance Policy. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, subject to **Section 11.05(b)**, it shall have the
right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (i) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party or (ii) there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for
which

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to
promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as
provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to **Section
11.05(b)**, pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third Party Claim. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other
in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including making available records relating to such Third Party Claim
and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-
pocket expenses) to the defending Party, management employees of the non-
defending Party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if the Indemnifying Party asserts control over a Third Party
Claim pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter
into settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this **Section 11.05(b)**. If
the Indemnifying Party asserts control over a Third Party Claim pursuant to
paragraph (a) above, and a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim
without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary
form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) days
after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to **Section 11.05(a)**,
it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), solely to the extent that such settlement proceeds would be payable
from the Escrow Amount.

 



 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action or Proceeding by an Indemnified Party on
account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " **Direct
Claim** ") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct
Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Companys
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 11.06** **Payments; R andW Insurance Policy**.

 



 

(a) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this **Article XI**, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within twelve (12) Business Days of such final, non-
appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The
Parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment
of any such obligations within such 12-Business Day period, any amount payable
shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to and including the
date such payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to 18%. Such
interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year and the
actual number of days elapsed.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Purchaser
will purchase the RandW Insurance Policy on its own behalf at its own expense,
(ii) neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall be entitled to any proceeds from
the RandW Insurance Policy, (iii) any limits on indemnification in this
**Article XI** shall not limit the Purchasers rights under the RandW Insurance
Policy and (iv) to the extent that the procedures of the RandW Insurance Policy
conflict with the indemnification procedures in this **Article XI**, it shall
not be a breach of such procedures in this **Article XI** if the Purchaser
Indemnitees comply with such procedures of the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

 **Section 11.07** **Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments**. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 



 

 **Section 11.08** **Exclusive Remedies**. Subject to **Section 2.05**,
**Section 8.03** and **Section 13.08**, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that, from and after Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal activity or
willful misconduct on the part of a Party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this **Article XI**.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, from and after
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement it may have against the other Parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in Article VI and this **Article XI**. Nothing in this **Section
11.08** shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief
to which any Person

 



      
 

 



 

shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Partys fraudulent,
criminal or willful misconduct on the part of a Party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 12.01** **Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time by written
notice from Seller or Purchaser to the other (except for paragraph (a) below):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

 



 

(b) by either Purchaser or Seller:

 



 

(i) if the Closing has not occurred on or before the six (6) month anniversary
of the date of this Agreement (which date may be extended by any Party, by
notice to the other Parties, for one additional three (3) month period if (A)
one or more applicable Governmental or Regulatory Approvals have not been
obtained by the date that is six (6) months after the date of this Agreement
and (B) the lack of any such Governmental or Regulatory Approvals is the sole
reason that the unwaived conditions set forth in **Article IX** and **Article
X** to consummate the Closing are unfulfilled as of the date that is six (6)
months after the date of this Agreement) (the " **Termination Date** ");
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
**Section 12.01(b)(i)** shall not be available to a Party at any time that
such Party has violated, or is in breach of, any covenant, representation or
warranty hereunder, if such violation or breach would be reasonably expected
to prevent satisfaction of any of the non-breaching Partys conditions to
Closing hereunder (and such condition(s) has not been waived by the non-
breaching Party) or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured by the
breaching Party; _provided further_ that if the Termination Date (as defined
in the Canal 3 PSA) is extended pursuant to Section 12.01(b)(i) of the Canal 3
PSA, the Termination Date under this Agreement will automatically be extended
without further action by the Parties to the Termination Date under the Canal
3 PSA;

 



 

(ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other
Governmental or Regulatory Authority shall have issued a Final Order or
enacted any Law or taken any other final action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and such Order or Law or other action is or shall have become
final and nonappealable; or

 



 

(iii) under the circumstances set forth in, and in accordance with, **Section
8.01** or **Section 8.02**;

 



 

(c) at any time before the Closing, by Purchaser if there has been a breach by
Seller or the Company of any covenant, agreement or obligation contained in
this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Seller or the Company
is or shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set
forth in **Section 9.01** or **Section 9.02** would not be satisfied, and
such breach or inaccuracy is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured within
the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is
given to Seller by Purchaser and (B) the Termination Date; _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this **Section**

 



       
 

 



 

 **12.01(c)** shall not be available to Purchaser at any time that Purchaser
has violated, or is in breach of, any covenant, representation or warranty
hereunder, if such violation or breach has prevented satisfaction of any of
Sellers conditions to Closing hereunder (and such condition(s) has not been
waived by Seller) or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured by
Purchaser;

 



 

(d) at any time before the Closing, by Seller if there has been a breach by
Purchaser of any covenant, agreement or obligation contained in this Agreement
or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser is or shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in **Sections
10.01** or **Section 10.02** would not be satisfied, and such breach or
inaccuracy is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of
(A) thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given to Purchaser
by Seller and (B) the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no cure
period shall apply to Purchasers obligation to pay the Purchase Price. The
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this **Section 12.01(d)** shall
not be available to Seller at any time that Seller or the Company have
violated, or are in breach of, any covenant, representation or warranty
hereunder, if such violation or breach has prevented satisfaction of any of
Purchasers conditions to Closing hereunder (and such condition(s) has not
been waived by Purchaser) or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured by
Seller or the Company; or

 



 

(e) at any time before the Closing, by Seller if Purchaser has failed to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the date that the Closing
would have occurred, pursuant to and subject to the provisions of **Section
2.04**, if Purchaser had not failed to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and all of the conditions set forth in **Article IX**
would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred on such date;
_provided_ that, Seller and the Company are not then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause the conditions set forth in **Article IX** not to be
satisfied.

 



 

 **Section 12.02** **Effect of Termination**.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in this **Section 12.02**, if this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to **Section 12.01**, then this Agreement will
forthwith become null and void and there will be no liability or obligation on
the part of any Party or any other Person in respect of this Agreement other
than for any willful material breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination and for willful misconduct or actual fraud; _provided_ , that the
agreements of the Parties in **Article I**, **Section 6.09(b)**, **Section
7.05**, this **Section 12.02, Section 13.03**, and **Article XIII** will
continue to apply following any termination hereof.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding this **Section 12.02** or anything else in this Agreement
to the contrary, Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing
or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that Purchaser (or the
Company) obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
**Section 12.01(d)** or **Section 12.01(e)** (including with respect to any
Debt Financing Failure), then Purchaser shall promptly, but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to
be paid to Seller an amount equal to $16,000,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ")
by wire transfer of cash in immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated

 



      
 

 



 

by Seller. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Parties have
expressly negotiated the provisions of this **Section 12.02(c)**, (2) in
light of the circumstances existing at the time of the execution of this
Agreement (including the inability of the Parties to quantify the damages that
may be suffered by Seller and its Affiliates) the provisions of this **Section
12.02(c)** are reasonable, (3) the Termination Fee represents a good faith,
fair estimate of the damages that Seller and its Affiliates would suffer, and
(4) the Termination Fee shall be payable as liquidated damages (and not as a
penalty) without requiring Seller or any other Person to prove actual damages.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Purchaser fails to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in breach of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement, Seller may, in its sole
discretion: (i) seek specific performance pursuant to **Section 13.08**; (ii)
withdraw any claim for specific performance and require payment of the
Termination Fee if applicable under **Section 12.02(c)**; or (iii) if Seller
is unable for any reason to obtain specific performance, require payment of
the Termination Fee if applicable under **Section 12.02(c)**. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall (x) the Purchaser be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, (y) the Purchaser be liable
for any damages under this Agreement in excess of the Termination Fee or
specific performance or (z) the Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates be entitled to both specific performance pursuant to **Section
13.08** and the Termination Fee.

 



 

(e) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser has delivered
to Seller a limited guarantee, dated the date hereof, of Stonepeak
Infrastructure Fund II LP (the " **Guarantor** "), guaranteeing Purchasers
obligations pursuant to this **Section 12.02**, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein (the " **Limited Guarantee** ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 13.01** **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement and the agreements
and documents referred to herein contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or
oral, relating to such subject matter in any way (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement). The Parties have voluntarily agreed
to define their rights, liabilities and obligations with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms-length negotiations and shall not be deemed to create a partnership
between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, and no Person has any other special
relationship with another Person that would justify any expectation beyond
that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length
transaction.

 



 

 **Section 13.02** **Expenses; Payments**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Party shall pay its own
costs and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses, and, other than as provided in **Section 13.02(b)**, Seller shall
pay the costs and expenses of the Company immediately prior to Closing
incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Transaction Fees and Expenses.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall pay all costs and expenses (other than the costs and
expenses for Sellers Representatives) associated with (i) filings under the
HSR Act, (ii) obtaining all Governmental or Regulatory Approvals and (iii)
pursuant to **Section 11.06(b)**, obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

(c) Each Party agrees that, where not otherwise specified, all amounts
required to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and,
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount,
rebate or reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset, on the dates
specified herein (with time being of the essence). Subject to the provisions
of **Section 2.05** (which shall govern any dispute arising thereunder), in
the event any Action or Proceeding is commenced or threatened by any Person to
enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other Person, if the
defendant in such Action or Proceeding is the prevailing party in such Action
or Proceeding, all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and court costs, incurred by such prevailing party in connection with
such Action or Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party in
such Action or Proceeding; _provided_ that if the defendant in such Action or
Proceeding prevails in part, and loses in part, the court, arbitrator or other
adjudicator presiding over such Action or Proceeding shall award a
reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by such defendant on an
equitable basis. For purposes hereof, and without limitation, the defendant
shall be deemed to have prevailed in any Action or Proceeding if the Person
attempting to enforce its rights hereunder commences or threatens any such
Action or Proceeding and (i) such underlying claim(s) are subsequently
dropped, voluntarily dismissed or voluntarily reduced and/or (ii) such
defendant defeats any such claim(s).

 



 

 **Section 13.03** **Confidentiality**.

 



 

(a) Each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates and Representatives to,
hold, in strict confidence, all documents and information concerning another
Party or any of its Affiliates furnished to it by another Party or such other
Partys Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " **Confidential Information** "), and
treat all such Confidential Information as proprietary, secret and
confidential; _provided_ , _however_ , that, solely for the purposes of this
**Section 13.03**, the portfolio companies or other investments of funds
advised by Stonepeak Partners LP shall be deemed Affiliates of the Purchaser
to the extent Stonepeak Partners LP or any of its subsidiaries receives
Confidential Information; _provided further_ that from and after the Closing,
(x) such confidentiality obligations of Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Representatives shall terminate with respect to all Confidential Information
other than with respect to any Confidential Information that relates
exclusively to Seller or Sellers Affiliates (other than the Company
immediately prior to Closing) and (y) all Confidential Information relating to
the Company or its businesses or operations shall be deemed to be the
Confidential Information of Purchaser. Except with respect to Purchaser to the
extent Purchasers confidentiality obligations are terminated from and after
the Closing pursuant to the previous sentence, in no event shall either Party
distribute to third parties any Confidential Information;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this **Section 13.03** shall limit
the disclosure by any Party of any Confidential Information:

 



 

(i) to the extent required by Law or Order ( _provided_ that the disclosing
Party agrees to give the non-disclosing Party prompt and reasonably sufficient
written notice thereof so as to enable the non-disclosing Party to seek a
protective order, oppose any action by the disclosing Party, or pursue any
other appropriate remedy, if so desired by the non-disclosing Party). If such
a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the non-disclosing
Party, in its sole discretion, waives in writing compliance with this
Agreement, the disclosing Party (or such other Person required to disclose the
Confidential Information) may disclose only that portion of the Confidential
Information that it is legally required to disclose to avoid contempt or other
penalty in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the disclosing Party (or such
other Person required to disclose the Confidential Information), and shall
exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information so
disclosed;

 



 

(ii) in an Action or Proceeding brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or
in the exercise of its remedies under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby;

 



 

(iii) to the extent that such Confidential Information can be shown to have
come within the public domain through no action or omission of the disclosing
Party or its Affiliates or Representatives; and

 



 

(iv) later acquired by the receiving Party from another source if the
receiving Party is not aware that such source is under an obligation to
another Party hereto to keep such Confidential Information confidential.

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Confidential Information may include materials
subject to the attorney-client privilege, Seller is not waiving, and Seller
will not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney work-product
protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges
as a result of disclosing any Confidential Information (including Confidential
Information related to pending or threatened litigation) to Purchaser, its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives, regardless of whether Seller
has asserted or is or may be entitled to assert such privileges and
protections. In furtherance of the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates shall claim or contend, in proceedings involving either Party, that
Seller waived its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client
privileges or similar protections and privileges with respect to any
information, documents or other material (whether or not disclosed to
Purchaser or its Affiliates) due to Sellers disclosure of Confidential
Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or
threatened litigation) to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives.

 



 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with **Section
12.01**, upon the written request of either Party, the other Party will, and
will cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, promptly (and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after such written request) redeliver or
destroy and certify in writing (email to suffice) as destroyed, or cause to be
redelivered or destroyed and certified in writing (email to suffice) as
destroyed (as requested by such Party), all copies of Confidential Information
furnished by such other Party in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and all notes,
memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings related to or
based on such information or documents prepared by the Party furnished with
such Confidential Information or its Affiliates or Representatives.

 



 

 **Section 13.04** **Announcements**. From the date of this Agreement until,
or in connection with, the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall not issue or
make any reports, statements or releases to the public or generally to the
employees, customers, suppliers or other Persons to whom the Company sells
goods or provides services or with whom the Company otherwise has significant
business relationships with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that
for purposes of clarity, the foregoing shall not restrict such disclosures (a)
that are necessary for the procurement of any required consents, approvals,
payoff letters and similar documentation, (b) made by a Party to its
Representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of its
business or the negotiation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder or (c) that a Party determines in good faith, after consultation
with legal counsel, is required by Law in order to discharge such Partys or
its Affiliates disclosure obligations; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
case of a disclosure pursuant to clause (c), the disclosing Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other Parties reasonable time to
comment on such disclosure in advance of making such disclosure and shall
promptly furnish the other Parties with a copy thereof. Seller, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall also obtain the other Partys
prior approval of any press release to be issued immediately following the
Closing announcing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall have the right to contact the Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities with whom the filings identified in Items 8 and 9 of **Section
4.04 **of the **Seller Disclosure Schedule** are made to discuss how such
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities are responding to such filings;
_provided_ that Seller shall be permitted to participate in such contact and
discussions.

 



 

 **Section 13.05** **No Waiver**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may
be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof,
but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument
duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
any other term or condition of this Agreement on any prior or future occasion.

 



 

 **Section 13.06** **Amendments**. Any provision of this Agreement may be
modified, supplemented or waived only by an instrument in writing duly
executed by Purchaser and Seller. Any such modification, supplement or waiver
shall be for such period and subject to such conditions as shall be specified
in the instrument effecting the same and shall be binding upon each of
Purchaser and Seller, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purposes for which given. No course of dealing
between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be
deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or
any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this **Section
13.06**, or any of **Section 13.12**, **Section 13.16**, **Section 13.17**
or **Section 13.20 **(or to any other provision or definition of this
Agreement to the extent that such amendment or waiver would modify the
substance of any

 



      
 

 



 

such foregoing Section or defined term used therein) shall not be amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a manner materially adverse to
the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

 



 

 **Section 13.07** **Addresses for Notices**. All notices and other
communications required or permitted to be given or made under this Agreement
shall be given or made in writing, by physical (including by mail or courier)
or facsimile or electronic mail delivery to the address specified below or
such other address as shall be designated in a notice in writing. Notices will
be effective and deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered, sent
by fax or email (with hard copy to follow) or sent by reputable overnight
express courier (charges prepaid), or (b) three (3) calendar days following
mailing by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt
requested.

 **Section 13.08** **Specific Performance**.

 



 

(a) Each Party acknowledges that the rights of each Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and affirm that in
the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached, money damages
would be inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching Party would have no
adequate remedy at law) and the non-breaching Party would be irreparably
damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, subject to **Section 12.02**,
(a) each other Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction
or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security or
needing to prove irreparable harm or damages) to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any state or
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, New
York, in addition to any other remedy to which such Person may be entitled, at
law or in equity, and (b) the right of specific performance and other
equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right as provided in this **Section 13.08**, none
of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties hereto
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable
relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the Parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
If, on or prior to the Termination Date, any Party brings any action, in each
case in accordance with the terms hereof, to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the period during
which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (y) by such other
time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case
may be. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) in no event shall
this **Section 13.08**, be used, alone or together with any other provision
of this Agreement, to require any Party to remedy any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by such Party herein and (y) Purchaser
expressly acknowledges that nothing contained in this sentence shall restrict
Seller from enforcing specifically the obligations of Purchaser set forth in
**Section 7.06(c)**.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance
of Purchasers obligation to cause the Equity Financing to occur or to cause
Purchaser to effect the Closing in accordance with **Section 2.04**, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, if and only
in the event that (i) all of the conditions set forth in **Article IX** have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their nature
cannot be satisfied until Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing
and (iii) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then it reasonably believes that the Closing pursuant to **Section 2.04**

 **Section 13.09** **Captions**. The captions and section headings appearing
in this Agreement are included solely for convenience of reference and are not
intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 13.10** **Severability**. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Furthermore, in lieu
of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

 



 

 **Section 13.11** **Assignment**. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by any Party (including by operation of law) without the prior
written consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
may assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate or
Affiliates of Purchaser, or to Purchasers lenders for collateral security
purposes, but such assignment shall not release Purchaser from its obligations
hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 13.12** **No Third-Party Beneficiary**. The terms and provisions
of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each Party hereto and
their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention
of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person
other than with respect to the Indemnified Employees under **Section 7.04**,
the Purchaser Indemnitees under **Section 11.02**, the Seller Indemnitees
under **Section 11.03**, the Non-Party Affiliates identified in **Section
13.13(b)**, KandE under **Section 13.19,** and the Financing Sources under
**Section 13.15, Section 13.16, Section 13.17**, **Section 13.20** and the
proviso of **Section 13.06**, each of which provisions is intended to be for
the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or to be paid thereunder and may be
enforced by such Person.

ARISING WITH RESPECT TO THE PROJECT OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS OR RIGHTS OF ACTION UNDER CERCLA OR ANY OTHER
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

 



 

(b) All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the
Persons that are expressly identified as Parties. No Person who is not a named
Party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future direct or
indirect director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner,
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any named
Party to this Agreement (such Persons, collectively, " **Non-Party
Affiliates** "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an
entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any obligations or
liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its
negotiation or execution, and each Party waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.

this **Section 13.13(b)**.

 



 

 **Section 13.14** **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument and any of the Parties to this Agreement may execute this
Agreement by signing any such counterpart. In the event that any signature is
delivered by facsimile transmission or by email delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same
force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an
original thereof. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties.

 



 

 **Section 13.15** **Governing Law**. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware and any and all claims, controversies, disputes,
suits, proceedings and causes of action arising out of or relating to this

the laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations,
without giving effect to any conflict of law or other rule that would result
in the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any right or obligation with respect to any Financing Source
in connection with the Debt Financing and the Debt Commitment Letter shall be
interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York.

 



 

 **Section 13.16** **Consent to Jurisdiction**.

 



 

(a) For all purposes of this Agreement (other than **Section 2.05(b)**, which

contemplated hereby, each Party hereto submits to the personal jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts within the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New

such Action or Proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York court

by law, in such federal court; _provided_ that each Party hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such Action or Proceeding may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or

registered mail, return receipt requested, of any process required by any such
court shall constitute valid and lawful service of process against them,
without necessity for service by any other means provided by statute or rule
of court; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or at
equity.

 



 

(i) Each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so: (i) any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action or Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any state and
federal courts within the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, New
York; and (ii) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
Action or Proceeding in any such court.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and without
limitation of the rights of the Financing Sources set forth in **Section
13.20**, the Parties hereby agree that they will not bring or support, or
permit any of their Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support, any
suit, proceeding, action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party
claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York, New York, and the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and any appellate courts thereof, and hereby irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court.

 



 

 **Section 13.17** **Waiver of Jury Trial**. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THAT OTHERWISE
RELATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND/OR THE
RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER, INCLUDING ANY LEGAL
ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING OR ANY CLAIM OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING OR AGAINST
ANY FINANCING SOURCE.

 



 

 **Section 13.18** **Disclosure**. Any fact or item disclosed in any section
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed in each other
section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to which such fact or item may apply
so long as (a) such other section is referenced by applicable cross-reference
or (b) it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable such other
section. The headings contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence
the interpretation of the information

 



       
 

 



 

contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement. The Seller
Disclosure Schedule is not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed
as, an admission or indication that any such fact or item is required to be
disclosed. Any fact or item disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall
not by reason only of such inclusion be deemed to be material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement and matters reflected in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected herein and may be included solely for information purposes. No
disclosure in the Seller Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach
or violation of any Contract, Law or order shall be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. The information contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be
kept strictly confidential by the Parties and no third party may rely on any
information disclosed or set forth therein.

 



 

 **Section 13.19** **Legal Representation**. Purchaser agrees and will cause
the Company to agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their directors,
managers, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates and each of
their successors and assigns (all such parties, the " **Waiving Parties** "),
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (" **K andE**") (or any successor thereto) may
represent Seller or any direct or indirect director, manager, member, partner,
officer, employee, equityholder, Affiliate or other Representative of Seller,
in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any agreement entered into in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby (any such
representation, the " **Post-Closing Representation** ") notwithstanding its
representation (or any continued representation) of the Company, and Purchaser
consents thereto and will cause the Company to consent thereto on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties, and Purchaser irrevocably waives (and will not
assert) and will cause the Company to irrevocably waive (and not assert) any
conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom or relating thereto.
Purchaser acknowledges and will cause the Company to acknowledge that the
foregoing provision applies whether or not KandE provides legal services to the
Company after the Closing Date. Purchaser irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
and will cause the Company to irrevocably acknowledge and agree, for itself
and the Waiving Parties, that all communications among KandE, the Company,
Seller and/or any director, officer, manager, member, employee or other
Representative of any of the foregoing made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreement entered into in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated
hereby or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged
communications and the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to solely to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the Company and from and after
the Closing none of Purchaser, the Company or any Person purporting to act on
behalf of or through Purchaser, the Company or any of the Waiving Parties,
will seek to obtain the same by any process. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not
assert and will cause the Company to waive and not assert any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication among KandE, the Company, Seller
and/or any director, officer, manager, member, employee or other
Representative of any of the foregoing occurring prior to the Closing in
connection with any Post-Closing Representation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser or the
Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than Seller, on the other
hand, Purchaser and the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that

 



      
 

 



 

none of Purchaser or the Company may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of Seller and none of Seller or its Affiliates may waive such
privilege without the written consent of Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 13.20** **Financing Sources**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Seller and any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, and each of their successors or permitted assigns, (i) hereby
agree that none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or
obligation to Seller and any of its Affiliates or Representatives relating to,
and waive any rights or claims against each of the Financing Sources relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or
in equity and whether in tort, contract or otherwise, (ii) hereby agree not to
bring or support any suit, action or proceeding against any Financing Source
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or
in equity and whether in tort, contract or otherwise and (iii) hereby agree to
cause any suit, action or proceeding asserted against any Financing Source by
or on behalf of the Seller and any of its Affiliates or Representatives, and
each of their successors or permitted assigns in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby to be dismissed or otherwise terminated.
Nothing in this Section 13.20 shall limit the rights of Purchaser in respect
of the Debt Financing under any Commitment Letter, related Fee Letters or any
definitive documentation in respect of the foregoing. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing waivers and agreements, it is acknowledged and
agreed that no Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or
damages to Seller and any of its Affiliates or Representatives, and each of
their successors or permitted assigns in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Without limiting the foregoing, the Financing Sources
shall be beneficiaries of all limitations on remedies and damages in this
Agreement that apply to Purchaser hereto and are express third party
beneficiaries of this **Section 13.20**.
