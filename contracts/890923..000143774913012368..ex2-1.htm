WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Boar_ d") and
the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each

or any other Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) Dissenting Shares, and (iii) Shares
owned by the Company in treasury or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company (each Share referred to in clauses (i) through (iii)
above being an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")
shall be converted into the right to receive $16.75 in cash (the " _Per Share
Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 3.1 shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of such Shares formerly
represented thereby, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Except as provided in the second
sentence of this Section 3.1(b), each Excluded Share, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be automatically canceled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the
Record Holders of any Dissenting Shares to demand appraisal with respect to
such Dissenting Shares or to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by Section 3.2(f). Each Excluded Share that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall remain
outstanding, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. As used in this Article 3, the term " _Record Holder_ " means, with
respect to any Shares, a Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the holder of record of such Shares.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Payment._

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into
an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
shareholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the
shareholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a).
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). If a Dissenting Shareholder effectively withdraws its
demand for, or loses its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 351.455 of the
Missouri Law with respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall make
available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent additional funds
in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Dissenting Shares for
which the Dissenting Shareholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its,
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 351.455 of the Missouri Law and (ii) the
Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $25.0 billion, or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts payable
under Section 3.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent (or its designee).
To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments,
or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for
the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 3.1(a), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such aggregate payments under Section 3.1(a).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third business day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each Record Holder, as of the Effective Time, of
an outstanding Certificate or outstanding Certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, which have converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect
thereto, a form of letter of transmittal in customary form and reasonable
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate and such Certificate shall then be
canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the third business day following the Effective Time (or, solely if delivery of
a letter of transmittal (which letter of transmittal shall be in customary
form and shall have such provisions as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree) by each Record Holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") is required by the Paying Agent, promptly
following the Paying Agent's receipt of such letter of transmittal), the
Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each Record Holder of Book-Entry
Shares a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement in respect of
such Book-Entry Shares, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent that such tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.2(b), each Certificate (other than with respect to Excluded Shares)
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article 3.

 



 

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate
to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
(" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 10:30 a.m.
(St. Louis time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares other than Excluded Shares held of record
by DTC or such nominee as of the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share
Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the
Closing occurs after 10:30 a.m. (St. Louis time) on the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first business day
after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal
to the DTC Payment.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Person presents to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent any
Certificates for transfer or any transfer instructions relating to Shares
canceled in the Merger, such Person shall be given a copy of the letter of
transmittal referred to in Section 3.2(b)(i) and directed to comply with the
instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive any cash to
which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article 3.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At the option of the Surviving
Corporation, any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Record Holders of Shares
for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation (or its designee). Any Record Holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws) only as a general creditor thereof for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Shares upon compliance
with the instructions in the form of letter of transmittal referred to in
Section 3.2(b)(i), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. All cash paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-
for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Authority or
other entity of any kind or nature.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder's
compliance with customary replacement requirements reasonably established by
the Paying Agent, including the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may reasonably be required
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate pursuant to this Article 3.

 



 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
351.455 of the Missouri Law (the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled only to such
rights as are accorded under Section 351.455 of the Missouri Law (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set
forth in Section 351.455 of the Missouri Law), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its
right to appraisal under the Missouri Law. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holder's Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section 3.1, without
interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demand for
appraisal, attempted withdrawal of such demand, and any other instrument
served pursuant to Applicable Laws that are received by the Company relating
to Company shareholders' rights of appraisal. Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal by Company shareholders under the Missouri Law. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demand for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demand or
approve any withdrawal of any such demand.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled, without duplication, to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of
Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other
applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i) timely remitted by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Record Holder of Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans._

 



 

(a) _Options_. As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares

Directors Stock Option Plan (as Amended and Restated), the Zoltek Companies,
Inc. 2003 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, the Zoltek Companies, Inc. 2008
Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, and the Zoltek Companies, Inc. 2008 Director
Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), which, in each
case, is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable and, at the
Effective Time, shall be canceled by the Company and converted into the right
to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay), promptly following the Effective Time (but in
no event later than the third business day following the Effective Time), in
consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to (i) the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _times_ (y) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such
Company Option less (ii) any amounts required to be withheld or deducted with
respect to such payment and without interest. In the event that the exercise
price of any Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time
without payment therefor and have no further force or effect.

 



 

(b) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
the Company Board and the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall
take all actions necessary in order to implement the provisions of this
Section 3.3 and pay all amounts due as of the Closing to J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC (" _J.P. Morgan_ ") under the agreements described in Section
4.18.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the
Company changes the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication,
to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of
such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.5 _Rule 16b-3 Approval_. Prior to the Closing, the Company and
the Company Board or a committee thereof, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all actions to cause any disposition of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ") by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "), to be exempt from Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
in accordance with the procedures set forth in such Rule 16b-3.

 



 

ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except as (i) set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent and
Merger Sub by the Company at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
" _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular
section or subsection of this Agreement (provided that any information set
forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof where its
relevance to such other section is reasonably apparent on its face from such
disclosure) or (ii) disclosed or included in the Company Reports filed with,
or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") by the Company since October 1, 2012 and publicly available prior to
the date hereof (other than any disclosures set forth in any "risk factor"
section, in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any other
disclosures included therein, in each case to the extent that they are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature and provided that nothing
in this clause (ii) shall be deemed to modify or qualify the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. The Company
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Missouri. The Company is duly qualified to do
business and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the
relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction
in which the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company possesses all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate
and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The
Company has heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent true,
complete and correct copies of the Company's amended and restated articles of
incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") and by-laws (the " _Company By-Laws_
") as in effect on the date hereof. The Company Charter and the Company By-
Laws are in full force and effect.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and, upon receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, to
consummate the Transactions. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
all requisite corporate action on behalf of the Company, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions other than, with respect to
the Merger, the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company has
duly executed and delivered this Agreement. Assuming this Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, this
Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights, general
principles of equity and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of: (i) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "); and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $ 0.01 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "). No shares of
Company Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. As of September 24, 2013
(the " _Measurement Date_ "): (i) 34,390,922 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding; (ii) zero shares of Company Common Stock were
held in treasury; and (iii) an aggregate of 1,178,416 shares of Company Common
Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Company Options.
All issued and outstanding Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. Since the Measurement Date, except for
this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company
Options and as set forth above, (i) there are no outstanding (A) shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company, (B) securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company, or (C) options, warrants, calls or other rights to
acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or commitments which
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, sell or
register, any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
Company (the items in clauses (A), (B) and (C) are referred to collectively as
" _Company Securities_ "), and (ii) there are no outstanding obligations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Company Securities. The Company has no outstanding
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on any matter.
There are no outstanding contractual commitments of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which obligate the Company or its Subsidiaries to make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
other Person. There is no shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" anti-takeover
plan or other similar device in effect to which the Company is a party or is
otherwise bound. With respect to the Company Options issued pursuant to the
Stock Plans (i) each grant of an option was duly authorized no later than the
date on which the grant of such option was by its terms to be effective on the
date the option was granted (the " _Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate
action and was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto within a
reasonable time following the Grant Date and no such grants involved any "back
dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect to the effective
date of grant, (ii) all options have an exercise price equal to no less than
the fair market value of one share of Company Common Stock on the Grant Date
and no option has any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the
deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or disposition
of such option, in each case, as determined in accordance with Section 409A of
the Code, (iii) each such grant of Company Options was made in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Stock Plan and all applicable laws, (iv) the Stock
Plans are the only plans or programs the Company maintains under which
outstanding options to acquire Company Common Stock or any other equity or
equity-based awards have been or may be granted and there are no options to
acquire Company Common Stock or any other equity-based awards with respect to
Company Common Stock outstanding other than those granted and outstanding
under the Stock Plans, (v) the Company has made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of each form of award agreement, (vi) no Company
Options differ in any material respect from such form agreements, (vii) except
as set forth in Section 4.3(a)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is
no agreement, arrangement or understanding (written or oral) to amend, modify
or supplement such Company Options in any case from the form provided to
Parent, and (viii) each such grant was properly accounted for in all material
respects in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") in the financial statements (including the
related notes) of the Company. No Company Option is intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. Except as set forth in
Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter and the Voting Agreement,
there are no shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
of which the Company has knowledge with respect to the holding, voting,
registration, redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the
transfer of, any capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Section 4.3(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and complete list, as of the date
of this Agreement, of all outstanding Company Options and other rights to
purchase or receive shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Stock
Plans, any sub-plan thereto or otherwise, and, for each such Company Option
and other right, (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto, (ii) the terms of vesting (including the extent to which it will
become accelerated as a result of the Merger) and vested status, (iii) the
grant and expiration dates, (iv) the Stock Plan and form of award agreement
pursuant to which such grant was made, (v) the exercise price, if applicable,
and (vi) the name of the holder thereof. All Company Options can be
involuntarily cancelled without the award holder's consent upon the
consummation of the Merger (including any options that have an exercise price
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, and therefore with respect
to which no payment will be made in connection with such cancellation).

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.4 _Subsidiaries_. Section 4.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a true, complete and correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the
Company. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited
liability company or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and,
to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the corporate or other entity power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business
and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which
the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth in Section 4.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter, all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in each
of the Company's Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by
Applicable Laws), and are owned by the Company or another wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all mortgages, deeds of trust,
liens, security interests, pledges, rights of way, hypothecation, charge,
claim, option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, community property
interest, easements, encumbrances or restriction of any nature (including any
restriction on the voting of any security, any restriction on the transfer of
any security or other asset, any restriction on the possession, exercise or
transfer of any other attribute of ownership of any asset) (" _Liens_ ") other
than Permitted Liens. Except for the capital stock of its Subsidiaries, the
Company does not own any capital stock or other equity or voting interest in
any Person.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except for such matters
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole:

 



 

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is, and since
January 1, 2011 none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been, in
violation of any applicable federal, state, local, municipal, foreign or other
law, statute, constitution, principle of common law, ordinance, code, rule,
regulation, order, ruling, decree, judgment, or other legal requirement
issued, enacted, adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise put into
effect by or under the authority of any Governmental Authority (collectively,
" _Applicable Laws_ "), and no claim, investigation or proceeding is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any such
matters.

 



 

(b) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company hold all permits,
licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders, franchises, consents
and approvals of all governmental or regulatory entities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "). All Company Permits are in full force and effect, and
there exists no default thereunder or breach thereof, and none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has notice or actual knowledge that such Company
Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course after the Effective Time.
No Governmental Authority has given notice to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that it has taken or intends to take any action to terminate,
suspend, cancel or reform any Company Permit.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.6 _Real Property._ Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a true and complete list of all material real property owned, leased,
subleased or otherwise occupied by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
" _Company Real Property_ "). The Company or the applicable Subsidiary has
good, valid and marketable fee title to all Company Real Property owned in
fee, subject to Permitted Liens, and, with respect to all other Company Real
Property, has good and valid leasehold, sublease, license or other interest or
otherwise has a valid right of possession, use or access which is sufficient
to permit the Company to operate or conduct its business as is currently
conducted or carried. The Company and its Subsidiaries possess all permits,
deeds, leases, licenses, easements, rights of way, surface rights, operating
authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises, variances, consents, approvals
and such other similar agreements granting rights in real property or other
authorizations (" _Real Property Agreements_ ") required for the present
ownership and operation of all Company Real Property. Each Real Property
Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, the other party thereto, and, except for expirations in accordance
with the terms thereof, is in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws relating to creditors' rights, general principles of equity
and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company has made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of all material Real
Property Agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any unresolved notice of any default on
the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Real Property
Agreement, and to the knowledge of the Company, there is no default on the
part of the other party or parties under the provisions of any Real Property
Agreement. None of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has received
notice of any condemnation proceeding or proposed action or agreement for
taking in lieu of condemnation, nor is any such proceeding, action or
agreement pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing,

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established and administered in
accordance with its terms, and in compliance with the applicable provisions of

Employees, except as required to avoid an excise tax under Section 4980B of
the Code or otherwise as may be required pursuant to any other Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions could cause any payments to any Company Employee to be either
subject to an excise tax or non-deductible under Sections 4999 and 280G of the
Code, whether or not some other subsequent action or event would be required
to cause such payment, right or benefit to be triggered.

 



 

(f) Each Company Benefit Plan providing for deferred compensation that
constitutes a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section

result in any payment becoming due to any current or former employee,
consultant, independent contractor or director of the Company, (ii) increase
the compensation or benefits payable, including equity benefits, under any
Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
funding or vesting of any such compensation or benefits, including equity
benefits, under any such Company Benefit Plan, (iv) require any contributions
or payments to fund any obligations under any Company Benefit Plan, (v) create
any limitation or restriction on the right of the Company to merge, amend or

Parent nor Merger Sub has any rights with respect to such opinion. A true,

this Agreement, sets forth a true and complete list of each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding to which the Company or a Subsidiary
is a party: (i) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10)(i-ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC or required to be disclosed by
the Company on a Current Report on Form 8-K); (ii) that generates or is
expected to generate revenues to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in

that relates to a swap or hedging transaction or other derivative agreement
for an annual net amount in excess of $1 million; (v) that contains
restrictions on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or which,
following the Closing, would contain restrictions that would purport to
restrict the ability of Parent or its Affiliates) to engage in activities
competitive with any Person or to solicit customers or suppliers anywhere in
the world that would be material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (vi) that relates to a joint development
partnership or other partnership, joint venture or similar arrangement, unless
immaterial to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (vii) that
relates to any acquisition of a business by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
material continuing "earn out" or other contingent or fixed payment
obligations; (viii) that is a settlement or similar contract with any
Governmental Authority or that is any other settlement or similar contract
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to pay
consideration after the date of this Agreement in excess of $100,000; or (ix)
that is a Labor Contract. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this Section 4.21(a), whether nor not
set forth in Section 4.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and any
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of such type entered into
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, is referred to herein as a "
_Material Contract_ "). The Company has made available to Parent true,
complete and correct copies of all Material Contracts in effect on the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, do not
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) each Material Contract is
valid and binding on the Company or its Subsidiary party thereto and to the
knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto; (ii) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) is in violation or default under any Material
Contract or (B) has received notice of any asserted violation or default by
the Company or its Subsidiary party thereto under any Material Contract; (iii)
to the knowledge of the Company, no event or condition exists which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a
violation or default under any Material Contract, and no other party to such
Material Contract is in default in any respect thereunder; and (iv) each
Material Contract is enforceable by the Company or its Subsidiary party
thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to creditors' rights, general principles of equity and any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 



 

Section 4.22 _Takeover Statutes; Rights Plans_. Assuming the accuracy of
Parent and Merger Sub's representations in Section 5.10, the Company has taken
all action necessary to render Sections 351.407 and 351.459 of the Missouri
Law inapplicable to the Merger and the Transactions, and accordingly, none of

or regulation applies to the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Company does not have any preferred share purchase rights plan or similar
rights plan in effect.

 



 

Section 4.23 _Title, Ownership and Related Matters_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens,
defensible title to their respective inventory, equipment and other tangible
and intangible property, rights and assets, in each case as necessary to
permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses
as currently conducted. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Permitted
Liens_ " shall mean routine statutory Liens securing liabilities and Liens for
taxes not yet due and payable or being contested in good faith and for which
adequate reserves or accruals have been established; Liens existing or
expressly permitted pursuant to credit facilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries set forth in Section 4.23(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
refinancings thereof; Liens that would be permitted under Section 6.1 hereof;
Liens imposed or promulgated by Applicable Laws with respect to real property
and improvements, including zoning regulations, none of which are violated by

Disclosure Letter.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.24 _Proxy Statement._

 



 

(a) The proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of the Company in
connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as
amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Proxy
Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the
time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

of its actions for, or on behalf of, any of them (a) knowingly used any

ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by
Parent at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular section or
subsection of this Agreement (provided that any information set forth in one
section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply
to each other section or subsection thereof where its relevance to such other
section is reasonably apparent on its face from such disclosure), Parent and
Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company that:

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business
and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which
the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified, or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, does not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has heretofore furnished or otherwise
made available to the Company true, complete and correct copies of its
articles of incorporation and by-laws or equivalent organizational documents,
as in effect as of the date hereof. The organizational and governing documents
of Parent and Merger Sub are in full force and effect.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. No vote
of the holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement and the Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
and to consummate the Transactions. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of Parent and Merger
Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.
Assuming this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Company, this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligations of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to creditors' rights, general principles of equity and any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 



 

Section 5.3 _No Conflict._

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement nor the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions in
accordance with the terms hereof or thereof will: (i) conflict with or result
in a breach of any provision of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of
Parent and Merger Sub or equivalent organizational documents; (ii) violate, or
conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or cancellation or
in a right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties,
assets or rights of Parent or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being
declared void, voidable or without further binding effect, or otherwise result
in a detriment to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, concession, franchise, permit,
lease, sublease, contract or agreement to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties, assets or rights may be bound or affected; or
(iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 5.3(b),
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any their respective
properties, assets or rights are bound, except for such matters, in the case
of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement nor the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions in
accordance with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval,
qualification, authorization or permit of, action by, filing or registration
with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority other than (i) Regulatory
Filings and the filings and notifications required under applicable Non-U.S.
Antitrust Laws in the jurisdictions listed in Section 5.3(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Missouri, and (iii) any filing, consent,
approval, qualification, authorization, permit, decision or action, the
failure of which to obtain, and for any such filing, registration or
notification the failure of which to make, does not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, there is no suit, action or proceeding by or
before any Governmental Authority pending, or to Parent's knowledge,
threatened, to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or against Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their properties or assets. There is no suit, action or
proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority pending, or to Parent's
knowledge, threatened, against Parent or Merger Sub challenging or seeking to
prohibit the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of
the Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Financing._ Parent currently has cash on hand and available
lines of credit or other committed financing (evidence of which has previously
been provided to the Company (the " _Available Credit Sources_ ")), and Parent
and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date, sufficient funds (i) to acquire
all of the Merger Shares in accordance with the terms of the Merger, (ii) to
pay all cash amounts to be paid with respect to the Company's outstanding
equity compensation awards pursuant to Section 3.3 and (iii) to pay all fees
and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. Each
Available Credit Source is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub and the other parties
thereto, as the case may be. No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or, to the
knowledge of officers of Parent any other party thereto. Neither Parent or
Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any Available Credit Source will not
be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is owned directly by Parent. Merger Sub has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and, as of the
Effective Time, will not have engaged in any activities other than in
connection with the Transactions. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists of 1,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
which 100 shares are issued and outstanding.

 



 

Section 5.7 _No Brokers_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has entered into
any contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person or firm which may
result in the payment of any finder's fees, brokerage or other like payments
in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, except that Parent has retained GCA Savvian
Advisors, LLC as its financial advisor.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into
the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Assuming (i) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the
Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Company contained herein (for such purposes, such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material
respects without giving effect to any knowledge, materiality or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception) and compliance in all
material respects by the Company with the covenants contained herein and (iii)
any estimate, projection or forecast of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
have been provided by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub prior to the date
hereof have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were
reasonable at the date hereof, and after giving effect to the Transactions,
including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.3, any other repayment or refinancing of
debt contemplated by this Agreement, payment of all amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and payment of
all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of
the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on
its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged as of such date or as proposed to be engaged and (c) such
Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature or become due. For purposes
of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature or become due" means that such Person will be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), (i)
pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
in respect of any Share consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Per Share Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any shareholder of the
Company has agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement or has agreed to vote
against any Superior Proposal or (ii) pursuant to which any shareholder of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make an investment in, or
contribution to, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Stock Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns any
shares of capital stock of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Certain Agreements_. There are no agreements, arrangements
or understandings (in each case, whether oral or written) between Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the
Company's management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof
that relate in any way to, or are in connection with, the Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Proxy Statement_. The information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at the time the
Proxy Statement (or any amendments or supplements thereto) is first mailed to
shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 



 

Section 5.13 _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
and any certificate or document delivered in connection with this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including with
respect to any information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the Transactions.

Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later than 20
business days thereafter), the Company shall, in consultation with Parent,
prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after
receipt thereof and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after comments are received from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) thereon and after the furnishing by the Company and
Parent of all information required to be contained therein, the Company shall,
in consultation with Parent, prepare and file any required amendments to the
Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and
Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall consult with Parent regarding, and provide Parent with
copies of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response and the Company shall in good faith
consider including all such comments proposed by Parent. If at any time prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information promptly
shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Laws,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. The Company shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement mail to
the shareholders of the Company the Proxy Statement and all other proxy
materials for the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company and Parent shall
make any necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the Transactions
under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Company Shareholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through
the Company Board (or a committee thereof), shall (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable following confirmation by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) that
it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement take all action necessary to
set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") and (ii) subject to Section
6.4, include in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. The
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of
the Company as of the record date established for the Company Shareholders
Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement. Unless the Agreement has been duly terminated in accordance
with the terms herein, the Company shall, subject to the right of the Company
Board to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent under the
circumstances specified in Section 6.4(d), use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from the shareholders of the Company proxies in favor of the proposal
to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the Transactions and to
secure the Company Shareholder Approval (it being understood that the
foregoing shall not require the Company Board to recommend in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, if a Change of Recommendation has been effected in
accordance with Section 6.4(d)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, if the Company
believes in good faith that it is necessary to ensure that any legally
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is timely provided to
the shareholders of the Company or (ii) with the consent of Parent, if as of
the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of the
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders
Meeting.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.4 _Acquisition Proposals._

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives not to, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 8, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries
regarding, or the making of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-
public information or data to, any Person relating to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
contacting and engaging in discussions with such Person for the sole purpose
of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and informing such Person of the
existence of this Section 6.4), (iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate
(including by providing information) any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of
the foregoing. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Representatives_ "
shall mean the directors, officers, employees, affiliates, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives of any Person.
Upon execution of this Agreement, the standstill provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, and the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (to the extent provided by the applicable confidentiality agreement),
and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

 



 

(b) At any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if
the Company receives a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any Person
or group of Persons and the Company has complied with its obligations under
this Section 6.4, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 6.4(a), (A) the Company and its Representatives may provide
information, including non-public information (which may be by posting to the
"virtual data room" available to Parent and its Representatives) in response
to a request therefor by such Person or group of Persons if such Person or
group of Persons has executed and delivered to the Company a confidentiality
agreement containing provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood,
however, that the confidentiality agreement (x) need not prohibit, condition
or restrict the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal and (y) shall
not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with
such party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its
obligations hereunder) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
_provided_ that any material non-public information that the Company made
available to such Person or group of Persons has previously been made
available to Parent or is promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after the
time it is provided to such Person or group of Persons) made available to
Parent, and (B) the Company and its Representatives may engage or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of Persons
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if and only if prior to taking any action
described in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel, that (x) failure to take such action would reasonably likely be
a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws and (y) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer by a Third Party with
respect to (i) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction or series of transactions which would result in the
acquisition by a Third Party of more than 20% of the total voting power of the
capital stock or more than 20% of the consolidated assets (based on the fair
market value thereof as determined by the Company Board in good faith) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) a transaction or a series of transactions
that, if consummated, would result, directly or indirectly, in the acquisition
by a Third Party of more than 20% of the total voting power of the capital
stock or more than 20% of the consolidated assets (based on the fair market
value thereof, as determined by the Company Board in good faith) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Transactions.

 



 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal which would
result in the acquisition by a Third Party of more than 50% of the total
voting power of the capital stock or more than 50% of the consolidated assets
(based on the fair market value thereof as determined by the Company Board in
good faith) of the Company and its Subsidiaries that the Company Board or any
appropriate committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and
considering such factors as the Company Board or any appropriate committee
thereof consider appropriate (i) is reasonably capable of being consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory,
financial, financing and timing and other aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, and (ii) if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Company's shareholders from a financial
point of view than the Transactions (after having complied with, and giving
effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and Merger Sub
in response to such proposal or otherwise pursuant to, Section 6.4(d)).

 



 

" _Third Party_ " means any Person or group other than (i) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (ii) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(d), neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall:

 



 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose to authorize,
adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable), any Acquisition
Proposal (each action described in this clause (i), a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ");

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter
into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive
agreement or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in
principle with respect thereto, in each case together with any ancillary
agreements (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal;
or

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a).

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a
Change of Recommendation (and, solely in connection with accepting a Superior
Proposal as contemplated thereby, take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) of
this Agreement), if the Company has complied with its obligations under this
Section 6.4 and the Company Board has received a written bona fide Acquisition
Proposal from any Person or group of Persons that is not withdrawn and that
the Company Board believes in good faith after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and outside legal counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal,
but only if prior to effecting the Change of Recommendation or taking action
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to do so would
reasonably likely be a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be entitled to effect any Change of
Recommendation or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement
unless:

 



 

(x) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Notice of
Proposed Change of Recommendation_ ") to Parent and Merger Sub of its
intention to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or to take action pursuant
to Section 8.3(a) and such notice shall specify if the proposed Change of
Recommendation is in respect of a Superior Proposal, the basis for such Change
of Recommendation, including, the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (unless such Superior
Proposal is in written form, in which case the Company shall provide Parent
copies of all written requests, proposals or offers and the proposed
transaction agreements and any financing commitments comprising or relating
thereto);

 



 

(y) if any changes to this Agreement shall have been offered in writing by
Parent during the three business day-period following Parent's and Merger
Sub's receipt of the Notice of Proposed Change of Recommendation in a manner
that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, the Company
Board or such committee shall have considered such changes in good faith and
shall have determined, if the intended Change of Recommendation is the result
of a Superior Proposal, that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes were to be given effect;
and

 



 

(z) the Superior Proposal did not result from a material breach by the
Company of its obligations under this Section 6.4;

 



 

 _provided that_ , if the intended Change of Recommendation is the result of a
Superior Proposal, in the event of any material amendment to the financial
terms or any other material revisions to such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Proposed Change of Recommendation
to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.4(d) with respect to such new Notice of Proposed Change of Recommendation,
except that the reference to the three business day-period above shall be
deemed to be a reference to a two business day-period. During the three
business day period prior to its effecting an Change of Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement as provided above, the Company shall, and shall
cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law, including taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to shareholders), or (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
shareholders of the Company); _provided_ that any Change of Recommendation may
be made only in accordance with Section 6.4(d).

 



 

 



   



 

(f) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 6.4, from and after the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees
that it will promptly (and, in any event, within one business day) (i) notify
Parent if the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information or other inquiry that the Company believes is reasonably likely to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) in connection with such notice,
provide to Parent the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal or request or inquiry and a summary of the material terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or request or other inquiry
(unless such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry is in written form, in which case
the Company shall provide Parent copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers and the proposed transaction agreements and financing commitments
comprising or relating thereto). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event, within one business day), of
any material change to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or request or
inquiry (including any amendments thereto).

Parent and its Affiliates shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries

respective required filings under the HSR Act and any applicable non-U.S.

Antitrust Laws_ ") (and Parent shall pay all filing fees incident to all such
filings by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and their
respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to
(A) submit all filings required under the HSR Act not more than 20 business

shall promptly make any other required submissions under the HSR Act or in the
jurisdictions identified in Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter;

 



 

(ii) as soon as practicable, prepare and file with CFIUS a draft joint
voluntary notice pursuant to FINSA with respect to the Transactions and
promptly provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental information

period, at the end of which the Company and Parent will prepare and file with
CFIUS a final joint voluntary notice pursuant to FINSA with respect to the
Transactions;

 



 

(iii) promptly notify each other of any substantive communication
concerning this Agreement or the Transactions to that party or any of its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority and, to the extent not prohibited
by Applicable Laws or such Governmental Authority, permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions to any Governmental Authority and provide a reasonable
opportunity for the other party to provide comments and for any such
reasonable comments to be accounted for prior to their submission;

 



 

(iv) not participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless it consults with
the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws or
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or discussion;

 



 

 



   



 

(v) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its Affiliates and representatives on the one hand, and any government or
regulatory authority or members of any such authority's staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, except any
confidential information or business secrets, which information shall be
provided to counsel on a counsel-to-counsel basis;

 



 

(vi) furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in
connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or
submissions of information to any Governmental Authorities, including the
Proxy Statement and any filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions
of the HSR Act and applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws;

 



 

(vii) subject to Section 6.5(c), "substantially comply" and certify
substantial compliance with any request for additional information (also known
as a "second request") issued pursuant to the HSR Act as soon as reasonably
practicable following the issuance of the request for additional information;
and

 



 

(viii) use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article 7 are satisfied
and to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings.

 



 

(b) Without limiting Section 6.5(a), the Company, Parent and Parent's
Affiliates shall each use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
reasonable best efforts promptly to:

 



 

(i) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act and to obtain required clearances and approvals under
applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable;

 



 

(ii) avoid the entry of any decree, order or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing;

 



 

(iii) take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary
decree, order or judgment is entered, issued or enacted, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any proceeding, review or
inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would materially restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof,
the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii)
of this Section 6.5(b)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend,
prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
decree, order or judgment so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as
close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) take any and all steps necessary to obtain any consents or eliminate
any impediments to the Merger.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and subject
to the last sentence of this Section 6.5(c), the obligations of Parent under
this Section 6.5 shall include Parent committing to, as a condition to and in
return for obtaining any and all expirations of waiting periods under the HSR
Act or consents from any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
Transactions under the Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws in the jurisdictions identified
in Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, any of the following: (i)
agreeing to sell, divest or otherwise convey any particular asset, category,
portion or part of an asset or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Effective Time; (ii) agreeing to
permit the Company to sell, divest or otherwise convey any of the particular
assets, categories, portions or parts of assets or business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) licensing,
holding separate or entering into similar arrangements with respect to the
assets of the Company or conduct of business arrangements or terminating any
and all joint venture, strategic partnership and other similar agreements, in
each case, to the extent such action is necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate
or remove the issuance or enactment of any order, decree, decision,
determination, judgment or law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of Transactions by any Governmental Authority.
No actions taken pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.5(c)
shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not agree with a Governmental Authority without the prior
written consent of Parent, to divest or hold separate, or enter into any
licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible
or intangible) or any portion of the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, if such divestiture or hold separate involves assets that are
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or if
such licensing or similar arrangement would materially adversely affect assets
that are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.5(c) with respect to its business or
operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned
upon the Closing.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its
Affiliates to sell, divest or otherwise convey any of their respective assets,
categories, portions or parts of assets or businesses (other than assets or
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent provided in
Section 6.5(c)) at any time or to license, hold separate or enter into similar
arrangements with respect to their respective assets or conduct of business
arrangements or to terminate any of their respective existing relationships or
contractual rights or obligations as a condition to obtaining any expiration
of waiting periods under the HSR Act or consents from Governmental Authorities
necessary to consummate the Transactions under any Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Access and Reports._

 



 

(a) Subject to Applicable Laws then in effect and applicable contractual
restrictions in effect on the date hereof, upon reasonable notice, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers and other
authorized Representatives of Parent, reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its and
its Subsidiaries' officers and its and its Subsidiaries' properties, offices
and other facilities and its and its Subsidiaries' books, contracts, personnel
files and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly all information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested by Parent and its Representatives from time to time; _provided_ that
any such access shall be coordinated through one of the persons listed on
Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter and _provided further_ that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company herein; and _provided,
further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) (A) to permit
any inspection that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would be
materially disruptive to the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or (B) to disclose any information that would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality, (ii) to disclose any information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, be
prohibited by Applicable Laws or waive the protection of attorney-client, work
product or other legal privilege, (iii) to provide access to or otherwise make
available any information relating to the process conducted by the Company
that led to the execution of this Agreement or (iv) to provide access to or
otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the extent that
the provision of such information could in the judgment of the Company based
on advice of counsel violate Applicable Law. The parties will use reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances
in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, unless with the express, prior written consent of the Company and
under such conditions as the Company may reasonably require, neither Parent
nor any of its Representatives shall have the right to conduct any surface or
subsurface soil or surface or ground water sampling, monitoring, borings or
testing on any properties owned or leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives, not to use any information provided pursuant to this Section
6.6(a) for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the Transactions. The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to
information furnished by the Company hereunder.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any action, suit, claim, investigation or
proceeding commenced or, to such party's knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the Transactions, and (iii) if such party becomes aware of any facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition set
forth in Article 7 not to be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6(b) shall not cure any
breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Publicity_. Unless and until a Change of Recommendation has
occurred in connection with Section 6.4(d), the Company and Parent each shall
consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements (other than routine employee communications) with
respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Authority (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect

pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Authority.

and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article 3. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence or as otherwise provided in Section 8.6, whether or not the

Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except that Parent shall pay or reimburse the Company for Parent's
payment obligations pursuant to Section 6.5(a)(i).

 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance._

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Laws (and shall also pay or advance expenses as incurred, to
the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Laws, to), each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts that are paid in settlement incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Party's service as a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time or services performed by such
Indemnified Party, at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as a
fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or as a director or officer of
another Person at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, but not limited to, in
connection with (i) the Transactions and (ii) actions to enforce this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party in effect on the date hereof. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate in or use reasonable best efforts in the vigorous defense
of any such matter; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
respective prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and
disbursements, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.10.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), if any Indemnified
Party becomes involved in any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation covered by this Section 6.10 after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, advance to such Indemnified Party his or her
legal or other expenses (including attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements
and the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection
therewith) within ten business days of receipt by Parent and the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor, subject to such
Indemnified Party providing Parent and the Surviving Corporation with an
undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a non-
appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled thereto, but without any requirement for the
posting of a bond or any other terms or conditions other than those expressly
set forth herein.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancelable extension of
(i) the directors', officers' and employees' liability coverage of the
Company's existing directors', officers' and employees' insurance policies,
and (ii) the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect
to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Company's existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions);
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company or the Surviving
Corporation expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ ") (which annual amount
the Company represents and warrants is set forth on Section 6.10(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance from financially sound and reputable
carriers for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties
as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of the Maximum Premium; and _provided,
further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the
Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.10.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) expressly intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her legal representatives and (ii) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The provisions of this
Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(f) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection
with the Transactions) now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in
any agreement in effect on the date hereof (and made available to Parent prior
to the date hereof) between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any current or former director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, will be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation without further action, as of the Effective Time, and will survive
the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. The Charter and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are
presently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company By-Laws, which
provisions shall not be amended or otherwise modified for a period of six
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such director or officer, unless such modification is required by
Applicable Laws during such period.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the case of
Sections 6.10(c) and 6.10(f) in the event that any claim for indemnification
is asserted or made on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue
until the final disposition of such claim.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice of material breach, material default, termination, expiration or
other event with respect to any Available Credit Source which would be
reasonably likely to cause Parent or Merger Sub to be unable to obtain the
funds necessary to satisfy their respective obligations under this Agreement.
After the date hereof, if Parent and Merger Sub shall not have cash on hand
and Available Credit Sources to provide sufficient funds on the Closing Date
(i) to acquire all of the Merger Shares in accordance with the terms of the
Merger, (ii) to pay all cash amounts to be paid with respect to the Company's
outstanding equity compensation awards pursuant to Section 3.3 and (iii) to
pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement, then Parent shall give the Company prompt notice thereof and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as
practicable alternative financing from alternative sources in such amounts as
shall be required to provide sufficient funds. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of sufficient funds is not a
condition to the Closing.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Employee Matters._

 



 

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the 12-month anniversary of the Effective Time,
provide to (x) each non-union represented employee who is employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any such employee who is not
actively at work on account of illness, disability or leave of absence)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Affected Non-Union
Employee_ ") a base salary and target bonus opportunity under annual cash
incentive plans that are no less favorable than the base salary and target
bonus opportunity provided to such Affected Non-Union Employee by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) Affected
Non-Union Employees, in the aggregate, employee benefits (excluding equity and
equity-based awards, executive welfare benefits, perquisites and quarterly
discretionary contribution payments) that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those provided to Affected Non-Union Employees by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to
union-represented employees of the Company and each of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries (" _Affected Union Employees_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall
comply with the terms and conditions of all applicable collective bargaining
agreements as in effect as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
to assume and honor, in accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit Plan
disclosed in Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to any
employment agreements existing on the date of this Agreement, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Affected Non-
Union Employees whose employment terminates during the 12-month period
following the Effective Time, severance benefits, if any, at the levels and
pursuant to the terms of the Company's severance program and guidelines as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and disclosed in Section
4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) during such 12-month period
following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered to Affected Non-Union
Employees shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after
the Effective Time in compensation paid to Affected Non-Union Employees.
Nothing contained in this Section 6.12 shall (x) be deemed to grant any
Affected Non-Union Employee or Affected Union Employee (together, " _Affected
Employees_ ") the right to continued employment after the Effective Time or
affect the right of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to terminate
the employment of the Affected Employees for any reason, subject to Applicable
Law and the terms and conditions of any applicable collective bargaining
agreements or (y) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit
Plans in accordance with their respective terms.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation will cause any benefit plans of the
Surviving Corporation in which the Affected Employees are entitled to
participate after the Effective Time to take into account for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for purposes of accrual of
benefits), service by the Affected Employees for the Company and its
Subsidiaries as if such service were with the Surviving Corporation, to the
same extent such service was credited under a comparable Company Benefit Plan
(except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits).

 



 

(c) To the extent permitted under Applicable Laws and except to the extent
it would result in a duplication of benefits, with respect to any employee
benefit plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Affected Employees, the Surviving
Corporation will (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the same
extent waived under comparable Company Benefit Plans and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to amounts paid by such Affected Employees during the calendar
year in which Effective Time occurs under similar Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and
discharge the Company's and its Subsidiaries' obligations under all Company
Benefit Plans accrued as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledges that a
"corporate change," "change in control" or "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of each Company Benefit Plan disclosed in Section
6.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter will occur at the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.12 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Affected Employee), other than the parties hereto and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this
Section 6.12) under or by reason of this Agreement nor shall any provision of
this Section 6.12 constitute an amendment or modification of any of the
Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Shareholder Litigation_. Subject to a customary joint
defense agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company or its directors or officers arising after the
date hereof as a result of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation_.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.15 _No Control of Other Party 's Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent's or
its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.16 _Existing Credit Agreement Matters_. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent, at least three business days
prior to the Effective Time, fully executed copies of payoff letters, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent (including the total payoff
amount required to fully satisfy all outstanding obligations thereunder and
any daily accrual thereafter), for the Company's existing credit facilities
which payoff letters shall provide that upon receipt of the applicable payoff
amount there shall occur the release of all guarantees, Liens and other
security over the Company's and its Subsidiaries' properties and assets
securing its obligations under such existing credit facilities, together with
the return of any collateral in the possession of the relevant lender,
administrative agent or collateral agent, at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

being satisfied.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Effect of Termination._

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article
8, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any
Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); _provided, however_ , and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, that (i) except as otherwise provided
herein and subject to Section 8.5(e) (including the limitation on liability
set forth therein), no such termination shall relieve any party from any
liability to pay the fees, expenses and other amounts set forth in this
Section 8.5 or Section 8.6 if and when due pursuant to the provisions thereof,
(ii) subject to Section 8.5(e) (including the limitation on liability set
forth therein), no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for
any willful, knowing or intentional breach by such party, (iii) no such
termination shall relieve Parent from any payment or reimbursement obligation
under Section 6.5(a)(i) or 8.5(d) and (iv) the provisions set forth in
Sections 6.9 and 8.5 and Article 9, and the Confidentiality Agreement (to the
extent provided therein) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.4(b) (or pursuant to Section 8.2(a) at a time when
this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or 8.4(b)),
(y) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made (and, in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or pursuant to Section 8.2(a) at a time
when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b), such
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly available) after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the date of the event giving rise to such right of
termination and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly
withdrawn prior to (1) the date of the event giving rise to such right of
termination (in connection with a termination pursuant to Section 8.4(b) or
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) at a time when this Agreement was terminable by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b)) or (2) the Company Shareholders Meeting (in
connection with a termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) at a time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.2(b)), and (z) prior to or within 24 months after such
termination, the Company enters into any definitive agreement with respect to,
or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of
this clause (b), the references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a); or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.3(a);

 



 

then the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than (A) in the case of
clause (i) above, three business days after the date on which the Company
consummates the Acquisition Proposal or after the date on which the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect thereto, (B) in the case of
clause (ii) above, three business days after the date of such termination and
(C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination) pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its
designees the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion). " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean
an amount equal to $23 million (less any Parent Expenses previously paid by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.6). Any Termination Fee paid to Parent or
its designees pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent to the Company for such purpose.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c), then Parent shall promptly, but in no
event later than three business days after the date of such termination, pay
or cause to be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds an
amount equal to $23 million (the " _Parent Fee_ ") (it being understood that
in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Fee on more than one
occasion). It is agreed that the Parent Fee is liquidated damages and not a
penalty, and the payment of the Parent Fee in the circumstances specified
herein is supported by due and sufficient consideration.

 



 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.5 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5(b)
or Section 8.6, or if Parent fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to
Section 8.5(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on
the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results
in a judgment against the Company for any amounts due pursuant to Section
8.5(b) or Section 8.6, or a judgment against Parent or Merger Sub for any
amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), the Company shall pay to Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other
hand, its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion
thereof at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 9.12: (i) the Company's right to terminate this Agreement
and to receive the Parent Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall, upon full
payment to the Company of the Parent Fee, be the sole and exclusive remedies

current or future shareholder, controlling Person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, affiliated
(or commonly advised) funds, representative, agent and assignee and successor
of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Related Party_ ") for any losses or
damages suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith or the failure
of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith, in each case, in any
circumstance in which the Company is permitted to terminate this Agreement and
receive the Parent Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and upon payment of such
amounts if and when due, none of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions (except that Parent shall remain
obligated with respect to the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of
Parent contained in Sections 6.5(a)(i) and 8.5(d)) or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity
or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise; and (ii) in connection with any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or
in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith, in each case, other than in a circumstance in which the
Company is permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent Fee
pursuant to Section 8.5(c), the Company agrees that the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent and Merger Sub to the Company shall be limited to an
amount equal to the amount of the Parent Fee, and in no event shall the
Company seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, under no
circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages the aggregate
amount of which, together with any portion of the Parent Fee paid to the
Company by Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(c), exceeds the amount of the Parent
Fee (plus any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5(d)), and in no event
shall the Company seek to recover monetary damages from any Related Party
(other than Parent and Merger Sub). Parent's right to terminate this Agreement
and to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b) shall, upon full
payment to Parent of the Termination Fee, be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Affiliates against the Company and
any of its respective former, current, or future shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives or agents for any losses or
damages suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith or the failure
of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith, in each case, in any
circumstance in which Parent is permitted to terminate this Agreement and
receive the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b), and upon payment of
such amounts if and when due, none of the Company or any of its respective
former, current, or future shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents or representatives shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions
(except for any reimbursement and expense obligations of the Company pursuant
to Section 8.5(d) and Section 8.6) or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity or in respect of oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and, in such case, the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty
(and the payment of the Termination Fee in the circumstances specified herein
is supported by due and sufficient consideration) for any and all losses and
damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and each of their
Affiliates and any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Merger and the Transactions (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination and
none of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
the Company or any Affiliate of the Company arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the Transactions (or the abandonment
or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis of such termination.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8.6 _Parent Expenses_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in the event of termination of this Agreement by (i) either

a different provision of Section 8.2 at a time when this Agreement was
terminable pursuant to Section 8.2(b)) or (ii) Parent pursuant to Section
8.4(b), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than three
business days after receipt of an invoice (with supporting documentation)
therefor from Parent, pay Parent's designee all of the reasonably documented
out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties,
experts and consultants) actually and reasonably incurred by Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions up to a maximum amount of $2.5 million (the " _Parent Expenses_
"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds; _provided, however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company have any obligation to make any such
payment if, at the time of such termination, this Agreement was terminable by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b).

 



 

Section 8.7 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to Section 9.5, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, each party may, to the extent legally allowed,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made by any other party hereto contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of any other party hereto

Section 9.10 _Waivers_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf
of any party, or delay or omission in the exercise of any right, power or
remedy accruing to any party as a result of any breach or default hereunder by
any other party shall be deemed to impair any such right power or remedy, nor
will it be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement, to the extent possible, in such a manner as to
be valid, legal and enforceable but so as to retain most nearly the intent of
the parties as expressed herein, and if such a modification is not possible,
that provision will be severed from this Agreement, and all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not
affected in any manner adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties hereto intend that the provisions of Article 8 and Section 9.12,
including the remedies and limitations thereon (including Section 8.5(e)) be
construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such provisions,
remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that diminishes
a party's rights hereunder or increases a party's liability or obligations
hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Enforcement of Agreement._

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that any of the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate the Merger and the Transactions) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and hereby agree that, unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with Article 8, in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not raise any objection to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided herein, including objections on the basis that
(x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or equity or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Until such time as Parent pays
the Parent Fee, the remedies available to the Company pursuant to this Section
9.12 shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law
or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance
shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the
alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Parent Fee
pursuant to Section 8.5. The parties hereto further agree that nothing set
forth in this Section 9.12 shall require any party hereto to institute any
proceeding for specific performance under this Section 9.12 prior to or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article 8 (and/or receipt
of any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5), nor shall the commencement of any
legal action or legal proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.12 or anything set
forth in this Section 9.12 restrict or limit any party's right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 8. For the avoidance of
doubt, under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages
the aggregate amount of which, together with any portion of the Parent Fee
paid to the Company by Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(c), exceeds the amount
of the Parent Fee (plus any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5(d)).

 



 

Section 9.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of
Missouri located in St. Louis County, Missouri, or the Federal court of the
United States of America located in the Eastern District of Missouri, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
Missouri state court or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such
Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Missouri state or
Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Missouri state or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
