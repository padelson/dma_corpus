 _EXECUTION VERSION_  

   

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of December 12, 2010, by and among: Dell International L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"); Dell Trinity Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and Compellent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A. 

  

Recitals 

   

 A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 B. The respective boards of directors of Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger, and this Agreement and the Merger have been approved on behalf of Parent. 

  

 C. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger to be consummated, certain stockholders of the Company are executing voting and support agreements in favor of Parent concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Support Agreements"). 

  

Agreement 

   

 The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

Section 1\. Description of Transaction 

   

 1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

  

 1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP, 1950 University Avenue, Suite 500, East Palo Alto, California, at 8:00 a.m. (California time) on the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 6.4 and 7.4, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions) unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company in connection with the Closing and, concurrently with or immediately following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be specified in such certificate of merger with the consent of Parent (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Effective Time"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. 

  

 (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety pursuant to the Merger at the Effective Time or immediately thereafter to conform to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Compellent Technologies, Inc." 

   

 (b) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time or immediately thereafter to conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 1.5 Conversion of Shares. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: 

    

 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be so held and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof; 

   

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof; 

   

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this Section 1.5(a) and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.7 and 1.8, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive $27.75 in cash, without interest; and 

   

 (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the consideration to be delivered in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. 

   

 1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books
after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate
previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") is
presented to the Paying Agent (as defined in Section 1.7(a)) or to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7. 

   

 1.7 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select and enter into an agreement with a reputable bank or trust company that will act as paying agent in the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payments of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5 (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Payment Agent as directed by Parent. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and as are reasonably acceptable to the Company (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and that risk of loss of, and title to, Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly representing such shares is registered if (1) any such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (2) such holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide a reasonably appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such reasonable sum as Parent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.7. 

   

 (c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date that is one year after the date on which the Merger becomes 

    ##### 

  

    

effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company
Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look
only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or any Company Equity Award such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and are remitted to the applicable Taxing Authorities on a timely basis, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 (e) If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; or (ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such Company Stock Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. 

   

 (g) The Surviving Corporation or Parent shall bear and pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent incurred in connection with the payment of Merger Consideration. 

   

 1.8 Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights specified in Section 262 of the DGCL). 

  

 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed automatically to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only, the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares. 

  

 (c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument
unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such payment
or settlement offer. 

   

 1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action. 

 

Section 2\. Representations and Warranties of the Company 

   

 Except (i) as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent on the date of this Agreement or (ii) as set forth in reasonable detail in the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (specifically excluding any forward-looking or predictive statements or disclosures set forth, and any statements or disclosures set forth under the caption "Risk Factors" contained, in such Company SEC Reports), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 2.1 Organization; Good Standing. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly licensed and qualified to do business and is in good standing (or equivalent status) in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing (or equivalent status) would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to date, of the Company. The Company is not in material violation of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws. 

  

 2.2 Power; Enforceability.

 (e) Promptly (but no later than three days) after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall adopt a stockholder rights plan in the form previously approved by Parent (and otherwise satisfactory in form and substance to Parent). The Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, amend or waive any provision of such rights plan or redeem any of the rights issued under such rights plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the board of directors of the Company may amend or waive any provision of such rights plan or redeem such rights if: (i) (A) neither any Acquired Corporation nor any Representative of any Acquired Corporation shall have breached or taken any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in Section 4.3, in Section 5.2 or in the Confidentiality Agreement, (B) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having consulted with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to amend such rights plan, waive such provision or redeem such rights would constitute a breach by the Companys board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law, and (C) the Company provides Parent with written notice of the Companys intent to take such action at least four business days before taking such action; or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take such action or issues an injunction mandating such action.

Inquiry) (i) advise Parent in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or

submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the material
terms and conditions thereof) and (ii) provide Parent with copies of
all documents and written communications (and written summaries of all oral
communications) received by any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of

or proposed modification thereto, and shall promptly (and in no event later

or communication) provide Parent with a copy of any correspondence or written
communication (and a written summary of any oral communication) between (A)
any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation
and (B) the Person that made or submitted such Acquisition Proposal or

 (d) The Company shall, and shall ensure that the other Acquired Corporations and each Person that is a Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. 

  

 (e) The Company (i) agrees that it will not, and shall ensure that each other Acquired Corporation will not, release or permit the release of any Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no-hire, "standstill" or similar agreement or provision to which any of the Acquired Corporations is or becomes a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has or acquires any rights (including the "standstill" provision contained in any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company pursuant to clause "(iv)(B)" of Section 4.3(b)), and (ii) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement or provision at the request of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may release a Person from, or amend or waive any provision of, any such "standstill" agreement or provision if (1) neither any Acquired Corporation nor any Representative of any Acquired Corporation shall have breached or taken any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in Section 4.3, in Section 5.2 or in the Confidentiality Agreement, (2) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having consulted with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to release such Person from such agreement or provision, the failure to amend such agreement or the failure to waive such provision would constitute a breach by the Companys board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law, and (3) the Company provides Parent with written notice of the Companys intent to take such action at least four business days before taking such action. 

  

 (f) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall request each Person that has executed a confidentiality or similar agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal or investment in any Acquired Corporation to return or destroy all confidential information previously furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations.

Section 5\. Additional Covenants of the Parties 

   

 5.1 Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable, with the timely cooperation and assistance of Parent, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company shall consult with Parent and provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto (and to review and comment on any comments of the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto), and shall reasonably consider all comments made by Parent, prior to the filing thereof.

If any event relating to any of the Acquired Corporations occurs, or if the Company becomes aware of any information, that causes any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement to have become false or misleading in any material respect, then the Company shall promptly inform Parent thereof and shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, mail such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. If any event relating to Parent or Merger Sub occurs, or if Parent becomes aware of any information, that causes any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement to have become false or misleading in any material respect, then Parent shall promptly inform the Company thereof and the Company shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, mail such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. 

  

 5.2 Company Stockholders Meeting. 

  

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company and Parent) as promptly as practicable after the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

(The unanimous determination that the Merger is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and the unanimous recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement are collectively referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation.") The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Proxy Statement includes the opinions of the financial advisors referred to in Section 2.29. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall: (i) except as provided in Section 5.2(d), withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Company Board Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed to have been modified by the board of directors of the Company in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub if the Company Board Recommendation shall no longer be unanimous (except for any vote that is not unanimous solely because a director is not present for the vote due to incapacity or because he is not reasonably available to attend a meeting), including as a result of actions of individual members of the board of directors of the Company indicating that the board of directors of the Company does not unanimously support the Merger or does not unanimously believe that the Merger is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders); (ii) recommend the approval, acceptance or adoption of, or approve, endorse, accept or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve or recommend, or cause or permit any Acquired Corporation to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar document or Contract constituting or relating directly or indirectly to, or that contemplates or is intended or could reasonably be expected to result directly or indirectly in, an Acquisition Transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in clause "(iv)(B)" of Section 4.3(b); or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or permit any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation to agree or publicly propose to, take any of the actions referred to in this Section 5.2(c). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause "(i)" of Section 5.2(c), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the Company may withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, refuse to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, refuse to publicly state that the Merger and this Agreement are in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, refuse to issue a press release announcing its opposition to an Acquisition Proposal or recommend a Superior Proposal (each of the foregoing being referred to as a "Recommendation Change"), but only: 

   

 (i) if: (A) an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result directly or indirectly from a breach of or any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in Section 4.3, in Section 5.2 or in the Confidentiality Agreement or from a breach of any "standstill" or similar agreement or provision under which any Acquired Corporation has or had any rights; (C) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having consulted with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer; (D) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having consulted with the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure to make a Recommendation Change would constitute a breach by the Companys board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (E) at least four business days prior to making a Recommendation Change pursuant to this clause "(i)," the Companys board of directors delivers to Parent a written notice (a "Recommendation Change Notice") (1) stating that the Company has received a Superior Offer that did not result directly or indirectly from a breach of or any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in Section 4.3, in Section 5.2 or in the Confidentiality Agreement or from a breach of any "standstill" or similar agreement or provision under which any Acquired Corporation has any rights, (2) stating the Companys board of directors intention to make a Recommendation Change as a result of such Superior Offer and describing the nature of such intended Recommendation Change, (3) specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Offer, including the identity of the Person making such Superior Offer, and (4) attaching copies 

   ##### 

  

   

of the most current and complete draft of any Contract relating to such
Superior Offer and all other documents and written communications (and
written summaries of all oral communications) relating to such Superior
Offer; (F) throughout the period between the delivery of such Recommendation
Change Notice and any Recommendation Change, the Company engages (to the
extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend this Agreement; and (G) at the time of the Recommendation Change, a
failure to make such Recommendation Change would constitute a breach by the
Companys board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Delaware law in light of such Superior Offer
(after taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by
clause "(F)" above or otherwise); or 

   

 (ii) if: (A) there shall arise after the date of this Agreement any change in circumstances affecting the Acquired Corporations that does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal and that leads the Companys board of directors to consider making a Recommendation Change (any such change in circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to as a "Change in Circumstances"); (B) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having consulted with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, the failure to make a Recommendation Change would constitute a breach by the Companys board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (C) no less than four business days prior making a Recommendation Change pursuant to this clause "(ii)," the Companys board of directors delivers to Parent a written notice (1) stating that a Change in Circumstances has arisen, (2) stating that it intends to make a Recommendation Change in light of such Change in Circumstances and describing the nature of such intended Recommendation Change, and (3) containing a reasonably detailed description of such Change in Circumstances; (D) throughout the period between the delivery of such notice and such Recommendation Change, the Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement; and (E) at the time of such Recommendation Change, the failure to make such Recommendation Change would constitute a breach by the Companys board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law in light of such Change in Circumstances (after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(D)" above or otherwise). 

 

For purposes of clause "(i)" of the first sentence of this Section 5.2(d), any
change in the form or amount of the consideration payable in connection with
a Superior Offer, and any other material change to any of the terms of a
Superior Offer, will be deemed to be a new Superior Offer (or
other Acquisition Proposal), requiring a new Recommendation Change Notice and
a new advance notice period; _provided, however_ , that the advance notice
period applicable to any such change to a Superior Offer pursuant to clause
"(i)(E)" of the first sentence of this Section 5.2(d) shall be three business
days rather than four business days. The Company agrees to keep confidential,
and not to disclose to the public or to any Person, any and all information
regarding any negotiations that take place pursuant to clause "(i)(F)" or
clause "(ii)(D)" of the first sentence of this Section 5.2(d) (including the
existence and terms of any proposal made on behalf of Parent or the Company
during such negotiations), except to the extent such disclosure is required by
applicable law or the rules and regulations of any applicable U.S.
Governmental Body to which the Company is subject or submits. The Company
shall ensure that any Recommendation Change: (x) does not change or otherwise
affect the approval of this Agreement or the Support Agreements by the
Companys board of directors or any other approval of the Companys board of
directors; and (y) does not have the effect of causing any corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute (including any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or "fair price" statute) of the State
of 

      ##### 

  

    

Delaware or any other state to be applicable to this Agreement, any of the
Support Agreements, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions. 

   

 (e) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Circumstances or by any Recommendation Change. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that (i) unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall not submit any Acquisition Proposal to a vote of its stockholders and (ii) the Company shall not (without Parents prior written consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Company Stockholders Meeting, except to the extent required to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. 

  

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the taking or disclosing of such position may constitute a Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 5.3 Stock Options and ESPP. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Option granted under the Companys 2002 Stock Option Plan that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to become vested in full as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (contingent upon the consummation of the Merger). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Option that is vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all Options that vest contingent upon the consummation of the Merger) (each, an "Outstanding Vested Company Option") to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof the holder of each such Outstanding Vested Company Option shall be granted the right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Vested Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to: (i) $27.75; _minus_ (ii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (it being understood that, if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to any such Company Option equals or exceeds $27.75, then the amount payable under this Section 5.3(a) with respect to such Company Option shall be zero). Each holder of an Outstanding Vested Company Option cancelled as provided in this Section 5.3(a) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration (if any) specified in this Section 5.3(a), without interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this Section 5.3(a) to be paid promptly following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company Options that will vest contingent upon the consummation of the Merger (each, an "Outstanding Unvested Company Option"), shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Dell Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Dell Inc.: (i) assuming such Outstanding Unvested Company Option; or (ii) replacing such Outstanding Unvested Company Option by issuing an equivalent replacement stock option to purchase Dell Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan, and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Outstanding Unvested Company Option is evidenced and in a manner that is in compliance with the requirements of Code Sections 409A and 422 such that each such assumed or replaced Company Option is exempt from Code Section 409A and maintains its status as an "incentive stock option" to the extent permitted by the Code. All Outstanding Unvested Company Options shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

assumed or replaced by Dell Inc. and all rights thereunder shall thereupon be
converted into rights with respect to Dell Common Stock. Accordingly, from
and after the Effective Time: (A) each Outstanding Unvested Company Option
assumed or replaced by Dell Inc. may be exercised solely for shares of Dell
Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Dell Common Stock subject to
each Outstanding Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by Dell Inc.
shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Outstanding Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as
defined below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Dell Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for
the Dell Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Outstanding Unvested
Company Option assumed or replaced by Dell Inc. shall be determined
by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to
such Outstanding Unvested Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms
of the stock option agreement by which such Outstanding Unvested Company
Option is evidenced, any restriction on the exercise of any Outstanding
Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by Dell Inc. shall continue in
full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule
and other provisions of such Outstanding Unvested Company Option shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of
such Outstanding Unvested Company Option; _provided, however_ , that Dell
Inc.s board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each Outstanding Unvested Company Option
assumed or replaced by Dell Inc. The "Conversion Ratio" shall be equal to the
fraction having a numerator equal to $27.75 and having a denominator equal
to the average of the closing sale prices of a share of Dell Common Stock as
reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for each of the five consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Average Parent
Stock Price"); _provided, however_ , that if, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Dell Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall
be adjusted to the extent appropriate. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Dell Inc. shall send or caused to be sent to each holder of an Outstanding
Unvested Company Option that is (A) assumed by Dell Inc. a written notice
setting forth (1) the number of shares of Dell Common Stock subject to such
assumed Outstanding Unvested Company Option, and (2) the exercise price per
share of Dell Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Outstanding
Unvested Company Option and (B) replaced by Dell Inc. a written stock option
agreement containing all the terms of such replaced Outstanding Unvested
Company Option, including (x) the number of shares of Dell Common
Stock subject to such replaced Outstanding Unvested Company Option, and (y)
the exercise price per share of Dell Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such replaced Outstanding Unvested Company Option. Dell Inc. shall file with
the SEC, no later than 20 business days after the Effective Time,
a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares of Dell Common
Stock issuable with respect to the assumed and replaced Outstanding Unvested
Company Options. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, if Dell Inc. determines that it desires to do so, Dell Inc. may assume any or all of the Company Equity Plans or merge any such Company Equity Plan into any equity incentive plan of Parent. If Dell Inc. elects to so assume or merge any Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity Plan, Dell Inc. shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Equity Plan as of the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of Outstanding Unvested Company Options that are assumed or replaced by Dell Inc. pursuant to Section 5.3(a)), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Dell Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Dell Common Stock determined by 

   ##### 

  

 

multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the
Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Dell Common Stock; and (iii) Dell Inc.s board of
directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority
and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any committee
thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Equity Plan. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.2 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 5.2. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period under the ESPP to be terminated as of the last business day prior to the Closing Date; (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of the last business day prior to the Closing Date) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP; and (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP after the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On such new exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company shall terminate the ESPP. 

  

 5.4 Employee Benefits. 

  

 (a) If Parent elects not to maintain any Company Employee Plan that is a health, vacation or 401(k) plan after the Effective Time, then, subject to any necessary transition period and subject to any applicable Dell Inc. plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements: (i) all employees of the Acquired Corporations who continue employment with Dell Inc., the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Dell Inc. or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate in Dell Inc.s health, vacation and 401(k) plans, programs or arrangements, to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Dell Inc.; and (ii) for purposes of determining a Continuing Employees eligibility to participate in such plans, such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plans for his or her years of continuous service with the Acquired Corporations prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause Dell Inc. or the Surviving Corporation to, credit to each Continuing Employee the amount of vacation time and paid time off that such individual had accrued under any applicable Company Employee Plan as of the Effective Time. If Dell Inc. chooses not to maintain one or more of Company Employee Plans that is a health plan or welfare plan, then with respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained in lieu of the applicable Company Employee Plan, Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Employee Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Dell Inc. or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Nothing in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with Dell Inc., the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Dell Inc. Except for persons indemnified pursuant to Section 5.5 (to the extent of their rights pursuant to Section 5.5), no Company Associate and no Continuing Employee shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall limit the effect of Section 9.8.

If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, whose approval will not be unreasonably withheld).

 5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause (including by providing any necessary funding to) the Surviving Corporation (i) to assume and perform all rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all rights to advancement of expenses to, the current or former directors and officers of the Company as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or the Companys bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and as provided to such directors and officers in the indemnification agreements that are identified in Part 5.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and forms of which have been made available to Parent, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions), and such rights shall continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) to include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors. 

  

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor "tail" policies of an insurance company with the same or better rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the material 

   ##### 

  

 

terms of the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) Parent
may request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage
under the Companys existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the
Effective Time); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate premiums for
insurance under this Section 5.5(b) in excess of 300% of the amount of the
aggregate premiums paid by the Company for 2010 for such purpose (which 2010
premiums are hereby represented and warranted by Company to be as set forth
in Part 2.26 of the Disclosure Schedule), it being understood that Parent
shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained
for such 300% amount. 

   

 (c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5(c). 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.5 shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives. 

  

 5.6 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the Company and Parent shall each promptly deliver to the other a copy of each such filing or other submission made by the Company or Parent during the Pre-Closing Period. Neither the Company nor Parent shall engage or participate in any communication with the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice regarding the Contemplated Transactions absent the participation of the other (unless such Governmental Body refuses to allow participation of Parent or the Company), and the Company and Parent shall each promptly inform the other of the substance of any material communication regarding the Contemplated Transactions with any Governmental Body with authority over antitrust or competition matters if a Representative of the other is not present when such communication is made. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information by one party to the other may be made on an outside counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Legal Requirements or as appropriate to protect confidential business information or the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product. 

  

 (d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or advisable to complete processes and satisfy requirements that apply with respect to change of ownership of the Company in connection with Government Contracts, including any required novation processes.
