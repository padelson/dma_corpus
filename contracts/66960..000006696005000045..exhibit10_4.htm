1.2 _Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters_. Unless otherwise
expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of
interpretation apply:

  

(a) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of
time before which, within which, or following which any act is to be done or
step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period will be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question will end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

  



  

(b) _Dollars_. Any reference in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$"
means U.S. dollars.

  



  

(c) _Exhibits and Schedules_. Unless otherwise expressly indicated,
any reference in this Agreement to an "Exhibit" or a "Schedule" refers to an
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof as if set forth in
full herein and are an integral part of

  



  

11

  



  

  



  

this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein are defined as set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender
includes all genders, and the meaning of defined terms applies to both the
singular and the plural of those terms.

  

(e) _Headings_. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division
of this Agreement into Articles, Sections, and other subdivisions, and the
insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect,
and will not be utilized in construing or interpreting, this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section
of this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

  

(f) " _Herein_ ". The words such as " _herein_ ," " _hereinafter_ ,"
" _hereof_ ," and " _hereunder_ " refer to this Agreement (including the
Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement) as a whole and not merely to a
subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

  

(g) " _Including_ ". The word " _including_ " or any variation
thereof means " _including, without limitation_ " and does not limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

  

(h) " _To the extent_ ". The words " _to the extent_ " when used in
reference to a liability or other matter, means that the liability or other
matter referred to is included in part or excluded in part, with the portion
included or excluded determined based on the portion of such liability or
other matter exclusively related to the subject. For example, if 40 percent of
a liability is attributable to the Business, then a statement that Buyer will
assume the liability "to the extent related to the operation of the Business"
means that Buyer will assume 40 percent of the liability. As an additional
example, if a performance obligation attributable to the Business is by its
terms to be performed prior to and following the Effective Time, a statement
that Buyer will assume the obligation "to the extent such obligation relates
to the period from and after the Effective Time" means that Buyer will assume
all liability for the performance from and after the Effective Time, and that
Seller would remain liable for any failure to perform such obligations prior
to the Effective Time.

  

(i) " _Principally in the Business_ ". With reference to assets
owned by Seller, and liabilities of Seller, which are used by, in, or for, or
relate to, the Business, the phrases "principally in the Business,"
"principally for the Business," and other statements of similar import will be
construed to refer to assets or liabilities that are: (A) specifically listed
in a Schedule setting forth Purchased Assets or Assumed Obligations; or (B)
otherwise are devoted principally to (or in the case of liabilities, are
related principally to) the Business other than Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities.

  

1.3 _Joint Negotiation and Preparation of Agreement_. The Parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement
and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement will be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties hereto and
no presumption or burden of proof favoring or disfavoring any Party will exist
or arise by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

  |  

3.2

  |  

_Determination of Purchase Price_. 

---|---|--- 
  



  



  

17

  



  

  



  



  

(a) No later than 15 days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will
prepare and deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of the Purchase Price,
based on Sellers good faith estimates of the Adjustment Amount and the
Closing Assumed Indebtedness Amount (such estimated Purchase Price being
referred to herein as the " _Closing Payment Amount_ ").

  

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ ")
that reflects Sellers determination of (i) the Adjustment Amount, (ii) the
Closing Assumed Indebtedness Amount, and (iii) the Purchase Price based on the
Adjustment Amount and the Closing Assumed Indebtedness Amount. In addition,
Seller will provide Buyer with supporting calculations, in reasonable detail,
for such determinations at the time it delivers the Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in connection with Sellers
preparation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement and related information,
and will provide Seller with access to its books, records, information, and
employees as Seller may reasonably request.

  

(c) The amounts determined by Seller as set forth in the Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement _ ****_ will be final, binding, and conclusive for all
purposes unless, and only to the extent, that within 30 **** days after Seller
has delivered the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement Buyer notifies Seller of
any dispute with matters set forth in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement.
Any such notice of dispute delivered by Buyer (an " _Adjustment Dispute
Notice_ ") will identify with specificity each item in the Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement with respect to which Buyer disagrees, the basis of such
disagreement, and Buyers position with respect to such disputed item.

  

(d) If Buyer delivers an Adjustment Dispute Notice in compliance with
Section 3.2(c), then (i) the undisputed portion of the total proposed
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement (together
with interest thereon for the period commencing on the Closing Date through
the date of payment calculated at the Prime Rate in effect on the Closing
Date) will be paid by Seller or Buyer, as appropriate, in accordance with the
payment procedures set forth in Section 3.2(e); and (ii) Buyer and Seller will
attempt to reconcile their differences and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts will be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes on
the Parties. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach a resolution with respect
to all disputed items within 45 days of delivery of the Adjustment Dispute
Notice, Buyer and Seller will submit any items remaining in dispute for
determination and resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm, which will be
instructed to determine and report to Buyer and Seller, within 30 days after
such submission, upon such remaining disputed items. The report of the
Independent Accounting Firm will be final, binding, and conclusive on the
Parties for all purposes. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm will be allocated between Buyer and Seller so that Buyers
share of such fees and disbursements will be in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer (as
finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total
amount of such remaining disputed amounts so submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm.

  



  

18

  



  

  



  



  

(e) Within five days following the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 3.2(c) and 3.2(d), (i) if the Purchase
Price is greater than the Closing Payment Amount, Buyer will pay the
difference (adjusted to reflect any payment pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(i)) to
Seller; or (ii) if the Purchase Price is less than the Closing Payment Amount,
Seller will pay the difference (adjusted to reflect any payment pursuant to
Section 3.2(d)(i)) to Buyer. Any amount paid under this Section 3.2(e) will be
paid with interest for the period commencing on the Closing Date through the
date of payment, calculated at the Prime Rate in effect on the Closing Date,
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the Party receiving payment.

  

3.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The sum of the Purchase Price
and the Assumed Obligations will be allocated among the Purchased Assets on a
basis consistent with section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Within 60 days following the final determination of the Purchase
Price, Buyer and Seller will work together in good faith to agree upon such
allocation; provided that in the event that such agreement has not have been
reached within such 60-day period, the allocation will be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination will be binding on the
Parties. Each of Buyer and Seller will pay one-half of the fees and expenses
of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with such determination. Each
Party will report the transactions contemplated by the Agreement for federal
Income Tax and all other Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such
allocation. Buyer and Seller will provide the other promptly with any other
information required to complete Form 8594 under the Code. Each Party will
notify the other Parties, and will provide the other with reasonably requested
cooperation, in the event of an examination, audit, or other proceeding
regarding the allocations provided for in this Section 3.3.

        



  |  

3.4

  |  

_Proration_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) All Taxes, utility charges, and similar items customarily
prorated, including those listed below, to the extent relating to the Business
or the Purchased Assets will be prorated as of the Effective Time, with Seller
liable to the extent such items relate to any period prior to the Effective
Time, and Buyer liable to the extent such items relate to any period from and
after the Effective Time. To the extent that Seller determines in good faith
that amounts to be prorated under this Section 3.4 can be reasonably estimated
at Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with such estimate and the Buyer and
Seller shall adjust the amounts paid at Closing to reflect such prorations.
Such items to be prorated will include:

  

(i) personal property and real property Taxes, assessments,
franchise Taxes, and other similar charges, including charges for water,
telephone, electricity, and other utilities;

  

(ii) any permit, license, registration, compliance assurance fees or
other fees with respect to any Transferable Permits and Transferable
Environmental Permits; and

  



  

19

  



  

  



  



  

(iii) rents under any leases of real or personal property (including
all payments under the JEC Lease).

  

(b) In connection with any real property Tax prorations, including
installments of special assessments, Buyer will be credited with an amount
equal to the amount of the current real property Tax or installment of special
assessments, as the case may be, multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator
of which is the number of days from the date of the immediately preceding
installment to the day before the Closing Date, and (ii) the denominator of
which is the total number of days in the assessment period in which the
Closing Date occurs. In connection with any other prorations, in the event
that actual amounts are not available at the Closing Date, the proration will
be based upon the Taxes, assessments, charges, fees, or rents for the most
recent period completed prior to the Closing Date for which actual Taxes,
assessments, charges, fees, or rents are available. All prorations will be
based upon the most recent available Tax rates, assessments, and valuations.
Any prorations shall be made so as to avoid duplication of any items, and will
not include items which are otherwise taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price, including the Adjustment Amount.

  

(c) The proration of all items under this Section 3.4 will be
recalculated by Buyer within 60 days following the date upon which the actual
amounts become available to Buyer. Buyer will notify Seller promptly of such
recalculated amounts, and will provide Seller with all documentation relating
to such recalculations, including tax statements and other notices from third
parties. Seller and Buyer will make such payments to each other as are
necessary to reconcile any estimated amounts prorated as of the Effective Time
with the final amounts to be prorated. Seller and Buyer agree to furnish each
other with such documents and other records as may be reasonably requested in
order to confirm all proration calculations made pursuant to this Section 3.4.

  

 **ARTICLE IV**

result of the specific regulatory status of Buyer (or any of its Affiliates)
or as a result of any other facts that specifically relate to any business or
activities in which Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is or proposes to be
engaged.

5.12

  |  

_ERISA; Benefit Plans_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Schedule 5.12(a)_ lists each employee benefit plan (as such
term is defined in section 3(3) of ERISA) and each other health, accident,
life insurance, disability, equity compensation, bonus, deferred or incentive
compensation, retention, change in control, severance or separation, pension,

arrangement providing benefits to employees that is maintained by, contributed

the date hereof on account of current Business Employees or persons who have
retired or may retire from, or terminated employment with, the Business (each,
a " _Benefit Plan_ "). Copies of such plans and all amendments thereto,
together with the most recent annual report and actuarial report with respect
thereto, if any, have been made available to Buyer.

  

(b) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination from the Internal Revenue
Service that such Benefit Plan is so qualified, and each trust that is
intended to be exempt under section 501(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter that such trust is so exempt. Nothing has occurred since
the date of such determination that would materially adversely affect the
qualified or exempt status of such Benefit Plan or trust, nor will the
consummation of the transactions provided for by this Agreement have any such
effect. Seller has made available to Buyer a copy of the most recent
determination letter of the IRS with respect to each such Benefit Plan or
trust.

  

(c) Each Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded, and administered
in material compliance with its terms, the terms of any applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreements, and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.
There is no "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of section 412
of the Code with respect to any Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension
benefit plan" as defined in section 3(2) of ERISA and no such Benefit Plan has
applied for or received a waiver of an accumulated funding or an extension of
any amortization period within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or

the Purchased Assets or Business. Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has
been required to provide information to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation under Section 4010 of ERISA with respect to any Benefit Plan for
the last three plan years. No proceeding has been initiated to terminate the
Seller Pension Plan or any other Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA. Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to contribute
to or any other liability under or with respect to any multiemployer plan (as

that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a
material risk to Seller or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any
such liability, other than liability for premiums due to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation. No Person has provided or is required to

Code due to a plan amendment that results in an increase in current liability.

_Schedule 5.12(d)_ , there have been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions"
as described in section 4975 of the Code or Title I, Part 4 of ERISA involving
any Benefit Plan, and to Sellers Knowledge there are no facts or
circumstances which could give rise to any tax imposed by section 4975 of the
Code with respect to any Benefit Plan.

  

(e) All contributions (including all employer matching and other
contributions and all employee salary reduction contributions) for all periods
ending prior to the Effective Time (including periods from the first day of
the current plan year to the Effective Time) have been paid to the Benefit
Plans within the time required by Law or will be paid to the Benefit Plans
prior to or as of the Closing, notwithstanding any provision of any Benefit
Plan to the contrary. All returns, reports, and disclosure statements required
to be made under ERISA and the Code with respect to the Benefit Plans have
been timely filed or delivered.

  

(f) Each Benefit Plan that is a group health plan (within the
meaning of Code section 5000(b)(1)) in all material respects complies with and

provide, and is not obligated to provide medical or life insurance benefits
currently provided by Seller to any currently retired or former employees of
the Business other than pursuant to Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA,
section 4980B of the Code, or similar provisions of state law.

  

(h) Except as provided in Section 7.9, no provision of any Benefit
Plan would require the payment by Buyer of any money or other property, or the
provision by Buyer of any other rights or benefits, to any employee or former
employee of Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute payment
within the meaning of section 280G of the Code.

  

(i) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.12(d) or Schedule 5.12(i),
there are no actions, suits or claims pending, or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened (other than routine claims for benefits) with respect to any
Benefit Plan.

  

(j) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.12(j), to Sellers Knowledge
there are no audits, inquiries, or proceedings pending or threatened by any
Governmental Entity with respect to any Benefit Plan.

  



  

27

  



  

  



  



  

(k) Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of section 409A of the Code) has been administered
in good faith compliance with the requirements of section 409A and the
Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder.

  

(l) Each Benefit Plan that provides prescription drug coverage to
Medicare-eligible retirees (or their Medicare-eligible dependents) is expected
to be a "qualified retiree prescription drug plan" (within the meaning of 42
CFR Section 423.882) and Seller will timely apply for the Medicare Part D
retiree drug subsidy with respect to each such Benefit Plan in accordance with
the requirements of 42 CFR Part 423, Subpart R. Seller has provided or will
make available to Buyer copies of the subsidy application as completed as of

insolvency, moratorium, or other similar laws affecting or relating to
enforcement of creditors rights generally or general principles of equity.

  

6.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 6.3_ , the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Buyer

(a) conflict with or result in any breach of the Governing Documents
of such Buyer Party;

  

(b) result in a material default (including with notice, lapse of
time, or both), or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, or
acceleration, under any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, agreement, lease, or other instrument or obligation
to which such Buyer Party or any of its Affiliates is a party or by which such
Buyer Party or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective assets may be
bound, except for such defaults (or rights of termination, cancellation, or
acceleration) as to which requisite waivers or consents have been, or will
prior to the Effective Time be, obtained or which if not obtained or made
would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

30

  



  

  



  



  

(c) violate any Law or Order applicable to such Buyer Party, any of
its Affiliates, or any of their respective assets;

  

(d) require any declaration, filing, or registration with, or notice
to, or authorization, consent, or approval of any Governmental Entity, other

filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents, or approvals which,
if not obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

6.4 _Regulation as a Utility_. Neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates is a "Holding Company," a "Subsidiary Company," or an "Affiliate"
of a "Holding Company" within the meaning of the Holding Company Act.

  

6.5 _Buyer s Knowledge_. Such Buyer Party is a sophisticated party,
and has conducted (or has had conducted on its behalf) a due diligence
investigation of the Business, the Purchased Assets, and the Assumed
Obligations to the fullest extent permitted by Seller. Such Buyer Party
understands and agrees that any financial forecasts or projections relating to
the Business prepared by or on behalf of Seller have been provided to such
Buyer Party with the understanding and agreement that Seller is making no
representation or warranty with respect to such forecasts or projections and
that actual future results will vary from those forecast or projected based
upon numerous factors. Such Buyer Party does not have knowledge of any
inaccuracy or breach of or in any of Sellers factual representations,
warranties, or other statements set forth in this Agreement or any of the
Exhibits or Schedules hereto.

  

6.6 _Fees and Commissions_. Seller acknowledges that UBS Securities,
LLC has been retained by one or more of the Buyer Parties as an advisor in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no broker, finder, or other Person is entitled to any brokerage
fees, commissions, or finders fees for which Seller could become liable or
obligated in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby by reason of
any action taken by such Buyer Party.

  

6.7 _Financial Capability_. Buyer (i) has received a written

Financing Commitment to the effect of the foregoing has been satisfied.

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

7.1

  |  

Conduct of Business. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Except as contemplated in this Agreement, required by any
Business Agreement, Law, or Order, or otherwise described in _Schedule 7.1_ ,
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller
will operate the Purchased Assets and the Business in the ordinary course
consistent with Good Utility Practice and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve intact the Business, and to preserve the goodwill and
relationships with customers, suppliers, and others having business dealings
with the Business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
contemplated in this Agreement, required by any Business Agreement, Law, or
Order, or otherwise described in _Schedule 7.1_ , prior to the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, Seller will not:

  

(i) create, incur, assume, or suffer to exist any Encumbrance (other
than Permitted Encumbrances) upon the Purchased Assets;

  

(ii) make any material change in the level of inventories customarily
maintained by Seller with respect to the Business, other than in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with Good Utility Practice;

  

(iii) other than any such sales, leases, transfers, or dispositions
involving any Purchased Assets involving less than $25,000 **** on an
individual basis, or $100,000 in the aggregate, sell, lease (as lessor),
transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of the Purchased Assets, other than (A)
in the ordinary course of business, (B) consistent with Good Utility Practice,
or (C) to the extent that any such sales, leases, transfers, or dispositions
are reflected in the Adjustment Amount;

  

(iv) other than in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
Good Utility Practice, (A) enter into, terminate, extend, renew, or otherwise
amend any material Business Agreement, or (B) waive any material default by,
or release, settle, or compromise any material claim against, any other Person
who is a party thereto;

  

(v) grant severance or termination pay to any present or former
employee of the Business that would be the responsibility of Buyer;

  

(vi) enter into any collective bargaining agreement in which the terms
and conditions to be applicable to Transferred Employees materially differ
from those currently applicable to Business Employees, except where such
differences are appropriate based upon job classifications or seniority;

  

(vii) grant any increase in the compensation of or grant or agree to any
bonus for Business Employees not covered by collective bargaining who will

  



  

32

  



  

  



  

become Transferred Employees, except for increases and bonuses in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice;

  

(viii) incur any obligation which would represent additional Assumed
Indebtedness (other than interest accruing under the terms of the Assumed
Indebtedness); or

  

(ix) agree or commit to take any action which would be a violation of
the restrictions set forth in Section 7.1(a)(i) through Section 7.1(a)(viii).

  

(b) A committee comprised of one Person designated by Seller and one
Person designated by Buyer, and such additional Persons as may be appointed by
the Persons originally appointed to such committee (the " _Transition
Committee_ ") will be established promptly following the execution of this
Agreement to examine transition issues relating to or arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. From time to time, the Transition
Committee will report its findings to the senior management of each of Seller
and Buyer.

        



  |  

7.2

  |  

_Access to Information_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller
will, during ordinary business hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) give
Buyer and Buyers Representatives reasonable access to the Purchased Assets to
which Buyer is not denied access by Law and to which Seller has the right to
grant access without the consent of any other Person (and in the case where
consent of another Person is required, only on such terms and conditions as
may be imposed by such other Person); (ii) permit Buyer to make such
reasonable inspections thereof as Buyer may reasonably request; (iii) furnish
Buyer with such financial and operating data and other information with
respect to the Business as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; and
(iv) furnish Buyer with a copy of each material report, schedule, or other
document principally relating to the Business filed by Seller with, or
received by Seller from, any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that (A)
any such investigation will be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operation of the Business or any other Person, (B) Buyer
will indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any Losses caused to
Seller by any action of Buyer or Buyers Representatives while present on any
of the Purchased Assets or other premises to which Buyer is granted access
hereunder (including restoring any such premises to the condition
substantially equivalent to the condition such premises were in prior to any
such investigation), (C) Seller will not be required to take any action which
would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, and (D) Seller
need not supply Buyer with any information which Seller is under a contractual
or other legal obligation not to supply; provided, however, if Seller relies
upon clauses (C) or (D) as a basis for withholding information from disclosure
to Buyer, to the fullest extent possible without causing a waiver of the
attorney-client privilege, or a violation of a contractual or legal
obligation, as the case may be, Seller will provide Buyer with a description
of the information withheld and the basis for withholding such information.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary, (x) no Buyer
Party will have access to personnel and medical records if such

  



  

33

  



  

  



  

access could, in Sellers good faith judgment, subject Seller to risk of
liability or otherwise violate the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, and (y) any investigation of environmental matters
by or on behalf of Buyer will be limited to visual inspections and site visits
commonly included in the scope of "Phase 1" level environmental inspections,
and no Buyer Party will have the right to perform or conduct any other
sampling or testing at, in, on, or underneath any of the Purchased Assets.

  

(b) Unless and until the transactions contemplated hereby have been
consummated, each Buyer Party will, and will cause its Affiliates and Buyers
Representatives to, hold in strict confidence and not use or disclose to any
other Person all Confidential Information. " _Confidential Information_ "
means all information in any form heretofore or hereafter obtained from Seller
in connection with any Buyer Partys evaluation of the Business or the
negotiation of this Agreement, whether pertaining to financial condition,
results of operations, methods of operation or otherwise, other than
information which is in the public domain through no violation of this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement by any Buyer Party, its
Affiliates, or Buyers Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Buyer
Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such
information is required to be disclosed by such Buyer Party by Law or in
connection with any proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity, including
any disclosure, financial or otherwise, required to comply with any SEC rules.
In the event that any Buyer Party believes any such disclosure is required,
such Buyer Party will give Seller notice thereof as promptly as possible and
will cooperate with Seller in seeking any protective orders or other relief as
Seller may determine to be necessary or desirable. In no event will any Buyer
Party make or permit to be made any disclosure of Confidential Information
other than to the extent such Buyer Partys legal counsel has advised in
writing is required by Law, and such Buyer Party will use its best efforts to
assure that any Confidential Information so disclosed is protected from
further disclosure to the maximum extent permitted by Law. If the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, each Buyer Party will promptly return
to Seller all copies of any Confidential Information, including any materials
prepared by such Buyer Party or Buyers Representatives incorporating or
reflecting Confidential Information, and an officer of such Buyer Party shall
certify in writing compliance by such Buyer Party with the foregoing.

  

(c) Each Buyer Party agrees that, without Sellers written consent,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, neither such Buyer Party
nor any Affiliate of such Buyer Party will directly or indirectly solicit for
employment or employ any person who is now employed by Seller; provided, that
a Buyer Party and its Affiliates are not prohibited from: (i) employing a
person who contacts such Buyer Party or its Affiliates on his own initiative
and without any direct or indirect solicitation by such Buyer Party or its
Affiliates; or (ii) conducting generalized solicitations for employees that
are not specifically targeted at Sellers employees, through the use of media
advertisements, professional search firms, or otherwise.

  

(d) The provisions of Section 7.2(b) and 7.2(c) supersede the
Confidentiality Agreement, and will survive for a period of two years
following the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, except that if the
Closing occurs, the provisions of Section

  



  

34

  



  

  



  

7.2(b) will expire with respect to any information principally related to the
Purchased Assets and the Business.

  

(e) For a period of seven **** years after the Closing Date, each
Party and its representatives will have reasonable access to all of the books
and records relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets, including all
Transferred Employee Records, in the possession of any other Party to the
extent that such access may reasonably be required by such Party in connection
with the Assumed Obligations or the Excluded Liabilities, or other matters
relating to or affected by the operation of the Business and the Purchased
Assets. Such access will be afforded by the Party in possession of such books
and records upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours; provided, however, that (i) any review of books and records
will be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the business of any Party or its Affiliates, (ii) no Party will
be required to take any action which would constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client privilege, and (iii) no Party need supply any other Party with
any information which such Party is under a contractual or other legal
obligation not to supply. The Party exercising the right of access hereunder
will be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant
to this Section 7.2(e). If Seller or any Buyer Party in possession of such
books and records desires to dispose of any such books and records prior to
the expiration of such seven-year period, such Party will, prior to such
disposition, give Buyer or Seller, respectively, a reasonable opportunity at
such other Partys expense to segregate and take possession of such books and
records as such other Party may select.

        



  |  

7.3

  |  

_Expenses_. 

---|---|--- 
  

Except to the extent specifically provided herein, and irrespective of whether
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby will be borne by the Party incurring such costs and expenses, except
Buyer and Seller will each pay 50% of the following expenses: (i) all filing
fees in connection any Required Regulatory Approvals, and (ii) except as
provided in Section 7.7, all other filing, recording, transfer, or other fees
or charges of any nature payable pursuant to any provision of Law or any Order
or Franchise in connection with the sale, transfer, and assignment of the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Obligations.

  

7.4 _Further Assurances; Procedures with Respect to Certain
Agreements and other Assets_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby, including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each Partys obligations hereunder
within its reasonable control. Neither Seller nor any Buyer Party will,
without the prior written consent of Buyer or Seller, respectively, take any
action which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede,
interfere with or delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. From
time to time on or after the

  



  

35

  



  

  



  

Closing Date, Seller will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such
documents to any Buyer Party as such Buyer Party may reasonably request in
order to more effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
between Seller and such Buyer Party. From time to time after the date hereof,
each Buyer Party will, at its own expense, (i) execute and deliver such
documents to Seller as Seller may reasonably request in order to more
effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby between Seller and
such Buyer Party, and (ii) cooperate with Seller in connection with obtaining
any releases or discharges of Seller from any of the Assumed Obligations.

  

(b) Seller has easements, license agreements (including railroad
crossing rights), rights-of-way, and leases for rights-of-way, some of which
relate solely to the Business and Purchased Assets (the " _Easements_ ") and
others of which relate to both the Business and Purchased Assets and Sellers
other businesses (the " _Shared Easements_ "). At the Closing, Seller will
convey and assign to Buyer, subject to the obtaining of any necessary
consents, (i) by the Assignment of Easements, all Easements, and (ii) by
separate sub-easement or other document, sufficient rights under the Shared
Easements to permit Buyer to use the same, as presently used by Seller
with respect to the Business, on a nonexclusive basis (the " _Shared Easement
Rights_ ").

  

(c) To the extent that Sellers rights under any Business Agreement
may not be assigned without the consent of another Person which consent has
not been obtained, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign
the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be
unlawful. Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts (without being
required to make any payment to any third party or to incur any economic
burden) to obtain any such required consent as promptly as possible. Buyer
agrees to cooperate with Seller in its efforts to obtain any such consent
(including the submission of such financial or other information concerning
Buyer and the execution of any assumption agreements or similar documents
reasonably requested by a third party) without being required to make any
payment to any third party (other than as provided under Section 7.3) or to
incur any economic burden (other than the assumption of Sellers obligations
under the applicable Business Agreement). Seller and Buyer agree that if any
consent to an assignment of any Business Agreement is not obtained or if any
attempted assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyers rights and
obligations under the Business Agreement in question so that Buyer would not
acquire the benefit of all such rights and obligations, then (i) Seller may
elect to exercise its rights under Section 7.4(d) with respect to any such
Business Agreement that is a personal property lease, or (ii) if Seller does
not exercise such rights or if such Business Agreement is not a personal
property lease, then at the Closing Seller and Buyer will, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law and such Business Agreement, enter into such
arrangements with each other as are reasonably necessary to provide Buyer
with the benefits and obligations of such Business Agreement from and after
the Effective Time.

  

(d) With respect to equipment or other personal property that is used
principally for the Business and that is leased by Seller either (i) pursuant
to a personal property lease that is a Business Agreement that cannot be
assigned to Buyer, or (ii) pursuant to any other agreements, Seller will prior
to the Effective Time purchase the assets leased under such lease and used
principally for the Business, or cause title to such

  



  

36

  



  

  



  

assets to be transferred directly by the lessor to Buyer as of the Effective
Time, and such assets will be included in the Purchased Assets, if such
purchase can be accomplished on a commercially reasonable basis; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to the JEC Lease,
which shall be governed by Section 7.13 hereof.

  

(e) The Parties have agreed that the agreements set forth on
_Schedule 7.4(e)_ (the " _Shared Agreements_ ") will be governed by this
Section 7.4(e) and are not Business Agreements. Sellers rights and
obligations under the Shared Agreements, to the extent such rights and
obligations relate to the Business, are described on _Schedule 7.4(e)_ , and
are referred to herein as the " _Allocated Rights and Obligations_." Unless
Seller elects to enter into Other Arrangements, Buyer and Seller agree to
cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into agreements with the other party or parties to each Shared Agreement
providing for (i) assignment to and assumption by Buyer, effective from and
after the Effective Time, of the Allocated Rights and Obligations, and (ii)
retention by Seller of all rights and obligations of Seller under the Shared
Agreements other than the Allocated Rights and Obligations (such agreements
set forth in (i) and (ii) being referred to as " _Substitute Arrangements_ ");
provided, that neither Seller nor Buyer will be obligated to enter into or
agree to any such Substitute Arrangements unless such Substitute Arrangements
have the effect of transferring to the Buyer the Allocated Rights and
Obligations (and reserving to Seller the rights and obligations which are not
Allocated Rights and Obligations) on a fair and equitable basis, as determined
in the reasonable discretion of Seller and Buyer. In connection with the
foregoing, the Parties agree, as reasonably requested, to submit such
financial or other information concerning themselves, and to execute such
assumption agreements or similar documents reasonably requested by a third
party; provided that neither Party will be required to make any payment to any
third party or to incur any economic burden (other than the assumption of the
Allocated Rights and Obligations by Buyer, and the retention of the other
rights and obligations under the Shared Agreements by Seller). In the event
that (x) Buyer and Seller are unable to enter into Substitute Arrangements
with respect to a Shared Agreement in accordance with the foregoing, or (y)
Seller notifies Buyer that it elects not to pursue Substitute Arrangements
with respect to such Shared Agreement, then in either case at the Closing
Buyer and Seller will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law and such Shared
Agreement, enter into such arrangements with each other as are necessary to
provide Buyer with the benefits and obligations of the Allocated Rights and
Obligations under such Shared Agreement, with Seller retaining the other
benefits and obligations under such Shared Agreement from and after the
Effective Time (the " _Other Arrangements_ ").

  

(f) Seller from time to time provides collateral or other security
(including prepayments) to certain other Persons in connection with certain
Business Agreements and Shared Agreements. Seller and Buyer agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such collateral or other security to
be returned to Seller (including in the case of a letter of credit a return of
the letter of credit to Seller), or released (in the case of other credit
support previously provided by Seller) at the Closing. In the event that such
collateral or other security is not returned to Seller or otherwise released
at the Closing or, in the case of prepayments, credited to Seller in
determining the Adjustment Amount, at the Closing Buyer will pay to Seller an
amount equal to any cash collateral posted or

  



  

37

  



  

  



  

prepayment made by Seller (in which case such cash collateral and amount of
such prepayments shall be a Purchased Asset) or otherwise compensate Seller
for such collateral or other security in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Seller.

  

(g) Following the Closing, each Party will promptly remit to the
appropriate Party any payments such Party receives that are in satisfaction of
any rights or assets belonging to such other Party.

        



  |  

7.5

  |  

_Public Statements_. 

---|---|--- 
  

Seller and each Buyer Party will consult with Buyer or Seller, respectively,
prior to issuing, and will consider in good faith any comments by the other to
or in respect of, any public announcement, statement, or other disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except as
may be required by Law or stock exchange rules and provided that any such
public announcement, statement, or other disclosure issued by any Buyer Party
will be subject to Section 7.2(b).

        



  |  

7.6

  |  

_Consents and Approvals_.

entities thereof) will each file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division any
notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act and the rules and

contemplated hereby. The Parties will consult and cooperate with each other as
to the appropriate time of filing such notifications and will (i) make such
filings at the agreed upon time, (ii) respond promptly to any requests for
additional information made by either of such agencies, and (iii) use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act
to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date of such
filings.

  

(b) The Parties will cooperate with each other and use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) promptly prepare and file all necessary

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Required Regulatory
Approvals), (ii) obtain the transfer to Buyer of all Transferable Permits and
Transferable Environmental Permits, and the reissuance to Buyer of all Permits
that are not Transferable Permits and all Environmental Permits that are not
Transferable Environmental Permits, (iii) obtain the consents, approvals, and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities to the extent required by Law or
Order for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Required Regulatory Approvals) (including by taking all
structural corporate actions necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby in a timely manner), and (iv) obtain all consents,
approvals, and authorizations of all other Persons to the extent necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required by the
terms of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
franchise, permit, concession, contract, lease, or other instrument to which
Seller or any Buyer Party is a party or by which either of them is bound.
Seller and Buyer each will have the right to

  



  

38

  



  

  



  

review in advance all characterizations of the information relating to it or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which appear in any filing
made by any Party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(c) No Party will on an _ex parte_ basis initiate, directly or
indirectly, any communications, meetings, or other contacts with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
any matters relating to any declaration, filing, or registration with, notice
to, or authorization, consent, or approval of any such Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement. In connection with any communications,
meetings, or other contacts, formal or informal, oral or written, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
any such declaration, filing, registration, notice, authorization, consent, or
approval, Seller and each Buyer Party agrees: (i) to inform Buyer or Seller,
respectively, in advance of any such communication, meeting, or other contact
which such Party proposes or intends to make, including the subject matter,
contents, intended agenda, and other aspects of any of the foregoing; (ii) to
consult and cooperate with Buyer or Seller, respectively, and to take into
account the comments of such other Party in connection with any of the matters
covered by Section 7.6(c)(i); (iii) to arrange for representatives of Buyer or
Seller, respectively, to participate to the maximum extent possible in any
such communications, meetings, or other contacts; (iv) to notify Buyer or
Seller, respectively of any oral communications with any Governmental Entity
relating to any of the foregoing; and (v) to provide Buyer or Seller,
respectively with copies of all written communications with any Governmental
Entity relating to any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 7.6 will apply to or restrict communications or
other actions by Seller with or with regard to Governmental Entities in
connection with (x) the Purchased Assets or the Business in the ordinary
course of business, or (y) the transactions contemplated by Section 7.9.

  

(d) Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other and promptly
prepare and file notifications with, and request Tax clearances from, state
and local taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which a portion of the
Purchase Price may be required to be withheld or in which Buyer would
otherwise be liable for any Tax liabilities of Seller pursuant to such state
and local Tax Law (other than any such liabilities which under the terms
hereof are to be paid by Buyer).

7.7

  |  

_Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) All transfer, documentary, stamp, registration, sales and use
Taxes, including real property conveyance Taxes, incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by Buyer,
and Buyer, at its own expense, will file, to the extent required by applicable
Law, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all

7.8

  |  

_Supplements to Schedules_. 

---|---|--- 
  

Prior to the Closing Date, Seller may supplement or amend the Schedules
furnished by it under this Agreement to properly reflect matters arising after
the date hereof that are not prohibited by Section 7.1, or (in the case of
items that are based on Sellers knowledge) matters of which Seller first
acquires knowledge after the date hereof, except that _Schedules 7.1_ ,
_8.1(d)_ , and _8.3(e)_ may not be supplemented or amended. In the event that
such supplements and amendments reflect matters that, considered collectively,
would constitute or give rise to a Material Adverse Effect if not set forth in
such Schedules, Buyer may either (i) terminate this Agreement without
liability to or of any Party, or (ii) not so terminate this Agreement (in
which event any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller which
would otherwise exist absent such supplements and amendments will be deemed
cured for all purposes of this Agreement). In order to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.8, Buyer must give notice of such
termination to Seller within 10 Business Days following receipt of such
supplemented or amended Schedules from Seller. In the event that Buyer
terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.8, such termination shall
be Buyers sole remedy hereunder, and Seller shall have no further liability
or obligation to Buyer.

_Employees and Employee Benefits_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) If Transferred Employees will constitute the majority of an
appropriate unit of a Non-Unionized Buyer Party, or if the Buyer Party is
otherwise required by Law to recognize the union local set forth on _Schedule
7.9(a)_ (the " _Local_ ") as the exclusive bargaining representative of the
bargaining unit set forth on _Schedule 7.9(a)_ that includes

  



  

40

  



  

  



  

Transferred Employees, then from and after the Effective Time, such Buyer
Party will recognize the applicable Local as the exclusive bargaining
representative of such Transferred Employees. In addition, if any Transferred
Employees to be employed by a Buyer Party will not be accreted into an
existing bargaining unit, such Buyer Party will negotiate and reach agreement
with the applicable Local on the terms and conditions of a new collective
bargaining agreement **** to be effective from and after the Effective Time
with respect to the appropriate bargaining unit of Transferred Employees (each
such agreement being referred to as a " _New CBA_ "). Should a Buyer Party
fail to successfully negotiate a New CBA with a Local pursuant to the
foregoing at least 20 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then at the
Closing, such Buyer Party will assume the existing Collective Bargaining
Agreement applicable to the bargaining unit represented by such Local. Buyer
agrees that (A) no later than 30 Business Days after the date hereof, Buyer
will notify Seller of all negotiations between any Buyer Party and any Local
that will be required by this Section 7.9(a), (B) upon request by Seller,
Buyer will notify Seller of the status of all negotiations between any Buyer
Party and any Local, (C) no later than 19 Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer will notify Seller of each New CBA that has been successfully
negotiated.

  

(b) No later than 20 **** Business Days prior to the Closing, one or
more Buyer Parties collectively will give Qualifying Offers of employment to
all Business Employees. Each such person who becomes employed by a Buyer Party
pursuant to this Section 7.9(b) is referred to herein as a " _Transferred
Employee_." For this purpose, a " _Qualifying Offer_ " means an offer for
employment effective upon the Closing at a level of base pay at least equal to
the Transferred Employees base pay in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and with a primary work location no more than 50 miles from the
Transferred Employees primary work location immediately prior to the Closing
Date. The severance compensation agreement listed on _Schedule 7.9 (b)_ will
be assumed by the Buyer Party delivering a Qualifying Offer to the Transferred
Employee that is party thereto.

  

(c) All offers of employment made by any Buyer Party pursuant to
Section 7.9(b) will be made in accordance with all applicable Laws, will be
conditioned only on the occurrence of the Closing, and will remain open for a
period expiring no earlier than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
Any such offer which is accepted before it expires will thereafter be
irrevocable, except for good cause. Following acceptance of such offers, Buyer
will provide written notice thereof to Seller and Seller will provide Buyer
with access to the Transferred Employee Records.

  

(d) The following will be applicable with respect to the Business
Employees, Current Retirees, and Other Plan Participants:

  

(i) From and after the Effective Time, the Transferred Employees
will accrue no additional benefits under any Benefit Plan or any other
employee benefit plan, policy, program, or arrangement of Seller or its
Affiliates.

  

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Buyer Party employing any
Transferred Employees will cause the Transferred Employees to be covered by
that

  



  

41

  



  

  



  

Buyer Partys benefit plans available to similarly situated employees of such
Buyer Party and, except as provided below, on the same terms and conditions as
are made available to such similarly situated employees. If a Buyer Party has
no similarly situated employees, such Buyer Party will cause the Transferred
Employees to be covered by benefit plans sponsored by such Buyer Party that
provide benefits that are comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits
provided to the Transferred Employees as of the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date. The commitments under this Section 7.9(d)(ii) require the
following:

  

(A) With respect to welfare benefit plans, each Buyer Party agrees to
waive or to cause the waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing conditions
and actively-at-work exclusions and waiting periods for the Transferred
Employees who were covered by a Benefit Plan providing similar benefits prior
to the Effective Time. With respect to the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs, all health care expenses incurred by any such employees or any
eligible dependent thereof, including any alternate recipient pursuant to
qualified medical child support orders, in the portion of the calendar year
preceding the Closing Date that were qualified to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket limit under any Seller
health care plans will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any
deductible or out-of-pocket limit under the health care plan of such Buyer
Party for such calendar year, provided that such Buyer Party will take such
expenses into account only to the extent that Seller first provides Buyer or
such Buyer Party with evidence of the year-to-date deductibles paid and out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees and eligible dependents under
Sellers benefit plans.

  

(B) With respect to service and seniority, each Buyer Party will
recognize the service and seniority of each of the Transferred Employees
recognized by Seller for all non-pension purposes, including the determination
of eligibility, the extent of service or seniority-related welfare benefits
such as vacation and sick pay benefits, and levels of benefits other than
pension benefits, including eligibility for and level of retiree health
benefits.

  

(C) The Parties will comply with the provisions set forth on _Exhibit
7.9(d)(ii)(C)_. For purposes thereof, Buyer will, prior to the Effective Time,
notify Seller of the Buyer Party that will assume the obligations set forth in
Exhibit 7.9(d)(ii)(C) relating to each Other Plan Participant.

  

(D) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall notify Seller of the
Buyer Party that will assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.9(d)(ii)(D) in relation to each Grandfathered Individual and member of the
West Plains Group; provided, however, that liabilities, obligations, and
responsibilities with respect to providing Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits to
each Grandfathered Individual will be assumed in their entirety by a Buyer
Party that provides Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits on the date hereof and at
the Effective Time.

  



  

42

  



  

  



  



  

(1) The Buyer Parties that provide post-retirement health and life
insurance benefits (" _Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits_ ") will assume all
liabilities, obligations, and responsibilities with respect to providing such
Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits to (i) the persons listed on _Schedule
7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1)_ and any Business Employee who retires between the date
hereof and the Closing Date (such listed persons and Business Employees, the "
_Current Retirees_ ") and their spouses and eligible dependents, and (ii) the
Business Employees who have, as of the Closing Date, satisfied the age and
service eligibility requirements for Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits under
the applicable Seller plans (the " _Grandfathered Active Employees_ " and,
together with the Current Retirees, the " _Grandfathered Individuals_ ") and
their spouses and eligible dependents. The Grandfathered Individuals as of the
date hereof are listed on _Schedule 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1)_. The Buyer Parties will
provide to the Current Retirees Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits that are
comparable to or more favorable in the aggregate than those Post-Retirement
Welfare Benefits provided to such Current Retirees immediately prior to the
Closing Date, under cost-sharing structures that are at least as favorable as
the cost-sharing structures in effect for and available to the Current
Retirees immediately prior to the Closing Date, for the applicable period set
forth on _Schedule 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1)_ (the " _Applicable Period_ "). The Buyer
Parties will provide to the Grandfathered Active Employees Post-Retirement
Welfare Benefits that are comparable to or more favorable in the aggregate
than those Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits that would have been available to
such Grandfathered Active Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date,
commencing at the time such Grandfathered Active Employees retire until the
later of (x) the date that is five years following the Closing Date, or (y)
the end of the Applicable Period stated on _Schedule 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1)_ under
cost-sharing structures that are at least as favorable as the cost-sharing
structures in effect for and available to the Grandfathered Active Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date (if such employees had retired
immediately prior to the Closing Date). For the avoidance of doubt, any
Grandfathered Active Employee who earns 1,000 hours of service with Seller in
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs will be given credit for an
additional year of service for purposes of Sellers Post-Retirement Welfare
Benefits. Following the periods set out above, Grandfathered Individuals, all
other Transferred Employees, and the spouses and eligible dependents of all of
the above will be covered by the post-retirement health and life insurance
plans available to similarly situated retirees, spouses, and eligible
dependents of the applicable Buyer Party. **** If a Buyer Party has no
similarly situated retirees, such Buyer Party will provide Grandfathered
Individuals employed or otherwise assumed by such Buyer Party and their
spouses and eligible dependents Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits that are
comparable in the aggregate to the Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits offered by
Seller as of the date immediately prior to the Closing Date and

  



  

43

  



  

  



  



  

will provide Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits to all other Transferred
Employees employed by such Buyer Party and their spouses and eligible
dependents that are comparable in the aggregate to the Post-Retirement Welfare
Benefits that are available to Transferred Employees who retire after January
1, 2005 under Sellers Benefit Plans.

  

(2) In lieu of the provisions of Section 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1) and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, those Current Retirees
and surviving spouses, and their spouses and eligible dependents, for whom
_Schedule 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1)_ lists the code "RBPAZE" or "RBPAZK" (the " _West
Plains Group_ ") will continue to participate in the Aquila, Inc. Employee
Health Care Plan (the " _Health Plan_ ") for the Applicable Period stated on
_Schedule 7.9(d)(ii)(D)(1)_. For so long as any member of the West Plains
Group participates in the Health Plan following Closing, Buyer will (or will
cause one or more other Buyer Parties to) reimburse Seller for the health,
dental, and vision care benefits or premiums paid by Seller to or on behalf
of, and any life insurance premiums paid by Seller on behalf of, all members
of the West Plains Group. Following the end of each calendar quarter, Seller
will submit to Buyer a statement of benefits and premiums paid by Seller to or
on behalf of the members of the West Plains Group during the previous calendar
quarter, and Buyer will (or will cause one or more other Buyer Parties to)
reimburse Seller in cash within 10 Business Days after receiving such
statement. Buyer will have the right to audit the benefits and premiums paid
by Seller to or on behalf of the members of the West Plains Group at Buyers
expense no more than once each calendar year.

  

(E) With respect to the Aquila, Inc. Retirement Investment Plan (the
" _Savings Plan_ "), Seller will vest Transferred Employees in their Savings
Plan account balances as of the Closing Date. Each Buyer Party will take all
actions necessary to cause such Buyer Partys 401(k) plan in which Transferred
Employees are eligible to participate (x) to recognize the years of service
that the Transferred Employees had in the Savings Plan for purposes of
determining such Transferred Employees eligibility to participate, vesting
under the vesting schedule of such Buyer partys 401(k) plan, attainment of
retirement dates, contribution levels, and, if applicable, eligibility for
optional forms of benefit payments, and (y) to accept direct rollovers of
Transferred Employees account balances in the Savings Plan, including
transfers of loan balances and related promissory notes, provided that such
loans would not be treated as taxable distributions at any time prior to such
transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Parties 401(k) plans shall
not be required to accept a direct or indirect rollover as of an account
balance that is in a form other than cash (except for loan balances and
related promissory notes).

  

(F) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller will transfer to
flexible spending plans maintained by each Buyer Party any balances standing
to the credit of Transferred Employees employed by such Buyer Party under
Sellers

  



  

44

  



  

  



  

flexible spending plan as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.
As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller will provide to Buyer a
list of those Transferred Employees that have participated in the health or
dependent care reimbursement accounts of Seller, together with (x) their
elections made prior to the Closing Date with respect to such account and (y)
balances standing to their credit as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. Within 45 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to
Seller all necessary information to enable Seller to transfer balances as
provided in this Section.

  

(G) The Buyer Parties will honor all vacation days accrued by the
Transferred Employees during the calendar year of the Closing and unused as of
the Closing.

  

(iii) With respect to severance benefits, each Buyer Party will provide
to any Transferred Employee who is not subject to a Collective Bargaining
Agreement and who is terminated by such Buyer Party (other than for cause)
prior to the date which is one year following the Closing Date, severance
benefits comparable to those provided by Seller under Sellers severance plans
and policies (other than any plans or policies with respect to stock options)
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any employee who is provided
severance benefits under this Section 7.9(d)(iii) may be required to execute a
release of claims against Seller and such Buyer Party, in such form as such
Buyer Party reasonably prescribes, as a condition for the receipt of such
benefits.

  

(iv) Seller will be responsible, with respect to the Business, for
performing and discharging all requirements under the WARN Act and under
applicable state and local laws and regulations for the notification of its
employees of any "employment loss" within the meaning of the WARN Act which
occurs at or prior to the Effective Time, except that the Buyer Parties will
be solely responsible for the foregoing if resulting from any breach by one or
more Buyer Parties of the obligations thereof under this Agreement.

  

(v) Seller will be responsible for providing COBRA Continuation
Coverage to any current and former Business Employees, or to any qualified
beneficiaries of such Business Employees, who become or became entitled to
COBRA Continuation Coverage on or before the Closing, including those for whom
the Closing occurs during their COBRA election period. The Buyer Parties are
responsible for extending and continuing to extend COBRA Continuation Coverage
to all Transferred Employees (and their qualified beneficiaries) who become
entitled to such COBRA Continuation Coverage following the Closing.

  

(vi) Seller or its Affiliates will pay or cause to be paid to all
Transferred Employees, all compensation (including any accrued vacation
carried over to the calendar year of the Closing from a previous calendar
year), workers compensation or other employment benefits to which they are
entitled under the terms of the applicable compensation or Seller benefit
plans or programs prior to the Effective Time. The Buyer Parties will pay to
each Transferred Employee all unpaid salary or other compensation or
employment benefits (but not including any compensation attributable to stock
options

  



  

45

  



  

  



  

granted by Seller) which have accrued to such employee from and after the
Effective Time, at such times as provided under the terms of the applicable
compensation or benefit programs.

  

(vii) Individuals who would otherwise be Transferred Employees but who on
the Closing Date are not actively at work due to a leave of absence covered by
the Family and Medical Leave Act or other authorized leave of absence,
including short-term or long-term disability, will be treated as Transferred
Employees on the date that they are able to return to work (provided that such
return to work occurs within the authorized period of their leaves (but no
more than six months) following the Closing Date) and perform the essential
functions of their jobs with or without reasonable accommodation.

  

(viii) The Buyer Parties will be responsible, with respect to the Business,
for performing and discharging all requirements under the WARN Act and under
applicable state and local laws and regulations for the notification of its
employees of any "employment loss" within the meaning of the WARN Act which
occurs following the Effective Time, or which occurs at the Effective Time if
(and only if) resulting from any breach by one or more Buyer Parties of the
obligations thereof under this Agreement.

  

(ix) The Buyer Parties will assume Sellers obligations as of the
Effective Time to pay nonqualified deferred compensation to the persons set
forth on _Schedule 7.9(d)(ix)_.

  

(x) Except for Section 7.9(d)(ii)(D), the provisions of this Section
7.9 are not, and will not be construed as being, for the benefit of any Person
other than the Parties hereto, and are not enforceable by any Persons
(including Transferred Employees, Current Retirees, and Other Plan
Participants) other than such Parties.

  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Buyer
Party may, subject to the requirements of this paragraph, delegate all of its
rights and obligations under this Section 7.9 (other than this paragraph) and
provisions of this Agreement relating to the enforcement thereof with respect
to any Transferred Employees and Grandfathered Individuals to any wholly owned
subsidiary of such Buyer Party, in which case references to "Buyer Party" in
this Section 7.9 and provisions of this Agreement relating to the enforcement
thereof will, with respect to such Transferred Employees and Grandfathered
Individuals, be deemed to be references to such subsidiary; provided, however,
that (i) such Buyer Party shall provide written notice to Seller within
thirty (30) days after the date hereof identifying such Transferred Employees
and Grandfathered Individuals; (ii) such subsidiary shall expressly agree in
writing to assume such rights and obligations in a writing that is expressly
enforceable by Seller; (iii) such Buyer Party shall not thereby be released
from its obligations under this Section 7.9 or any such other provision of
this Agreement and shall remain primarily liable for the performance thereof;
and (iv) benefits required to be provided to such Transferred Employees and
Grandfathered Individuals pursuant to Section 7.9(d) hereof shall be at least
comparable, in the aggregate, to those that would be required to be provided
if such Transferred Employees and Grandfathered Individuals were employed

  



  

46

  



  

  



  

or otherwise assumed directly by such Buyer Party. Nothing in this Section
7.9(d) shall prohibit a Buyer Party who delegates such rights and obligations
with respect to any Transferred Employees or Grandfathered Individuals from
directly employing or assuming obligations with respect to any other
Transferred Employees or Grandfathered Individuals.

_Eminent Domain; Casualty Loss_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) If, before the Closing Date, any of the Purchased Assets are
taken by eminent domain or condemnation, or are the subject of a pending or
(to Sellers Knowledge) contemplated taking which has not been consummated,
Seller will (i) notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact and (ii) at the
Closing assign to Buyer all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to
any proceeds or payments received, or to be received, in compensation for such
taking. Upon such assignment, such taking or takings, and their effects, will
be disregarded in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

  

(b) If, before the Closing Date, all or any material portion of the
Purchased Assets are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, Seller
will notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact. At the Closing, Seller
shall assign to Buyer all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to any
insurance recoveries received, or to be received, in compensation for damage
to or destruction of any Purchased Assets by fire or other casualty, less any
such amounts received, or to be received, to reimburse Seller for expenditures
incurred by Seller. If such damage or destruction, individually or in the
aggregate, would create a Material Adverse Effect, Buyer may terminate this
Agreement within 20 Business Days following Buyers receipt of such notice
from Seller unless (i) Seller notifies Buyer within such 20 Business Day
period of Sellers intention to cure such Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
Seller uses commercially reasonable efforts to effect such cure. Any such
termination by Buyer will be treated as a termination by the Parties pursuant
to Section 10.1(a).

  

(c) Seller and Buyer will use their commercially reasonable efforts
(without being required to make payment to any third party or to incur any
economic burden) to obtain from each holder of any Preferential Purchase Right
a written waiver of such Preferential Purchase Right if required with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "Applicable
Preferential Purchase Right"). Except as set forth in Section 8.1(d), **** if
Seller and Buyer cannot obtain a waiver of an Applicable Preferential Purchase
Right, Seller and Buyer will cooperate, using commercially reasonable efforts,
to provide for compliance with the terms of such Applicable Preferential
Purchase Right. In the event that any Purchased Asset remains subject to such
Applicable Preferential Purchase Right as of the Closing, in lieu of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price Seller will at the Closing assign to Buyer,
as a Purchased Asset, all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to all
rights of Seller with respect to such Applicable Preferential Purchase Right,
including proceeds received or to be received in respect to such Applicable
Preferential Purchase Right, and will assign to Buyer and Buyer will assume,
as Assumed Obligations, all obligations of Seller with respect to such
Applicable Preferential Purchase Right.

  



  

47

  



  

  



  



  

(d) Except to the extent expressly provided in this Section 7.10 or
Section 8.1(d), no condemnation or taking of, or exercise of a Preferential
Purchase Right set forth in _Schedule 5.8_ with respect to, any Purchased
Asset, nor any effects thereof (including any resulting termination of any
Franchise or other agreement principally related to such Purchased Asset), or
any supplements or amendments to any Schedules in relation thereto, will
constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred
a breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant of Seller, a Material
Adverse Effect, or a grounds for asserting a failure to satisfy any condition
to Closing under this Agreement.

  

(e) The Parties hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing
in this Agreement constitutes an offer or agreement to sell, transfer, dispose
of, purchase, assume, or acquire any asset subject to a Preferential Purchase
Right except upon the Closing following the satisfaction of all conditions to
Closing specified in this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor anything
herein or in connection herewith shall be deemed to obligate Seller to sell,
transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any Purchased Asset or Assumed
Obligation, to Buyer or any other Person, except upon the Closing following
the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing specified in this
Agreement.

  

7.11 _Transitional Use of Signage and Other Materials Incorporating
Seller s Name or other Logos_.

  

Buyer acknowledges that it will have no ongoing claim or rights in or to the
Seller Marks. Buyer will not use or permit the use of any Seller Marks, and
within 120 days following the Closing Date, Buyer will remove or cause the
removal of the Seller Marks from all signage or other items relating to or
used in the Business or the Purchased Assets.

        



  |  

7.12

  |  

_Litigation Support_. 

---|---|--- 
  

In the event and for so long as any Party is actively contesting or defending
against any third-party Claim in connection with (i) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date
involving Seller, the other Parties will cooperate with the contesting or
defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as
is reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the
sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the
contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article IX hereof).

        



  |  

7.13

  |  

_JEC Lease Buy-Out_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Prior to Closing, only if Buyer and Seller mutually agree,
Seller may (but will not be obligated to) exercise rights granted under
Section 6.1 and related provisions of the JEC Lease to purchase the JEC Leased
Assets (or, in lieu thereof, the JEC Lease Trust Interests) (any such purchase
being referred to as the " _JEC Lease Buy-Out_ "), and to

  



  

48

  



  

  



  

take any and all actions Seller and Buyer mutually agree are necessary or
appropriate in connection therewith, including:

        



  |  

(i)

  |  

negotiating and agreeing upon the JEC Lease Buy-Out Price; 

---|---|--- 
  

(ii) negotiating with the KCC and its staff, entering into any
agreement with the KCC or its staff, and consenting to the issuance of any
Order by the KCC, in any case on terms that are reasonably agreed by Buyer and
Seller, regarding or establishing the portion of the JEC Lease Buy-Out Price
that the owner of the Business will be permitted to recover in rates;

  

(iii) electing to assume and assuming any JEC Lease Indebtedness in
connection with the consummation of the JEC Lease Buy-Out;

  

(iv) amending or consenting to the amendment of the JEC Lease and
other JEC Lease Documents to extend any notice period applicable to a possible
JEC Lease Buy-Out, accelerate or extend the closing date of any JEC Lease Buy-
Out, or otherwise modify any procedural requirements applicable to the JEC
Lease Buy-Out;

  

(v) amending or consenting to the amendment of the JEC Lease and
other JEC Lease Documents to provide for the purchase of the JEC Lease Trust
Interests in lieu of the JEC Leased Assets; and

  

(vi) executing and delivering notices, certificates, and documents,
and taking other actions, in connection with any of the foregoing.

  

(b) In the event that the JEC Lease Buy-Out is consummated prior to
Closing, Seller will pay the JEC Lease Buy-Out Price (including, to the extent
Seller has elected to do so under the JEC Lease, assumption of the JEC Lease
Indebtedness), and at Closing, Buyer will assume such JEC Lease Indebtedness.

  

(c) Between the date hereof and prior to Closing, Seller will provide
to Buyer copies of all notices and material correspondence delivered or
received, and filings made, by Seller in connection with the JEC Lease Buy-
Out, reasonably promptly following the delivery, receipt, or filing thereof
and will otherwise keep Buyer reasonably informed concerning all matters
related to the JEC Lease Buy-Out. Buyer will cooperate with Seller and will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as may be
reasonably requested by Seller in connection with the JEC Lease Buy-Out.

  

(d) In the event that the JEC Lease Buy-Out has not been
consummated prior to Closing, at Closing Buyer will assume all of Sellers
then-existing rights and obligations, if any, with regard to the JEC Lease
Buy-Out and the JEC Lease Documents.

  

(e) Except to the extent expressly prohibited by this Section 7.13,
neither the exercise of rights with respect to or closing of, or failure to
exercise rights with respect to or close, the JEC Lease Buy-Out, nor any
matter relating thereto or arising therefrom, nor any effects of any of the
foregoing, nor any supplements or amendments to any Schedules to this
Agreement reflecting any of the foregoing, will constitute or be taken

  



  

49

  



  

  



  

into account in determining whether there shall have occurred a breach of any
representation, warranty, or covenant of Seller, a Material Adverse Effect, a
condition to Closing, or grounds for asserting a failure to satisfy any
condition to Closing under this Agreement.

        



  |  

7.14

  |  

_Notification of Customers_. 

---|---|--- 
  

As soon as practicable following the Closing, Seller and Buyer will cause to
be sent to customers of the Business a notice of the transfer of the customers
from Seller to Buyer (the " _Customer Notification_ "). The Customer
Notification will contain such information as is required by Law and approved
by Buyer and Seller, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

  

7.15 _Exclusivity_. As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement, and in consideration of the time and expense which Buyer has
devoted and will devote to the transactions contemplated hereby during the
period subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and until the earlier of
(a) the Closing Date or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article X, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives will (i) initiate, solicit, or accept any inquiry or proposal
with respect to a sale or other transfer of all or any substantial portion of
the Purchased Assets or the Business (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii)
discuss, negotiate or agree to any Acquisition Proposal with, or in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal disclose any information concerning the
Purchased Assets or the Business or afford access to the Business properties
or books and records to, any Person other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives, or (iii) facilitate in any manner any effort or attempt by
any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing; provided that none of the
foregoing shall apply to any transaction or proposed transaction involving any
merger, consolidation, or reorganization of Seller with or into, or a sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Seller to, any
Person, provided, however, that upon the consummation of any such transaction
such Person (or the surviving Person in the case of a merger, consolidation,
or similar transaction) assumes, expressly in writing or by operation of law,
all rights and obligations of Seller under this Agreement.

   

7.16 _Financing Commitment_. During the period subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement and until the earlier of (a) the Closing Date or
(b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article X, no Buyer
Party will amend, supplement, otherwise modify, or terminate the Financing
Commitment, or consent to or approve any of the foregoing, without in each
case the prior written consent of Seller, such consent of Seller not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Buyer Party will in good faith use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the financing contemplated by
the Financing Commitment, including using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain satisfaction of the conditions precedent to such financing. No Buyer
Party will, without the prior written consent of Seller, take any action
which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere
with or delay the satisfaction of any such condition or consummation of such
financing. Buyer shall immediately notify Seller of any termination of the

from other financing

  



  

50

  



  

  



  

sources financing adequate to pay the Purchase Price and any expenses incurred
by Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.2

  |  

_Indemnification_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Subject to Section 9.1 and Section 9.4 hereof, from and after the
Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer from and
against any and all Claims and Losses (each, an " _Indemnifiable Loss_ "),
asserted against or suffered by Buyer relating to, resulting from, or arising
out of (i) any breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement which by its terms is to be performed prior to or
at the Closing, (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach by Seller of the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii)
any breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement not covered by Section 9.2(a)(i), or (iv) the Excluded Liabilities.

  

(b) Subject to Section 9.1 and Section 9.4 hereof, from and after the
Closing, Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller from and
against any and all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against or suffered by
Seller relating to, resulting from, or arising out of (i) any breach by any
Buyer Party of any covenant or agreement of any Buyer Party contained in this
Agreement which by its terms is to be performed prior to the Closing, (ii) any
inaccuracy in or breach by any Buyer Party of the representations and
warranties of such Buyer Party contained in this Agreement, (iii) any breach
by any Buyer Party of any covenant or agreement of such Buyer Party contained
in this Agreement not covered by Section 9.2(b)(i), (iv) the Assumed
Obligations, or (v) any and

  



  

53

  



  

  



  

all liabilities and obligations associated with the ownership and operation of
the Purchased Assets and the Business from and after the Effective Time.

  

(c) Any Person entitled to receive indemnification under this
Agreement (an " _Indemnitee_ ") having a claim under these indemnification
provisions will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses,
including commercially reasonable efforts to recover all Losses from insurers
of such Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the
amount of any Indemnifiable Loss hereunder, and will not take any action
specifically excluding from any of its insurance policies any Indemnifiable
Losses if Losses of such type are otherwise covered by such policies. The
amount of any Indemnifiable Loss will be reduced (i) to the extent that
Indemnitee receives any insurance proceeds with respect to an Indemnifiable
Loss and (ii) to take into account any net Tax benefit recognized by the
Indemnitee arising from the recognition of the Indemnifiable Loss and any
payment actually received with respect to an Indemnifiable Loss.

        



  |  

9.3

  |  

_Indemnification Procedures_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If an Indemnitee receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Claim by any Person who is neither a Party to
this Agreement nor an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") for which the Indemnitee claims a right to indemnification hereunder
from the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnitee will
promptly give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying
Party. Such notice will describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail and will indicate the estimated amount, to the extent
practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that the Indemnitee claims it has
sustained or may sustain as a result of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, will have the right, upon
written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim while reserving its right to contest the issue of whether it is liable
to the Indemnitee for any indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

  

(b) _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a), the
Indemnifying Party will appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee for the defense of such Third Party Claim, will diligently pursue
such defense, and will keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed with respect to
such defense. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel, including permitting reasonable access to books, records, and
personnel, in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim (provided,
that any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Indemnitee in providing such
cooperation shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnitee will have
the right to participate in such defense, including appointing separate
counsel, but the costs of such participation shall be borne solely by the
Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will have full authority, in consultation
with the Indemnitee, to make all decisions and determine all actions to be
taken with respect to the defense and settlement of the Third Party Claim,
including the right to pay, compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of such
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense; provided, that any such
settlement will

  



  

54

  



  

  



  

be subject to the prior consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third
Party Claim, which the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and which
acceptance requires the consent of the Indemnitee pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party will give written notice to the
Indemnitee to that effect. If the Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm
offer within 10 days after its receipt of such notice, and such firm offer
involves only the payment of money, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim will be the amount of such
settlement offer, plus reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by the
Indemnitee up to the date of such notice for which the Indemnifying Party is
otherwise liable. In no event will the Indemnifying Party have authority to
agree to any relief binding on the Indemnitee other than the payment of money
damages by the Indemnifying Party unless agreed to by the Indemnitee.

  

(c) _Failure of Indemnifying Party to Assume Defense_. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with the terms hereof within 20 Business Days after the receipt of
notice thereof, the Indemnitee may elect to defend against the Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable expenses
of such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and other litigation
costs) to the extent the Indemnifying Party is otherwise obligated hereunder
to indemnify Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

(d) _Direct Losses_. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an
Indemnifiable Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct
Loss_ ") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof, stating the nature of such Loss in reasonable detail and
indicating the estimated amount, if practicable. The Indemnifying Party will
have a period of 20 Business Days within which to respond to such claim of a
Direct Loss. If the Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, or does not respond
within such period, the Indemnitee may seek enforcement of its rights to
indemnification under this Agreement. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to
respond under this Section 9.3(d) will not constitute an admission by the
Indemnifying Party with respect to the claim asserted.

  

(e) If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent
to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by
recovery, settlement, or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance
coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement, or payment by or
against any other Person, the amount of such reduction, less any costs,
expenses, or premiums incurred in connection therewith, will promptly be
repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any indemnity
payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such indemnity payment,
be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party in
respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the indemnity payment relates;
provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party is then in compliance with
its obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and
(ii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss, any
and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on
account of said indemnity payment will be subordinated to the Indemnitees
rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality or

  



  

55

  



  

  



  

effect of any other provision hereof, the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying
Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above described subrogation and subordination rights,
and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims at the direction of
the Indemnifying Party.

  

(f) A failure to give timely notice as provided in this Section 9.3
will affect the rights or obligations of a Party hereunder only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, the Party entitled to receive such notice
was actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no claim for indemnification made after expiration of the
applicable time periods set forth in this Article IX will be valid.

        



  |  

9.4

  |  

_Limitations on Indemnification_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) Buyer or Seller may assert a claim for indemnification under
Section 9.2(a)(ii) or Section 9.2(b)(ii), as the case may be, only to the
extent the Indemnitee gives notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party
prior to the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in Section
9.1. Any claims pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) must be
asserted within one year following the Closing Date. Any claim for
indemnification not made in accordance with Section 9.3 by Buyer or Seller on
or prior to the applicable date set, if any, forth in this Article IX, and the
other Partys indemnification obligations with respect thereto, will be
irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX: (i)
Seller will not have any indemnification obligations for Indemnifiable Losses
under Sections 9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(a)(ii) (A) for any individual item where the
Loss relating thereto is less than $25,000 and (B) in respect of each
individual item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than
$25,000, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds 1% of the
Purchase Price, and then only to the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no
event will the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller under Sections
9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(a)(ii) exceed 15% of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) the limitations set forth in Sections 9.4(b)(i) and 9.4(b)(ii)
will not apply to claims asserted by Buyer for breaches of Sections 5.1, 5.2,
5.3(a), 5.18, and 5.20, and (y) the aggregate indemnification to be paid by
Seller under Section 9.2(a)(ii) with respect to breaches of Sections 5.1, 5.2,
5.3(a), 5.18, and 5.20, will not exceed 50% of the Purchase Price, less any
other indemnification payments made by Seller pursuant to **** Sections
9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(a)(ii).

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX: (i) Buyer
will not have any indemnification obligations for Indemnifiable Losses under
Sections 9.2(b)(i) and 9.2(b)(ii) (A) for any individual item where the Loss
relating thereto is less than $25,000 and (B) in respect of each individual
item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than $25,000,
unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds 1% of the Purchase
Price, and then only to the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event will
the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Buyer under Sections 9.2(b)(i) and
9.2(b)(ii) exceed 15% of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) the limitations set forth in Sections 9.4(c)(i) and 9.4(c)(ii) will not
apply to claims asserted by

    



  

56

  



  

  



  

Seller for breaches of Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3(a), 6.5, and 6.6, and (y) the
aggregate indemnification to be paid by Buyer under Section 9.2(b)(ii) with
respect to breaches of Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3(a), 6.5, and 6.6 will not exceed
50% of the Purchase Price, less any other indemnification payments made by
Buyer pursuant to **** Sections 9.2(b)(i) and 9.2(b)(ii).

  

(d) No representation or warranty of any Party contained herein will
be deemed untrue or incorrect, and such Party will not be deemed to have
breached a representation, warranty, or covenant as a consequence of the
existence of any fact, circumstance, action, or event that is permitted to be
taken by such Party under the terms of this Agreement, or that is disclosed in
this Agreement, any Schedule, or Exhibit hereto, or any certificate or other
instrument delivered in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

(e) **Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, neither Seller nor any other Person is making any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Seller, the Business, the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Obligations or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and Seller disclaims any other representations or warranties,
whether made by Seller or its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents, or representatives, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS. Any claims Buyer may have for breach of
representation or warranty must be based solely on the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, except for Seller s representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement in favor of Buyer, each Buyer Party acknowledges and agrees
that none of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability to any Buyer Party or any other Person for, and
Seller hereby disclaims all liability and responsibility for, any
representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or information
made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to any Buyer Party or
any of Buyers Representatives, including any confidential memoranda
distributed on behalf of Seller relating to the Business, the Purchased
Assets, or the Assumed Obligations or other publications or data room
information provided to any Buyer Party or Buyers Representatives, or any
other document or information in any form provided to any Buyer Party or
Buyers Representatives in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets,
the assumption of the Assumed Obligations, and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any opinion, information, projection, or advice that may
have been or may be provided to a Buyer Party or Buyers Representatives by
any of Sellers Representatives). EACH BUYER PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT,
EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V, THE BUSINESS AND
THE PURCHASED ASSETS ARE BEING PURCHASED ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS, WITH
ALL FAULTS.**

  

(f) Seller shall have no liability to any Buyer Party or Affiliate
thereof, other than Buyer, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby, except that Seller shall
indemnify each Buyer Party for any

  



  

57

  



  

  



  

actual, direct monetary damages incurred by such Buyer Party as a result of
any breach by Seller of its representations and warranties made in Section
5.11, Section 5.12, or Section 5.20 hereof or of any of Sellers obligations
to such Buyer Party under Section 7.2(e), Section 7.9, or Section 7.12 hereof,
in each case subject to and in accordance with the procedures for and all
limitations (as to both time and amount) on indemnification by Seller set
forth in this Article IX; provided, however, that all Claims of all Buyer
Parties shall be aggregated for purposes of determining and applying any
limitations on the amount of any such indemnification.

  

9.5 _Applicability of Article IX_. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller and Buyer agree that the remedies and obligations under this Article IX
(other than the waiver of liability provided for in 9.4(f)) apply only
following the Closing, and that prior to the Closing or in the event that this
Agreement is terminated the Parties remedies will be determined by applicable
Law and the provisions of Article X, subject to Section 9.4(f).

  

9.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Buyer agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for federal, state, and local income Tax purposes.

  

9.7 _No Consequential Damages_. Except as provided in the following
sentence, notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement
or provided for under any applicable Law, from and after the Closing no Party
will, in any event, be liable to any other Party, either in contract or in
tort, for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive
damages of the other Party, including loss of future revenue, income, or
profits, diminution of value, or loss of business reputation or opportunity,
relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof or otherwise, whether or not
the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other Party in
advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such other Party. The
exclusion of consequential, incidental, indirect, special, and punitive
damages as set forth in the preceding sentence does not apply to any such
damages sought by third parties against Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
in connection with Losses that may be indemnified pursuant to this Article IX.

  

9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, from
and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or
inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement or any covenant or agreement to be performed hereunder, will
be indemnification in accordance with this Article IX and the remedies
provided for in Section 10.4. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and each
Buyer Party hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any and all other rights, claims, and causes of action (including rights of
contributions, if any) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement
(including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise
in the future, that it may have against the other arising under or based upon
any Law (including any such Law under or relating to environmental matters),
common law, or otherwise.

 **ARTICLE X**

  

 **TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES**

        



  |  

10.1

  |  

_Termination_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing
Date by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

  

(b) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller or Buyer if the
Closing has not occurred on or before 12 **** months following the date of
this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) will not be available to a
Party if any failure by such Party (or, in the case of Buyer, by any Buyer
Party) to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date.

  

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by either Seller or Buyer if (i)
any Required Regulatory Approval has been denied by the applicable
Governmental Entity and all appeals of such denial have been taken and have
been unsuccessful, or (ii) one or more courts of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or any State has issued an Order permanently restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and such Order has become
final and nonappealable.

  

(d) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if there has been a
breach by Seller of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by it in
this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Buyer to effect the Closing and such breach has not been cured
by Seller or waived by Buyer within 20 Business Days after all other
conditions to Closing have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied.
For the avoidance of doubt, supplements or amendments to Schedules pursuant to
Section 7.8 shall not be deemed a breach giving rise to a right to terminate
pursuant to this Section 10.1(d).

  

(e) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer in accordance with the
terms of Section 7.8.

  

(f) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if (i) there has been
a breach by any Buyer Party of any representation, warranty, or covenant made
by it in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition
to the obligations of Seller to effect the Closing and such breach has not
been cured by such Buyer Party or waived by Seller within 20 Business Days
after all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied or are capable of
being satisfied, or (ii) the Financing Commitment (or any replacement thereof
reasonably acceptable to Seller) has been terminated and a replacement
financing commitment upon terms reasonably acceptable to Seller has not been
obtained by Buyer or is not in full force and effect within 20 Business Days
following such termination of the Financing Commitment (or of any such
replacement thereof).

  



  

59

  



  

  



  



  

10.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either or both of Seller and Buyer pursuant to Section
10.1, written notice thereof will forthwith be given by the terminating Party
to such other Party and this Agreement will terminate and the transactions
contemplated hereby will be abandoned, without further action by any Party,
whereupon the liabilities of all of the Parties hereunder will terminate,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including Section
10.3).

        



  |  

10.3

  |  

_Remedies upon Termination_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) The obligations of the Parties under Articles I, X, and XI, and
Sections 7.2(b), 7.2(c), 7.2(d), 7.3, and 7.5 will survive the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1. In the event of any such termination,
each of the Parties shall be and remain liable for any breach of its
obligations under this Agreement prior to such termination, including
liability for all damages suffered or sustained by any other Party.

  

(b) Upon any termination of this Agreement, all filings, applications
and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent
practicable, will be withdrawn from the Governmental Entity or other Person to
which they were made.

  

10.4 _Specific Performance_. This Agreement is being entered into (i)
by Buyer as a strategic action in furthering Buyers business strategy, and
(ii) by Seller as part of a strategic corporate-wide restructuring process,
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will be a significant
contributing factor to the success of such process. The Parties acknowledge
that any failure to consummate the transactions provided for herein will
frustrate the Parties respective objectives in entering into this Agreement.
Accordingly, the Parties agree and stipulate that the Purchased Assets are
unique and that (x) any failure to consummate the transactions provided for in
this Agreement due to breach of this Agreement by any Party would result in
irreparable injury to the other Parties, (y) in the event of any such failure
to consummate such transactions it would be very difficult or impracticable to
determine monetary damages caused by such a breach, and (z) in any event,
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy for any such breach.
Therefore, the Parties expressly agree that in the event of breach of this
Agreement by any Party, any other Party, individually and without action by or
joinder of any other Party, will, in addition to any other rights and remedies
hereunder, have the right to enforce this Agreement by obtaining an order for
specific performance of the Parties obligations hereunder.

2.3 _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this Services
Agreement or Aquilas obligation to provide all or any of the Services, the
Parties will have no further obligations hereunder with respect to the
terminated Service or Services; provided, however, that notwithstanding such
termination (i) Buyer will remain liable to Aquila for all amounts payable in
respect of the terminated Services provided prior to the effective date of the
termination, and (ii) the provisions of Articles II, IV, V, and VII of this
Services Agreement will survive any such termination indefinitely.

COMPENSATION

  

3.1 _Fee for Services_. Buyer will compensate Aquila for the
Services in accordance with _Schedule 1.1_ and this Article III.

bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 5%.

  

3.3 _Sales and Use Taxes_. For state and local sales and use tax
purposes, Aquila and Buyer will cooperate in good faith to segregate amounts
payable under this Services Agreement into the following categories: (i)
taxable Services; (ii) non-taxable Services; and (iii) payments made by Aquila
merely as a purchasing agent for Buyer in procuring goods or services. Aquila
will collect from Buyer all state and local sales and use taxes in respect of
the Services and will timely remit such taxes to the appropriate state and
local tax authorities. Buyer will pay such taxes to Aquila monthly, or as
otherwise reasonably required by Aquila. Within 20 days

following the receipt by Aquila of notice thereof, Aquila will notify Buyer of
the commencement of any sales or use tax audit by a taxing authority which
involves any Services provided hereunder or any payments made by Aquila as
purchasing agent pursuant hereto. Thereafter, Buyer may, at its own expense,
participate in the defense of that audit to the extent related to any such
Services or payments. Buyer will be responsible for any additional taxes
imposed in respect of the Services, and all related interest, as a result of
any such sales or use tax audit.

  

ARTICLE IV

  

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

  

4.1 _Performance Standards_. Aquila will provide the Services in

for its own operations.

  

4.2 _DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES_ **. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH
HEREIN, AQUILA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR

Aquila and its directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any
and all Losses arising out of, or resulting from, the provision of the
Services by Aquila hereunder, other than Losses arising or resulting from
Aquilas gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  



  

4.4 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event will Aquila be liable to
Buyer for any lost profits, loss of data, loss of use, business interruption,
or other special, incidental, indirect, punitive, or consequential damages,
however caused, under any theory of liability, arising from Aquilas
performance of, or relating to, the Services or this Services Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE V

  

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES

  

The relationship of Aquila to Buyer under this Services Agreement is that of
an independent contractor, and Aquila will not be deemed an employee, partner,

employment-related costs, taxes, or benefits in respect of the provision of
the Services.

 _ **Determination of Purchase Price**_

  



  

A. The following principles (the " _Accounting Principles_ ") will
govern certain accounting matters provided for herein:

  



  

1. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts will be determined in accordance with GAAP and applicable FERC Accounting Rules. 

  



  

2. The amount of any item reflected in Sellers financial statements or in the attached _Exhibit 3.1.A_ , _Exhibit 3.1.B_ , or _Exhibit 3.1.C_ as of any specified time, including in any FERC Account, as determined in accordance with GAAP and the FERC Accounting Rules, is referred to as the " _Book Value_ " of such item as of such specified time. 

  



  

3. " _GAAP_ " means United States generally accepted accounting principles, applied on a consistent basis.

  



  

4. " _FERC Accounting Rules_ " means the requirements of FERC with respect to and in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts established by FERC.

  



  

5. All determinations and calculations will be made and performed in a manner to (a) avoid double counting of any item, to the extent that any such item is otherwise accounted for in such determination or calculation, and (b) give effect to the change in accounting policies described in note 1 to _Exhibit 3.1.C_. For purposes of computing the Adjustment Amount, any changes in applicable accounting rules, including the FERC Accounting Rules, following the date of this Agreement (other than the changes described in note 1 to _Exhibit 3.1.C_ ) will not be given effect for purposes of computing the Adjustment Amount to the extent that such changes would have the effect of changing any of the items included in Net Plant or the FERC Accounts in a manner that would cause the Adjustment Amount, if computed taking such changes into account, to be greater or lesser than the Adjustment Amount, as computed without taking such changes into account.

  



  

6. Certain account balances and other values will be determined as set forth below:

  



  

" _Base Net Plant Amount_ " equals the Net Plant as of June 30, 2005, which
the Parties stipulate is $186,987,000.

  



  

" _Extraordinary Expenditures_ " means any expenditures by Seller during the
period from the date hereof through the Effective Time incurred for the
purpose of repair, replacement, or addition to assets (other than expenditures
to the extent reflected as Net Plant or in any FERC Account or otherwise
recovered by Seller in rates prior to Closing by reason of preexisting
authorization or extraordinary relief) as a result of (i) damage resulting
from weather or other extraordinary or catastrophic occurrence; or (ii) the

  



  

82

  



  

  



  

imposition of any requirement by a Governmental Entity; provided, however,
that any expenditure (which, with respect to any matter referred to in clauses
(i) or (ii) of this definition, will be deemed to include all costs, expenses,
and payments incurred by Seller in respect of such matter (e.g, all costs
incurred due to a catastrophic storm), except to the extent reflected as Net
Plant or in any FERC Account or otherwise recovered by Seller in rates prior
to the Closing by reason of preexisting authorization or extraordinary relief)
of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this definition will be
deemed an Extraordinary Expenditure only if the amount of such expenditure in
excess of amounts thereof reflected as Net Plant or in any FERC Account or
otherwise recovered by Seller in rates prior to the Closing by reason of
preexisting authorization or extraordinary relief exceeds five percent of the
Extraordinary Expenditures Reference Amount, in which case the full amount of
such expenditure (from dollar one) in excess of amounts reflected as Net Plant
or in any FERC Account or otherwise recovered by Seller in rates prior to the
Closing by reason of preexisting authorization or extraordinary relief will be
deemed an Extraordinary Expenditure. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Extraordinary Expenditures will be reduced by the amount of any insurance
proceeds received by Seller in respect of the matter giving rise to the
Extraordinary Expenditure unless (and to the extent) such proceeds are
assigned to Buyer at Closing.

  



  

" _Extraordinary Expenditures Adjustment_ " means all Extraordinary
Expenditures, plus interest on each such expenditure at the Prime Rate from
the date of the expenditure until the Closing Date.

  



  

" _Extraordinary Expenditures Reference Amount_ " means the earnings before
interest and Income Taxes attributed to the Business after deducting all
corporate-level charges, determined in a manner consistent with Sellers
normal accounting practices, for the annual period ended December 31, 2004.

  



  

" _FERC Accounts_ " means the accounts listed on lines 13-35 and 42-51 of
_Exhibit 3.1.C_ maintained by Seller with respect to the Business in

" _Lease Buy-Out Amount_ " is the total amount paid or to be paid by Seller
pursuant to Section 7.4(d) of the Agreement in connection with the purchase of
leased assets to be included in the Purchased Assets. For purposes of
calculating the Purchase Price and the Adjustment Amount, the Book Value of
assets purchased pursuant to Section 7.4(d) will be excluded from Net Plant
and the FERC Accounts (even if the assets purchased would normally be
reflected as Net Plant or in one or more FERC Accounts following such
purchase).

  



  

" _Net Plant_ " means the Book Value of net plant of the Business, which is
comprised of the amounts listed on lines 3-7 of _Exhibit 3.1.C_.

  



  

" _Net Plant Adjustment_ " may be a positive or negative number, and means Net
Plant at Closing minus the Base Net Plant Amount.

  



  



  

83

  



  

  



  



  

" _Net Plant at Closing_ " will be the Net Plant, determined as of the
Effective Time.

  



        



  |  

B.

  |  

_Determination of the Adjustment Amount_ 

---|---|--- 
  



  

The Adjustment Amount will be the sum of the following amounts, in each case
determined as of the Effective Time: (i) the Net Plant Adjustment; (ii) the
net total Book Value of the FERC Accounts; (iii) the Lease Buy-Out Amount; and
(iv) the Extraordinary Expenditures Adjustment **.**

_Payments Unrelated to the Adjustment Amount_.

security (other than, after January 1, 2006, prepayments), as contemplated by
Section 7.4(f), (iii) any and all payments made or to be made under any
provision of Section 7.9, (iv) any and all proceeds or payments received or to
be received by a Party under any provision of Section 7.10, (v)
indemnification, as contemplated by Article IX.

An example of the computation of the Purchase Price (using financial
information for the Business as of June 30, 2005) is depicted on _Exhibit
3.1.A_ , _Exhibit 3.1.B_ , and _Exhibit 3.1.C_. Specifically, (i) _Exhibit

The following terms will govern the Parties obligations under Section
7.9(d)(ii)(C) of the Agreement (and any reference to _Section 7.9_ will be
deemed to include a reference to this Exhibit):

  



        

A.

  |  

_Post-Closing Spin-Off to Buyer Plan_ 

---|--- 
     

(1)

  |  

_Transfer of Liabilities_.

  |  


  

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Buyer Party will cause a Buyer
Pension Plan of such Buyer Party to accept all liabilities for benefits under
the Seller Pension Plan that would have been paid or payable (but for the
transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Paragraph A) to or with
respect to the Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants (as defined
below) employed or otherwise assumed by such Buyer Party, and such Buyer Party
will become with respect to each such Transferred Employee and Other Plan
Participant responsible for all benefits due under the Seller Pension Plan.
Seller will not take any action to fully vest the Business Employees in their
accrued benefits under the Seller Pension Plan. No Buyer Party will amend any
Buyer Pension Plan of such Buyer Party, or permit such Buyer Pension Plan to
be amended, to eliminate any benefit accrued as of the Effective Time, whether
or not vested, with respect to which liabilities are transferred pursuant to
this Paragraph A **.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Seller Pension Plan will continue to make all benefit payments to
Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants due under the Seller Pension
Plan until both the Initial Transfer Amount and the True-Up Amount have been
transferred to the respective Buyer Pension Plan. " _Other Plan Participants_
" mean any individuals (x) who have an accrued benefit under the Seller
Pension Plan but who are not actively employed by Seller on the Closing Date,
or whose employment is terminated by Seller on the Closing Date, and (y) whose
employment was principally associated with the Business. The Other Plan
Participants are set forth on _Schedule 7.9(d)(ii)-A_ , as the same is
amended by Seller on the Closing Date.

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller will deliver
to Buyer a list reflecting each Transferred Employees date of birth, service
and compensation under the Seller Pension Plan, each Transferred Employees
and Other Plan Participants accrued benefit thereunder as of the Closing
Date, and a copy of each pending or final domestic relations order affecting
the benefit of any Transferred Employee or Other Plan Participant.

        

(2)

  |  

_Transfer of Assets_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) Not later than 10 days after the Closing, Seller will direct its
actuary to determine the amount of assets allocable to the benefits **** with
respect to the Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants employed or
otherwise assumed by each Buyer Party in the Seller Pension Plan based on
section 4044 of ERISA, and in compliance with the safe harbor assumptions and
other requirements of section 414(l) of the Code (the " _Section 4044 Amount_
"). The Section 4044 Amount will be subject to review by Buyers actuary for
the purpose of confirming that the Section 4044 Amount was calculated in
accordance with this Paragraph A(2)(a).

  



  

88

  



  

  



  



  

(b) In accordance with the procedures set forth in this Paragraph
A(2)(b), Seller will cause cash (or other assets as Seller and Buyer mutually
agree) equal to the Section 4044 Amount to be transferred to the trust
established by each applicable Buyer Party as part of its Buyer Pension Plan
(the " _Buyer Pension Plan Trust_ "). On the Initial Transfer Date, Seller
will cause the trust which is a part of the Seller Pension Plan (the " _Seller
Pension Plan Trust_ ") to make a transfer of cash or other assets equal to the
Initial Transfer Amount to the applicable Buyer Pension Plan Trust. The "
_Initial Transfer Date_ " is the date that is five Business Days after the
requirements of Paragraphs A(2)(d) and A(2)(e) have been met. The " _Initial
Transfer Amount_ " means, for each Buyer Party, 75% of a good faith estimate
of the Section 4044 Amount applicable to such Buyer Party (as shall be
mutually agreed upon by Sellers actuary and Buyers actuary not less than 10
days prior to the Initial Transfer Date). As soon as practicable after the
Section 4044 Amount is determined in accordance with the requirements of
Paragraph A(2)(a) (the " _True-Up Date_ "), and in no event more than 60 days
after such final determination, the True-Up Amount shall be transferred as
provided below. If the Section 4044 Amount for any Buyer Party is greater than
the Reduction Amount for such Buyer Party, then Seller will cause a transfer
in cash (or other assets as Seller and Buyer mutually agree) equal to the
True-Up Amount to be made from the Seller Pension Plan Trust to such Buyer
Partys Buyer Pension Plan Trust. If the Reduction Amount for any Buyer Party
is greater than the Section 4044 Amount for such Buyer Party, then such Buyer
Party will cause a transfer in cash (or other assets as Seller and Buyer
mutually agree) equal to the True-Up Amount to be made from such Buyer Partys
Buyer Pension Plan Trust to the Seller Pension Plan Trust. The " _True-Up
Amount_ ," if any, for any Buyer Party means the difference between the
Section 4044 Amount for such Buyer Party, adjusted for interest pursuant to
Paragraph A(2)(c), and the Reduction Amount for such Buyer Party, adjusted for
interest pursuant to Paragraph A(2)(c). The " _Reduction Amount_ " for any
Buyer Party equals the sum of (x) the Initial Transfer Amount for such Buyer
Party, plus (y) benefit payments made by the Seller Pension Plan after the
Effective Time to any Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants that
are employed or otherwise assumed by such Buyer Party.

  

(c) For purposes of Paragraph A(2)(b), (x) the Section 4044 Amount
will be increased by interest from the Closing Date through the True-Up Date,
and (y) interest on each payment that is included in the Reduction Amount will
be computed, and added to the Reduction Amount, from the date of such payment
through the True-Up Date. All interest will be compounded daily, and computed
at the Prime Rate as of the Closing Date.

  

(d) In connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities
pursuant to this Section, Seller will provide to Buyer, and Buyer will provide
to Seller, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the receiving Party that the
Seller Pension Plan and each Buyer Pension Plan, respectively, is or continues
to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code and is in compliance with the
funding requirements of section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code.

  

(e) In connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities
pursuant to Paragraph A, Seller and each Buyer Party will cooperate with each
other in making all appropriate filings required by the Code or ERISA, and the
transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Section will not take
place until after the expiration of the 30-day period following the filing of
any required notices with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section
6058(b) of the Code.

  



  

89

  



  

  



  



        

(3)

  |  

_Benefits_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) The benefit provided by each Buyer Pension Plan to each
Transferred Employee who becomes a participant in such Buyer Pension Plan will
be at least equal to (x) the benefits accrued by such Transferred Employee
under the Seller Pension Plan on the Closing Date, computed by taking into
account the compensation credited to such Transferred Employee by Seller with
respect to periods prior to the Closing Date and service credited to such
Transferred Employee with Seller and any Buyer Party (in the case of service
with a Buyer Party, such service will be taken into account only for the
purpose of vesting and early retirement subsidies), plus (y) such Transferred
Employees benefit determined under the terms of the applicable Buyer Pension
Plan, as it may be amended from time to time, taking into account the
Transferred Employees service and compensation earned with a Buyer Party,
except that service credited by Seller will be taken into account for purposes
of eligibility, vesting, and early retirement subsidies.

  

(b) Notwithstanding Paragraph (3)(a) above, any Transferred Employee
who is at least age 55 as of the Closing Date will be entitled to a benefit at
retirement under the applicable Buyer Pension Plan at least equal to the
benefit such Transferred Employee would have received had such Transferred
Employee continued to participate in the Seller Pension Plan from the Closing
Date until the earlier of (x) such Transferred Employees actual retirement
date or (y) age 62.

        

B.

  |  

_Option to Transfer Assets to New Pension Plan_. 

---|--- 
  

(1) Notwithstanding Paragraph A, at Sellers option and with the
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, Seller may
elect to transfer prior to Closing the assets and liabilities for accrued
benefits, whether or not vested, that would have been paid or payable (but for
this Paragraph B) to or with respect to the Business Employees and Other Plan
Participants to a new pension plan (" _New Pension Plan_ ") to be established
by Seller. Seller will not take any action to fully vest the Business
Employees in their accrued benefits in the New Pension Plan. Buyer will not
amend the New Pension Plan, or permit the New Pension Plan to be amended, to
eliminate any benefit accrued as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested,
with respect to which liabilities are transferred pursuant to this Paragraph
B **.** The New Pension Plan will be a defined benefit pension plan qualified
under section 401(a) of the Code and will be identical to the Seller Pension
Plan with respect to the Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants and
provide a future rate of benefit accrual equal to the future rate of benefit
accrual provided under the Seller Pension Plan.

  

(2) In the event that Seller elects to spin off assets and
liabilities prior to Closing to a New Pension Plan, Seller will cause its
actuary to determine the amount of assets allocable to the accrued benefits
with respect to the Business Employees and Other Plan Participants in the
Seller Pension Plan based on section 4044 of ERISA and in compliance with the
safe harbor assumptions and other requirements of Section 414(e) of the Code
(the " _New Plan Section 4044 Amount_ ") as of the effective date of the
transfer of assets and liabilities to the New Pension Plan pursuant to
Paragraph B(1) (the " _Spin-Off Date_ "). The New Plan Section 4044 Amount
will be subject to review by Buyers actuary for the purpose of confirming
that the New Plan Section 4044 Amount was calculated in accordance with this
Section B(2). Interest from the date of

  



  

90

  



  

  



  

determination of the New Plan Section 4044 Amount to the date of the transfer
of assets to the New Pension Plan will be compounded daily, and computed at
the Prime Rate as of the Spin-Off Date.

  

(3) As soon as practicable after the final determination of the New
Plan Section 4044 Amount for the New Pension Plan is made, Seller will cause
the Seller Pension Plan to transfer cash or other assets equal to the New Plan
Section 4044 Amount, less any benefit payments made by the Seller Pension Plan
to Business Employees and Other Plan Participants from the Spin-Off Date to
the date of transfer of assets, to the New Pension Plan. From and after such
date, the New Pension Plan will be solely responsible for all benefits due to
Business Employees and Other Plan Participants under the Seller Pension Plan,
whether arising prior to, or after, the Closing Date.

  

(4) Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume sponsorship
of the New Pension Plan. Seller will provide to Buyer evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer that the New Pension Plan is qualified under section
401(a) of the Code and is in compliance with the funding requirements of
section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code.

  

(5) In connection with the change in sponsorship of the New Pension
Plan, Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other in making all
appropriate filings required by the Code or ERISA. 

        

(6)

  |  

_Benefits_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) The benefit provided by each Buyer Party to each Transferred
Employee who is a participant in a pension plan sponsored by such Buyer Party
following the Closing will be at least equal to (x) the benefits accrued by
such Transferred Employee under the New Pension Plan on the Closing Date,
computed by taking into account the service credited to such Transferred
Employee with Seller and any Buyer Party (in the case of service with a Buyer
Party, such service will be taken into account only for the purpose of vesting
and early retirement subsidies), plus (y) such Transferred Employees benefit
determined under the terms of the pension plan sponsored by such Buyer Party,
as it may be amended from time to time, taking into account the Transferred
Employees service and compensation earned with any Buyer Party, except that
service credited by Seller will be taken into account for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and eligibility for early retirement subsidies.

  

(b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (6)(a) above, any Transferred
Employee who is at least age 55 as of the Closing Date will be entitled to a
benefit at retirement under the applicable Buyer Pension Plan at least equal
to the benefit such Transferred Employee would have received had such
Transferred Employee continued to participate in the Seller Pension Plan from
the Spin-Off Date until the earlier of (x) such Transferred Employees actual
retirement date or (y) age 62.

(1) For purposes of this Section, the term " _Accrued Liability_ "
means the present value of the accrued benefit, as of the Effective Time, of
each Transferred Employee and each Other Plan Participant, determined on an
"accumulated benefit obligation" basis using the interest and other
assumptions and methods used by Sellers actuary on the measurement date most
recently

preceding the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards 132; provided that if the interest rate actually used by
Sellers actuary on such measurement date was less than six percent, then the
interest rate to be used for purposes of this paragraph C(1) will be six
percent. The interest rate and other assumptions and methods to be used
pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to herein as the " _SFAS 132
Assumptions_." Sellers actuary will determine the Accrued Liability in
accordance with its normal procedures and practices in preparing Sellers
actuarial report and such determination will be reviewed by the actuary for
Buyer. In the event of disagreement between them, they will appoint a third
actuary from a nationally recognized actuarial firm to resolve their
differences (the costs of the third actuary will be shared equally by Seller
and Buyer). The third actuarys determination of any dispute will be final. In
reaching such resolution, the third actuary will consider only the issues of
disagreement between the first two actuaries, it being understood that the
third actuary will not be retained to conduct its own independent review but
rather will be retained to resolve specific differences between Buyers
actuary and Sellers actuary. The actuarial assumptions and methods used by
Sellers actuary in determining the Accrued Liability will not be subject to
dispute unless such assumptions and methods are inconsistent with the SFAS 132
Assumptions.

  

(2) Following the Closing, if Seller elected to establish the New
Pension Plan prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer will compare the New Plan
Section 4044 Amount and the Accrued Liabilities. If the Accrued Liabilities
exceed the New Plan Section 4044 Amount, Seller will pay to the Buyer Parties,
in the respective amounts as determined by the Buyer Parties and as directed
by Buyer, the difference, in cash, within five Business Days of the
determination. If the New Plan Section 4044 Amount exceeds the Accrued
Liabilities, Buyer will (or will cause one or more Buyer Parties to) pay to
Seller the difference, in cash, within five Business Days of the
determination. If Seller did not elect to establish the New Pension Plan prior
to Closing, Seller and Buyer will compare the Section 4044 Amount and the
Accrued Liabilities. If the Accrued Liabilities exceed the Section 4044
Amount, Seller will pay to the Buyer Parties, in the respective amounts as
determined by the Buyer Parties and as directed by Buyer, the difference, in
cash, within five Business Days of the determination. If the Section 4044
Amount exceeds the Accrued Liabilities, Buyer will (or will cause one or more
Buyer Parties to) pay to Seller the difference, in cash, within five Business
Days of the determination.
