     | 7.1 | _Closing Working Capital Amount._ 
---|---|--- 

(a) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare, with the assistance of the Business employees, and deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth Sellers calculation of the Closing Working Capital
Amount (the "Statement of Net Working Capital"). The Statement of Net Working
Capital shall be prepared in accordance with the principles, procedures and
methodologies set forth on _Exhibit 7.1(a)_ (the "Applicable Accounting
Principles").

(b) Within fifteen (15) calendar days after delivery of the Statement of Net
Working Capital (the "Objection Period"), Buyer shall notify Seller in
writing of any objections to the calculations contained therein, specifying in
reasonable detail each objection and the basis for each objection (an
"Objection Notice"). Buyer and Seller shall have no right to dispute the
principles, procedures and methodologies used in the preparation of the
Statement of Net Working Capital so long as the principles, procedures and
methodologies used are consistent with the Applicable Accounting Principles.
If Buyer fails to deliver an Objection Notice to Seller within the Objection
Period, the Statement of Net Working Capital, and Sellers calculation of the
Closing Working Capital Amount set forth therein, shall be deemed final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If Buyer delivers an
Objection Notice to Seller within the Objection Period, Buyer and Seller shall
use good faith efforts to resolve the disputed items during the thirty (30)
calendar day period after the Objection Notice has been delivered to Seller
(or within such extended time period as is mutually agreed by the parties).
Any disputed items resolved in writing between Buyer and Seller within
such thirty (30) calendar day period shall be final and binding with respect
to such items. Any items which Buyer and Seller are unable to so resolve shall
be submitted, in writing, as soon as practicable for final determination
to PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "Arbitrator"), along with any supporting data
and analysis. The Arbitrator shall make a written determination as to each
issue remaining in dispute and the amount of the Closing Working Capital
Amount and the effect thereof on the Purchase Price, which determination of
the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties for all purposes
hereunder. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the Arbitrator that it reached such determination in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.1(b). Buyer and Seller shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within thirty (30)



 

18 calendar days following the submission thereof. The Arbitrator shall be
authorized to resolve only those issues remaining in dispute between the
parties submitted to it in accordance with this Section 7.1(b) by selecting,
as to each such issue, either Sellers or Buyers proposed resolution of such
issue. Buyer and Seller agree that judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Arbitrator in any court referred to in Section 20.6. The
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne by the parties in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the issues resolved by the Arbitrator,
which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based
on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be
determined by the Arbitrator at the time the Arbitrator renders
its determination on the merits of the matters submitted thereto.

(c) Promptly following the date that Seller and Buyer reach agreement upon
the disputed items pursuant to Section 7.1(b), or, if applicable, the date of
the final determination of the Arbitrator of the disputed items pursuant to
Section 7.1(b), Seller shall incorporate such resolution into the Statement
of Net Working Capital and deliver the revised Statement of Net Working
Capital to Buyer within ten (10) calendar days after the resolution of the
disputed items. The Statement of Net Working Capital as revised pursuant to
the terms of this Section 7.1(c), and the adjusted Closing Working Capital
Amount set forth therein, shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder.

(d) Buyer shall provide Seller and Sellers agents and representatives with
access during normal working hours to the Business employees, Facilities,
books, records and other supporting information and documents as requested by
Seller in order to prepare and complete the Statement of Net Working Capital,
the Closing Working Capital Amount and the calculations contained therein.



     | 7.2 | _Settlement of Purchase Price._ On the second (2nd)
business day following (i) the date Seller delivers the revised Statement of
Net Working Capital to Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(c), or (ii) the
expiration of the Objection Period if Buyer fails to deliver an Objection
Notice in accordance with Section 7.1(b) (the "Settlement Date"), Buyer shall
remit to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller as Sellers designee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the amount by which the Purchase Price
exceeds the sum of the Deposit and the Closing Payment, plus 
---|---|--- 


 

19 interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at six percent
(6%) per annum (the "Prevailing Rate"), or in the event the sum of the
Deposit and the Closing Payment exceeds the Purchase Price, Seller shall remit
to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of such
overpayment, plus interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at the Prevailing Rate. The procedures set forth in this Section 7
shall be the sole remedy for any disputes with respect to matters set forth in
the Statement of Net Working Capital (and the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital Amount related thereto).

     | 8.1 | _General._ As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall offer

Buyers normal drug and other pre-employment screening policies. For purposes
of this Agreement, Business Employees shall include employees absent from

permitted absences ("Short-term Leave Employees"). Those Business Employees
accepting Buyers offer of employment are hereinafter referred to as "Hired
Employees". In addition, any Business Employees who, as of the Effective Time,
either (i) are receiving long-term disability benefits under a long-term
disability plan of Seller or its Affiliates, or (ii) have been approved for
receipt of long-term disability benefits under such a plan ("Long-term Leave

responsibility for, and Buyer shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and
hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from, any and all liabilities,

employees. Buyer shall maintain such wages, salaries and benefits for the
Hired Employees who are non-union employees for a minimum of one year
following the Closing Date.

Employees are entitled as of the Effective Time, but only to the extent

entitled as of the Effective Time.

group health plan continuation coverages pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code, and Sections 601-609 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), for all Business Employees and their eligible
dependents; provided, however, that Buyer shall be responsible for providing
such coverages to Hired Employees and their eligible dependents who become
entitled to such coverages on account of "qualifying events" that occur after
the Effective Time or as a result of the transactions contemplated herein. 
---|---|--- 


     | 8.4 | _Severance._ Buyer shall provide severance benefits to
Hired Employees who are non-union employees not subject to a Retention
Agreement and who are terminated by Buyer without cause (as reasonably
determined by Buyer, it being understood that "cause" may include termination
of employment for tardiness, absenteeism, poor performance or violation of
Buyers policies) within the twelve (12) month period following Closing in
accordance with the severance benefits described on _Exhibit 8.4_ , and, for
purposes of calculating such severance benefits, Buyer shall give credit for
prior periods of service with Seller or its Affiliates in accordance with
Section 8.8. Hired Employees (not subject to a Retention Agreement) severed by
Buyer after such twelve (12) month period will receive severance benefits (if
any) as determined by Buyer. During the severance period of any Retention
Agreement, the applicable Hired Employee party thereto shall be entitled only
to the severance benefits (if any) set forth therein; after such period, such
Hired Employee will receive those severance benefits as determined by Buyer.

contributions shall be made to the Seller 401(k) Plans for the benefit of the
Business Employees and Seller and such plans will remain responsible for the
payment of benefits to the Business Employees under such plans. As of the
Closing Date, the interests of the Hired Employees in the Seller 401(k) Plans
shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested and shall be fully nonforfeitable.
Buyer shall establish or designate a defined contribution plan that is
qualified under Code Section 401(a) (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). A Hired
Employee who receives, or is entitled to receive, a distribution from a
Seller 401(k) Plan may roll over the distribution to the Buyer 401(k) Plan if
(i) the plan administrator of the applicable Seller 401(k) Plan certifies that
such amount is an "eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in
Code Section 402(f)), (ii) the rollover represents one hundred percent (100%)
of the Hired Employees interest in the Seller 401(k) Plan, and (iii) the
rollover is made in cash or cash and the promissory note representing
the Hired Employees outstanding participant loan under the Seller 401(k)
Plan; provided, however, that the Buyer 401(k) Plan shall not be required to
accept a rollover if the Hired Employee has failed to make any payment then
due on a participant loan.

Employees currently participate in welfare benefit plans and programs of
Seller or its Affiliates, including medical and workers compensation plans
and programs. As of the Closing Date, the Business Employees shall cease to
participate in such welfare benefit plans (other than rights to continued
coverage under COBRA) and programs and, subject to Sections 8.9 and 8.10
below, Seller and such plans will be responsible for the payment of benefits
to the Business Employees under such plans. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.8 | _Buyer Plans._ Buyers benefit plans shall recognize each
Hired Employees prior periods of service or seniority with Seller and its
Affiliates (and, to the extent recognized by the benefit plans of Seller or
its Affiliates, their respective predecessors) for purposes of benefit
eligibility and vesting under any benefit 
---|---|--- 



 

23 plan or program or compensation arrangements provided to such Hired Employees
after the Effective Time. In addition, Buyer shall waive pre-existing
condition requirements, evidence-of-insurability provisions, waiting-period
requirements and all other similar provisions under any benefit plan or
program or compensation arrangements provided to the Hired Employees after
the Effective Time. Buyer shall also apply toward any deductible requirements
and out-of-pocket maximum limits under its employee welfare benefit plans, any
amounts paid by each Hired Employee prior to Closing under welfare benefit
plans during the current plan year.

this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against, any liability that
arises under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C.

qualified under Code Section 125 ("Sellers 125 Plan") that includes flexible

as to enforceability, to general principles of equity;



     | (c) | Neither Seller nor, to Sellers knowledge, any other party

than Buyer and its Affiliates) the non-payment of which is or could become a
Lien upon, or otherwise could adversely affect in any material respect, any
of the Assets or the use thereof or could cause Buyer to incur any liability,
other than for any Taxes included in the Permitted Liens. None of the Assets

or subject to a "safe harbor lease" under Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended before the Tax Reform Act of 1984. Seller is not and

the Contracts for periods from and after the Effective Time of Closing.



     | 9.11 | _Intellectual Property._ Seller or its Affiliates own or

of any Liens except Permitted Liens, all material Intellectual Property Rights
currently used to conduct the Business as now operated by Seller. Without
limitation to the foregoing, Seller or its Affiliates own the Trademarks, and
the Trademarks are the only registered trademarks used in the Business. The
use of the Intellectual Property by the Business does not infringe upon or
otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights of others, and, to the
knowledge of Seller, no third party is challenging, infringing on or otherwise
violating any right of Seller or its Affiliates with respect to the
Intellectual Property. Seller has not received any written notice and
otherwise has no knowledge of any pending claim, order or proceeding with
respect to any of the Intellectual Property and to Sellers knowledge no
Intellectual Property is being used or enforced in a manner that will result
in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual
Property. For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property Right" means
any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent or trade secret (including any
registrations or applications for registration of any of the foregoing).
_Exhibit 9.11_ hereto sets forth a true and correct list of all issued and/or
pending patent applications owned by 
---|---|--- 



 

32 the Company and used in the Business, and Seller or an affiliate thereof
possesses ownership or will possess ownership as of and on the Closing Date
of all the patents and applications listed in Exhibit 9.11, including all
continuations, continuations-in-part, parents, divisions, reissues,
reexaminations, extensions and foreign counterparts thereof. The current use
of the patents and applications on _Exhibit 9.11_ by Seller and its affiliates
does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, neither
Seller, nor any affiliate thereof, has received written notice
of infringement upon or conflict with respect to intellectual property rights
of others and neither Seller, nor any affiliate thereof, has received any
written notice challenging or questioning the validity or effectiveness of any
license or agreement held by Seller or any affiliate thereof with respect to
the patents on _Exhibit 9.11_ and used in the operation of the Business,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse

Assets and Contracts and, to Sellers knowledge, there are no lawsuits,

citations or actions of any kind proposed or threatened against Seller (i)
with respect to the Business, the Facilities, the Assets or the Contracts, or
(ii) that seeks restraint, prohibition, damages or other relief in connection
with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. There are no orders, decrees, judgments or agreements with any court
or governmental authority to which Seller is a party and by which the
Business, the Facilities, the Assets or the Contracts are bound. No event has
occurred or circumstances exist that are reasonably likely to give rise to, or
serve as a basis for, the commencement of any such proceedings. The conduct of
the Business and Sellers use of the Assets and Contracts does not violate
or conflict, and has not violated or conflicted, with any applicable law, nor
has Seller received any written notice from any governmental authority or any
other third party regarding (a) any actual, alleged, possible or potential
violation of, or failure to comply with any applicable

are no other Permits required for the conduct of the Business, the operation
of the Facilities or the use of the Owned Real Estate. With respect to Permits

with past practice. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Seller shall not dispose of or permit to lapse any rights to

     | (g) | Seller shall not incur or assume any indebtedness for

---|---|--- 



     | 11.1.2 | _Access to Information._ During the period from the date
hereof until the Closing Date, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates and

Matters._ As soon as practicable following the date hereof (and in all events,
no later than five (5) business days following the date hereof), each of
Buyer and Seller shall file all requisite documents and notifications required
under the HSR Act, it being understood that the parties shall not request

economic/econometric analysis obtained by the parties in connection
with obtaining approval of the transactions contemplated herein under the HSR
Act. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be

commercially reasonable agreements as may be necessary to obtain timely
governmental or regulatory approvals and to take such further commercially
reasonable action in connection therewith as may be reasonably necessary;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall require any of Buyer,
Seller or their respective Affiliates to sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of or conduct their business in a specified manner, or agree to sell,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a
specified manner, 
---|---|---

exclusively retains, and Buyer acknowledges that it shall not acquire, any
right, title or interest in or to the trade names "ConAgra", "ConAgra Foods
Packaged Foods Company, Inc." and "ConAgra Foods, Inc.", any derivations
thereof, or any logos or trademarks related thereto or any other name,
trademark or logo not included in the Intellectual Property (the "Names").
Buyer agrees that promptly after the Effective Time it shall discontinue the
use of any stationery, letterhead, preprinted forms, advertising or other
media that references or uses the Names; provided, however, that Buyer shall
have the right to sell the finished goods and to use the packaging materials
for the sale of finished goods for which such packaging materials have
historically been used, until the earlier of six (6) months after the Closing
Date or the date that all of the Inventory has been sold or used. Within
fifteen (15) days after Closing, Buyer agrees that it shall remove all
references to the Names from any websites used by the Business. Buyer further
agrees that as soon as practicable, but in all events within thirty (30) days
after Closing, it shall remove all signage which refers to Seller or its
Affiliates, and take all such other action as may be necessary to disassociate
Seller with the operations of the Business after Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.4 | _Insurance Matters._ Buyer acknowledges that the Business
and Assets are covered by certain insurance policies and insurable risk
programs which have been made available by Seller or its Affiliates. As of
the Effective Time, such coverages shall no longer apply, Buyer shall have no
rights with respect to such coverages, policies or programs, and Buyer will be
responsible for implementing its own insurance policies and programs in
respect to the Business and the Assets. All such policies and programs, and
all rights and claims relating thereto, shall be retained by Seller and its
Affiliates. 
---|---|--- 


     | 11.5 | _No Post-Closing Extension of Contracts._ Buyer shall not
renew or otherwise extend, or permit the renewal or extension of, the existing
term of, or create any new or additional obligations under, any of the
Contracts after Closing, except to 
---|---|--- 



 

46 Affiliates shall have any potential liability or responsibility thereunder
with respect to (i) any claims, liabilities or obligations relating to such
renewal or extension term or period, or (ii) such new or additional
obligation. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.6 | _Guarantees_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Buyer to be substituted in all respects for Seller and its
Affiliates, and Seller and their Affiliates released, effective as of the
Closing or as soon as possible thereafter, in respect of all obligations of
Seller and their Affiliates under each of the guarantees, indemnities, bonding
arrangements, letters of credit and letters of comfort given by Seller or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Business (the "Guarantees"), that are
specifically identified on _Exhibit 11.6_ hereto. If any such release cannot
be obtained, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and Sellers Affiliates
harmless from and against any liability and obligation relating to the
Guarantee not released. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.7 | _Privacy Policy_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall abide
by the policies set forth in _Exhibit 11.7_ with respect to the user
information and data referred to in Section 2.9. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.8 | _Record Retention._ All books and records related to the
Business (collectively, the "Records") shall be retained, whether by Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, for seven (7) years after the date such document was
created (the "Retention Term"). During the Retention Term, the party in
possession of such Records shall allow the other party and its representatives
access to inspect or copy the Records (at such inspecting partys cost) upon
reasonable advance written notice and during normal business hours. In the
event a party in possession of any Records intends to destroy any such Records
at the end of the Retention Term, such party shall first notify the other
party, at which time such second party shall have the right to remove the
Records at its own cost. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.9 | _Business Information; Cooperation in Litigation._ Buyer
and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with and provide to one another any such
records and information as may be reasonably required after Closing for
purposes of finalizing either partys accounting and Tax records of, and
resolving or responding to any audits, investigations, disclosures or other
government inquiries relating to the  
---|---|--- 



 

47 requesting party without charge, except that the requesting party will
reimburse the other party for any out-of-pocket copy costs. Further, the
parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other at the requesting partys
expense in the prosecution or defense of any dispute or litigation or other
proceeding, including without limitation the Retained Known Liabilities,
arising from their respective operation of the Business and involving one or
more third parties, including but not limited to affording reasonable access
to employees and access to, and information regarding, amounts in
dispute, information regarding former employees of the Business, and
documentation created in the running of the Business relating to such dispute
or litigation. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.10 | _Receivables_. Buyer will promptly forward to Seller any
payments Buyer receives on Business related receivables which exist as of the
Effective Time, payments Buyer receives on any receivables which relate to
businesses of Seller other than the Business, and any other payments Buyer
receives to which Seller is otherwise entitled. Seller will promptly forward
to Buyer any payments on Business related receivables that Seller might
receive to the extent such receivables arose out of Buyers operation of the
Business following the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.11 | _Environmental Covenant Not to Sue._ Subject to Buyers
indemnification rights in respect of (i) breaches of Section 9.15 hereof and
(ii) the Retained Known Liabilities, Buyer hereby forever waives, releases
and covenants not to bring or aid, except to the extent required by applicable
law, and shall indemnify and hold Seller and Sellers Affiliates harmless from
and against, any investigation, inquiry, claim, action, demand, litigation,
suit, arbitration, proceeding or prosecution, whether known, unknown, actual
or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, against Seller or its Affiliates (or
their respective affiliated predecessors), which arises from or relates to
the operation or violation of any applicable environmental law or regulation,
whether now existing or later enacted, in respect to the Assets, the
Contracts, the Owned Real Estate, the Facilities or to the operation of the
Business. Nothing herein, however, shall constitute a waiver of any right of
Buyer to seek recovery from any unaffiliated predecessor of Seller or its
Affiliates or from any third party insurance carrier, so long as Seller
and its Affiliates will 
---|---|--- 



 

48 insurance carrier (unless Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates
therefor). 
---|---|--- 


     | 11.12 | _Use Restriction_. From Closing through November 23,
2008, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will, within North America or
Central America (including Puerto Rico and the Caribbean region), without the
prior written consent of Seller, (i) use, license or otherwise allow any third
party to use (to the extent Buyer has rights to limit such use) the name
"Butterball," or any derivation thereof, as a trademark, service mark, trade
name or domain name in connection with any Restricted Activity, or (ii) use,
license or convey any rights to a third party to any trade dress or copyright
associated with products marketed under such name or mark in connection with
any Restricted Activity. If Buyer fails to keep or perform every covenant of
this Section 11.12, Seller shall be entitled to specifically enforce the same
by injunction in equity in addition to any other remedies which Seller may
have. If any portion of this Section 11.12 shall be invalid or unenforceable,
such invalidity or unenforceability shall in no way be deemed or construed to
affect in any way the enforceability of any other provision of this Section
11.12. If any court in which Seller seeks to have the provisions of this
Section 11.12 enforced determines that the activities, time or geographic area
hereinabove specified are too broad, such court may determine a
reasonable activity, time or geographic area and shall enforce this Section
11.12 for such activity, time and geographic area. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.13 | _Tax Benefits._ Seller shall cooperate as reasonably
requested with Buyer to obtain state and local governmental consents or
agreements to extend to Buyer the benefits of Sellers tax abatements and
credits related to the Business, and Seller hereby agrees that any recapture
of such tax benefits for pre-Closing periods or for which Seller is liable are
Sellers sole responsibility for which Seller shall hold Buyer harmless.
Notwithstanding the above, the extension of such benefits shall not be a
condition to the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


     | 11.14 | _Notification._ Prior to Closing, Buyer shall promptly
inform Seller in writing when it becomes aware of any material breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



 

49 ---|---|--- 



     | 11.15.1 | No later than the Closing Date, Buyer shall file with
the SEC an "automatic shelf registration statement," as such term is defined
under Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act, on Form S-3 (the "Shelf
Registration Statement"), that shall include a prospectus (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Prospectus") registering the public
resale of the shares of Buyer Common Stock (the "Registrable Shares") issued
under this Agreement from time to time from and after the Closing Date.
"Registrable Shares" shall also include securities of the Buyer issued or
issuable with respect to any such shares by way of a dividend or stock split
or in connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation or other reorganization or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 


     | 11.15.2 | Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective and available for resale of
the Registrable Shares and to file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements (including filing any post-effective amendments or prospectus
supplements thereto) as may be necessary to keep the Prospectus current and in
compliance, in all material respects, with the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder or as Seller may
reasonably request (such as to include Sellers plan of distribution with
respect thereto) until the earliest of (i) the expiration of the 12 month
period following the Closing Date, (ii) the sale of all the Registrable
Shares or (iii) the availability of Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act to sell
all of the Registrable Shares (the "Registration Period"). 
---|---|--- 
Buyer shall take all actions necessary to permit the resale by the Seller of
any Registrable Shares under the blue sky laws of such states as the Seller
may reasonably request, except that Buyer shall not for any such purpose be
required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not, but for the requirements of this Section,
be obligated to be so qualified, subject itself



 

50 general service of process in any such jurisdiction. 
---|---|--- 
All fees and expenses incurred by Buyer in performance of or in compliance
with this Section shall be borne by Buyer. Such fees and expenses shall
include, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities or
blue sky laws), (ii) printing expenses, (iii) fees and disbursements of
counsel for Buyer, and (iv) fees and disbursements of Buyers independent
certified public accountants. In addition, Buyer shall pay its internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of
its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties) and the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable
Shares on the NYSE. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Seller shall pay all of
its selling expenses, discounts, concessions and commissions with respect to
the Registrable Securities, together with the fees and expenses of Sellers
own counsel, accountants, other experts, officers and employees in connection
with such sale, and (ii) nothing herein shall require Buyer to participate in
any underwritten offering of the Registrable Shares, or sign any agreements,
make any representations, or incur any expenses with respect to any
underwritten offering.



     | 11.15.3 | Seller covenants and agrees that it will cooperate with
Buyer in connection with the preparation of the Shelf Registration Statement
and any prospectus supplement prior to and after the Closing Date for so long
as Buyer is obligated to maintain the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration
Statement, and will provide to Buyer, in writing, for use in a prospectus
supplement or in an amendment to the Shelf Registration
Statement, information regarding Seller, the plan of distribution for the
Registrable Shares and such other information as Buyer may reasonably request
to prepare prospectus supplements or amendments to the Shelf Registration
Statement and to maintain the effectiveness thereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.15.4 | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
11.15, Buyer may suspend the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement
and any resales of Registrable Shares thereunder (each such period, a
"Suspension Period") (x) upon the issuance by the SEC of a stop order 
---|---|--- 



 

51 Statement, the initiation of proceedings with respect to the Shelf
Registration Statement under Section 8(d) or 8(e) of the Securities Act or
the initiation of an SEC review of the Companys filings under the Exchange
Act, (y) if an event (a "Material Event") occurs and is continuing as a result
of which the Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein would,
in Buyers reasonable judgment, contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading or (z) the occurrence or
existence of any pending corporate development that, in the reasonable
discretion of Buyer, makes it necessary to suspend the availability of the
Shelf Registration Statement and any resales of Registrable Shares
thereunder, provided Buyer shall not have the right to suspend the Shelf
Registration Statement pursuant to clause (y) or (z) during the 10 business
day period after the Closing Date. Upon the occurrence of any such event,
Buyer shall notify Seller that the availability of the Shelf Registration
Statement is suspended and, upon receipt of any such notice by Seller, Seller
agrees not to sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement until Seller is advised in writing by Buyer that the Shelf
Registration Statement may be used, and has received copies of any additional
or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated
by reference in the Shelf Registration Statement. Buyer will use reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the use of the Shelf Registration Statement may be
resumed (A) in the case of clause (x) above, as promptly as is practicable,
(B) in the case of clause (y) above, as soon as, in the reasonable judgment
of Buyer, public disclosure of such Material Event would not be prejudicial to
or contrary to the interests of Buyer or, if necessary to avoid unreasonable
burden or expense, as soon as practicable thereafter and (C) in the case of
clause (z) above, as soon as in the reasonable discretion of Buyer, such
suspension is no longer appropriate. For the avoidance of doubt (and without
prejudice to the proviso contained in the first sentence of this Section
11.15.4), nothing in this Section 11.15 shall impose any obligation on Buyer
to engage in any discussions regarding a potential corporate 
---|---|--- 


 

52 within any time period or otherwise. Buyer shall be entitled to exercise its
right under this Section 11.15.4 to suspend the availability of the Shelf
Registration Statement or any Prospectus provided that the duration of the
Registration Period shall be extended by the aggregate duration of all
Suspension Periods. Buyer shall not be required to specify in any
written notice the nature of the event giving rise to the Suspension Period,
and Seller hereby agrees to hold such notice and any communications in
response thereto in confidence. 
---|---|--- 


     | 11.16 | _Listing of Shares of Buyer Common Stock._ Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for listing on the New
York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, as of the Closing
Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.17 | _Restrictions On Resale Of Buyer Common Stock._ The Buyer
Common Stock delivered by Buyer hereunder will be transferable by Seller only
pursuant to (a) public offerings registered under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities law or (b) an available exemption under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities law. The transfer agent for
the Buyer Common Stock will be instructed to block any transfers of Buyer
Common Stock that are not in compliance with these provisions. The certificate
representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock delivered hereunder shall be
imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form: 
---|---|--- 

"THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES ACT, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO THE
REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF SUCH ACTS OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM."

It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above shall be removed
by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if Seller
shall have delivered to Buyer an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the
Securities Act.



     | 11.18 | _Indemnification._ 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.18.1 | The Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller, and its officers, employees and agents and each person who controls
the

liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to the Buyer by the Seller or
the Sellers representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This
indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Buyer may
otherwise have including liability for indemnification under Section 16.2. 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.18.2 | The Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer and its directors and officers who sign such Registration Statement and
each person who controls the Buyer within the meaning of either the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Buyer to the Seller, but only with reference to information

Statement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which

shall have received reasonable assurance from the relevant third party that

and (ii) the failure to complete such transfer or assignment of, or otherwise
obtain, such Material Closing Document at or prior to the Closing Date shall
not prevent Buyer from operating the Business on the Closing Date in a manner
consistent with Sellers past practices.  
---|---|--- 



     | 13.6 | _No Additional Liabilities._ If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer notifies Seller of any facts or

reasonably be likely to constitute) an actual or  
---|---|--- 



 

57 Closing, then in each instance Seller shall have agreed that any such

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 13.6 shall not apply to any
liability (i) to the extent that Buyer is responsible therefor pursuant to
Section 16.4.3 hereof, or (ii) that is assumed by Buyer or its designee(s)

adverse effect on Buyers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated

with respect to breaches of representations and warranties unless the
individual or aggregate impact of all inaccuracies of such representations and
warranties would have a material adverse effect on the Business, taken as a
whole, or the ability of Seller to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 15.1.3 | _Buyer Breach._ By Seller if Buyer has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in any
material respect, if Seller has notified Buyer of the breach and the breach

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 15.1.4 | _Court Order._ By Buyer or Seller if any court of

termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to this Section 15, the terminating party shall
forthwith give written notice thereof to the other party and this Agreement

Affiliates, shall have any liability or further obligation to the other party,

other than pursuant to the provisions of this Section 15.2, and Sections 11.2,
18, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7 and 20.16 and under the Confidentiality Agreement (each

nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16. | _Indemnity._ 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.1 | _Indemnification of Buyer by Seller._ Seller shall
indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless against and in respect of
any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities, obligations and
claims of any kind, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees
and other legal costs and expenses (hereinafter referred to collectively as
"Losses"), that Buyer or any of its Affiliates may at any time suffer or
incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in connection with: 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.1 | Retained Payables; 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.2 | Retained Taxes; 
---|---|--- 



 

60 ---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.4 | Retained Known Liabilities; 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.5 | Retained Accrued Expenses; 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.6 | Pre-Closing Contingent Liabilities (other than the

---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.7 | Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller under this
Agreement, or any misrepresentation in or omission from any certificate or
other instrument furnished or to be furnished to Buyer hereunder. 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 16.1, and subject to
Buyers indemnification rights in respect of (i) breaches of Section 9.15
hereof and (ii) the Retained Known Liabilities, Seller shall have no indemnity
or any other obligation under this Agreement or otherwise for any liability
or obligation resulting from or arising in connection with any environmental
related matter or condition of any nature affecting or involving the Business,
the Facilities, the Owned Real Estate, the Contracts or the Assets including,
without limitation, any liability or obligation resulting from or arising in
connection with any actual, potential or threatened violation of any
applicable Environmental Law and/or Environmental Permit relating to
the Business, the Facilities, the Owned Real Estate, the Contracts and/or the
Assets and all such liabilities and obligations shall be assumed hereunder by
Buyer (the "Assumed Environmental Liabilities").



     | 16.2 | _Indemnification of Seller by Buyer._ Buyer shall
indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless against and in respect
of any and all Losses that Seller or any of its Affiliates may at any time
suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in connection with: 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.2.1 | The Assumed Liabilities; 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.2.2 | Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or

61 or other instrument furnished or to be furnished to Seller hereunder; and 
---|---|--- 


     | 16.2.3 | Claims by third parties (including governmental
authorities) relating to the operation and ownership by Buyer of the Assets
and the conduct of the Business from and after the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.3 | _Indemnification Procedures._ 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | For the purposes of this Section 16, the term "Indemnitee"
shall refer to the Person indemnified, or entitled, or claiming to be entitled
to be indemnified, pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.1 or 16.2, as the
case may be; and the term "Indemnitor shall refer to the Person having the
obligation to indemnify pursuant to such provisions. 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | An Indemnitee shall give written notice (a "Notice of
Claim") to the Indemnitor promptly after the Indemnitee has knowledge of any
claim (including a Third Party Claim, as hereinafter defined) which an
Indemnitee has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement. No failure to give such Notice of Claim
shall affect the indemnification obligations of the Indemnitor hereunder,
except to the extent such failure materially prejudiced such Indemnitors
ability to successfully defend the matter giving rise to the claim. The Notice
of Claim shall state the nature of the claim and the amount of the Losses,
if known, and refer to the provisions of this Agreement in respect to which
such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The obligations and liabilities of an Indemnitor under this
Section 16 with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that
are subject to the indemnification provisions provided for in this Section 16
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the additional
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 16.3(c). The Indemnitor shall
be permitted, at its option, to assume and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice (which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) if it gives 
---|---|--- 


 

62 Indemnitee and provided that the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing to the
Indemnitee that such Third Party Claim is covered by the indemnity provisions
of this Section 16\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not
be entitled to assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim if the
Indemnitor is also a party to the claim, and the Indemnitee reasonably
determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate
under the circumstances. In the event the Indemnitor exercises its right to
undertake the defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above,
the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in such defense and make
available to the Indemnitor all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee may participate by
its own counsel and at its own expense in defense of such Third Party Claim.
Similarly, in the event the Indemnitee is conducting the defense against any
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in
such defense and make available to it all such witnesses, records, materials
and information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may participate by
its own counsel and at its own expense in the defense of such third party
action. No Third Party Claim may be compromised or settled by the Indemnitor
without the written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (i) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of law or applicable regulations by the Indemnitee,
and no effect on any other claims that may be raised by the Indemnitee, and
(ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by
the Indemnitor. Similarly, no Third Party Claim may be settled by the
Indemnitee without the written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
Third Party Claim shall be asserted by notice by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnitor as provided in subsection (b) above. 
---|---|--- 



 

63 ---|---|--- 



     | 16.4.1 | _Cap._ The maximum aggregate liability of Seller for
indemnification obligations under Section 16.1.7 of this Agreement shall in no
event exceed $166,750,000.  
---|---|--- 



     | 16.4.2 | _Basket._ Except as set forth in Section 16.4.3, Buyer
shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 16.1.6 or Section
16.1.7 of this Agreement unless and only to the extent that the amount of all
Losses suffered or incurred by Buyer (excluding any Losses suffered or
incurred by, or the responsibility of, Buyer pursuant to Section 16.4.3 below)
exceeds $23,000,000 in the aggregate for all claims for which indemnity is
sought under such Sections; provided, however, that this Section shall not
apply to any breach of Section 9.5 (with respect to the Owned Real Property)
or Section 9.6 if and to the extent that the facts and circumstances giving
rise to such breach are identified by Buyer, and written notice thereof is
given to Seller, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 


     | 16.4.3 | _Continuing Environmental Diligence Limits._
Notwithstanding Section 16.4.2 hereof, in the event Buyer seeks indemnity for
any breach of Section 9.15 related to any DSD Facility, farm, warehouse or
other transferred property for which a Phase I assessment is not identified on
Section 9.15 of the Disclosure Schedule in respect of facts or circumstances
that are not specifically addressed in the Disclosure Schedule, liability for
all Losses that Buyer or any of its Affiliates may suffer or incur, or become
subject to, as a result of or in connection with such breach shall be
apportioned as follows: (i) Seller accepts full responsibility for the first
$500,000 of such Losses; (ii) Buyer accepts full responsibility for the second
$500,000 of such Losses; (iii) Buyer and Seller shall share equally the
responsibility for the next $5,000,000 of such Losses; and (iv) Seller
accepts full responsibility for all amounts in excess of $6,000,000. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.4.4 | _Sole Remedy._ Except in the case of fraud under
applicable state statutory and common law, and except as provided in Sections
7.1, 8.11, 11.18 and Section 19 hereof, each party agrees that its sole
remedy in respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereunder, 
---|---|--- 



 

64 warranty, representation or covenant, shall be limited to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 16.  
---|---|--- 



     | 16.4.5 | _Net Recovery._ The amount to which an Indemnitee may
become entitled hereunder shall be net of any recovery (whether by way of
payment, discount, credit, set-off, or counter-claim) received from a third
party (including any insurer) in respect of such claim. Any such recovery
shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor, less all
reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in
obtaining such recovery from the third party. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.4.6 | _Mitigation._ The Indemnitee will use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate the losses, costs, expenses and damages to
which it may become entitled to indemnification hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.4.7 | _Limitation of Damages._ Seller shall be responsible
only for direct damages, and for consequential damages that relate to product
recalls resulting from pathogenic, parasitic, allergenic, chemical or
radiological contamination or adulteration. Seller shall in no event be liable
for other consequential damages, or for incidental, indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary or similar damages or losses.  
---|---|--- 



     | 16.4.8 | _Time Limitations._ (a) Seller has no obligation to
indemnify Buyer under Section 16.1.7 hereof unless a written indemnification
claim is furnished by Buyer to Seller within the following time periods: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | The applicable statute of limitations (including all
extensions thereof in the case of Taxes) with respect to any matter underlying
any claims arising under Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.5, 9.10 and the first two
sentences of Section 9.11; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Eighteen (18) months after Closing for all other matters. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Seller has no obligation to indemnify Buyer under Section
16.1.6 hereof unless a written indemnification claim is furnished by Buyer to
Seller within two (2) years after Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
the 
---|---|--- 



 

65 precluded from asserting a claim to indemnification under Section 16.1.6
hereof because the matters underlying the claim are also the subject of a
representation or warranty with respect to which Buyer may be entitled to
indemnification under Section 16.1.7 hereof. 
---|---|--- 

17\. _Prorations._ All utility accounts at the Facilities shall be read as of
the Effective Time, and Seller shall be responsible for all utility charges
prior to such reading and Buyer shall be responsible for all utility charges
primarily related to the Business thereafter. All rent and other charges due
under the Contracts shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the
Effective Time. Except with respect to real and personal property
Taxes subject to Tax abatement or incentive arrangements which are allocated
in accordance with the following sentence, real and personal property Taxes,
assessments and similar items, if any, due with respect to the Assets shall be
prorated as of the Effective Time, and all such Taxes, assessments and
similar items allocable to any period prior to the Effective Time shall be
paid by Seller, and all such Taxes, assessments and similar items allocable to
any period subsequent to the Effective Time shall be paid by Buyer. With
respect to real and personal property Taxes which are subject to Tax abatement
or incentive arrangements, the portion of such Taxes that shall be allocable
to the period ending as of the Effective Time shall be computed as if such
period ended and the books of the Business were closed each as of the
Effective Time; provided, however, the foregoing shall not relieve Seller of
any liability or responsibility under Section 11.13 and shall not apply if and
to the extent the result would be to allocate to the period after the
Effective Time more than a pro rata portion of the amount of any such Tax
determined as if there were no abatement or incentive for any portion of the
actual Tax period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i)
if Seller pays any amount allocated to Buyer under this Section 17 Buyer will
reimburse Seller upon demand for the amount paid to the extent it is not
reflected as an asset on the final Statement of Net Working Capital; and (ii)
if Buyer pays any amount allocated to Seller under this Section 17 Seller will
reimburse Buyer upon demand for the amount paid to the extent it is not
reflected as a liability on the final Statement of Net Working Capital.
Notwithstanding the above, there shall be no duplication of adjustments
reflected in the final Statement of Net Working Capital.

18\. _Expenses._ Each party hereto shall pay its own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this
Agreement and other agreements and documents contemplated hereunder and
the consummation of the transactions



 

66 contemplated herein; provided, however, that (a) Buyer and Seller shall each
be responsible for one-half of (i) all sales, use, transfer, gross receipts,
documentary, stamp, recording, transfer, real estate excise and similar taxes
and fees ("Transfer Taxes") arising or incurred in connection with the
transfer of the Assets, (ii) all costs incurred by Seller for the real
property surveys and Environmental Site Assessments identified in the
Disclosure Schedule and for the real property surveys and environmental
reports obtained by Seller at Buyers request, including pursuant to Section
11.1.2 hereof, and (iii) the costs incurred by Seller for the title
commitments identified in the Disclosure Schedule and for the title
commitments obtained by Seller at Buyers request, including pursuant
to Section 11.1.2 hereof, and (b) Buyer shall be responsible for and pay any
additional title examination charges (other than in respect of any title
examinations ordered by Seller prior to Closing), closing, escrow or similar
fees charged by the respective title companies as well as the premiums for
any policies, and all endorsements thereto, issued therefrom. The parties
shall cooperate to comply timely with payment, tax returns and similar
requirements for the Transfer Taxes, and shall provide such documentation and
cooperate in such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to minimize the
amount of such Transfer Taxes. The party that makes payment to the taxing or
other authority shall provide proof of such payment to the other party
promptly after payment.

19\. _Bulk Sales Compliance._ Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer
hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of the bulk sales laws
of any state insofar as any such laws may apply to the transactions
contemplated herein. Except as otherwise provided herein, Seller hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against and shall on demand
reimburse Buyer for any and all Losses suffered by Buyer by reason of Sellers
failure to comply with such bulk sales laws.

20\. _Miscellaneous._ The following miscellaneous provisions shall apply to
this Agreement:



     | 20.1 | _Notices._ All notices which are required or may be given
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
sufficient in all respects if given in writing and delivered personally, or

     | 20.5 | _Applicable Law._ This Agreement and the legal relations
among the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with

the prior written consent of the other party hereto; provided, however, that
Buyer may assign its rights, including the rights to purchase all or a portion
of the Business, and obligations under this Agreement to any affiliates of
Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller, but no such assignments
shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement; and further
provided, however, that Seller may assign any or all of its rights under
Section 11.12 without Buyers prior consent.  
---|---|--- 



     | 20.10 | _Effect of Headings._ The headings of the various
sections and subsections herein are inserted merely as a matter of convenience
and for reference and shall not be construed as in any manner defining,
limiting or describing the scope or intent of the particular sections to which
they refer, or as affecting the meaning or construction of the language in the
body of such sections. 
---|---|--- 


     | 20.11 | _Exhibits; Disclosure Schedules._ All the exhibits and
the Disclosure Schedule referred to in this Agreement are attached hereto and
are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein. 
---|---|--- 



 

70 Agreement, the phrases "Sellers knowledge" or "to the knowledge of Seller,"
shall mean the actual knowledge after due inquiry of the persons listed on
_Exhibit 20.12_. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall in all
cases be construed as a whole according to its fair meaning, strictly neither
for nor against any party hereto, and without implying a presumption that the
terms thereof shall be more strictly construed against the party who drafted
the document or through its agent who prepared the same, it being agreed that
representatives of both parties have participated in the preparation hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.13 | _Contract Assignment._ If any Contract shall require the
consent of any party thereto other than Seller, such Contract shall not be
assigned to or assumed by Buyer if an actual or attempted assignment thereof
would constitute a breach or default thereunder. Seller and Buyer shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, to the extent
required, of such other parties to any such Contract. If any such consent
cannot be obtained, Seller and Buyer will cooperate in any reasonable
arrangement designed to obtain for Buyer all benefits and privileges of the
applicable Contract while protecting Seller and its Affiliates from
continuing liabilities or obligations thereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.14 | _Further Assurances._ Seller and Buyer agree that they
shall at any time, and from time to time after the Closing Date, upon the
reasonable request of the other party and without additional consideration,
do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or shall cause to be done, executed,
acknowledged and delivered, all such further acts, bills of sale, deeds,
assignments, transfers, conveyances, powers of attorney and assurances as may
be required in conformity with this Agreement and in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.15 | _Publicity; Public Announcements._ Buyer and Seller shall
consult with each other before the issuance of any press release or the making
of any other public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation or as to which the other party shall reasonably object, except
as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation
system. 
---|---|--- 



 

71 irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity permitted by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


     | 20.17 | _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed by
original or facsimile signatures in two counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and both of which together shall constitute the same
agreement, whether or not both parties execute each counterpart. 
---|---|--- 



 

72 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed on the day and year first above written.
