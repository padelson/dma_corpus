AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 10, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among Envestnet, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Yale
Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Yodlee, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination
transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which Merger Sub will, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ "), so that the Company is the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") in the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition of Parents willingness to enter
into this Agreement, concurrently with the entry of the parties into this
Agreement, funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus are entering into a voting
agreement with Parent; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger;

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The Company
shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and, except as set forth in
this _Article I_, shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware unaffected by the Merger. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 



 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, at the offices of Mayer Brown LLP, on a date which shall be no
later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject at Closing to the satisfaction or waiver
thereof) or at such other time and place as is agreed to in writing by Parent
and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of

      
 

 



 

Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") a certificate of merger in customary
form and substance and complying will the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_
"), and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective as of the time of filing of the Certificate of
Merger or, if a specific date and time is mutually agreed between the Company
and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger, as of such specified
date and time (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and
the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a)

 



 

(i) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "), except for Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Common
Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub), shall be
converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into
the right to receive, without interest (A) $10.78 in cash (the " _Per Share
Cash Consideration_ ") and (B) the number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.005 per share, of Parent
(the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") determined by dividing (1) $8.10 by (2) the
Parent Stock Value (such number of shares, the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ ") (the consideration described in clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Parent Stock
Value_ " shall be equal to the volume weighted average of the sales price per
share of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) full trading days ending on and
including the second (2nd) full trading day prior to the Closing Date, as
calculated by Bloomberg Financial LP under the function "ENV US Equity VWAP,"
subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Parent Stock Value is less than 90%
of the Reference Price, then the Parent Stock Value shall be equal to $39.006
and if the Parent Stock Value is greater than 110% of the Reference Price, the
Parent Stock Value shall be equal to $47.674. For purposes of this Agreement,
the " _Reference Price_ " shall be $43.34 and Parent and the Company shall,
prior to the Effective Time, jointly provide written notice to the Exchange
Agent stating the Parent Stock Value.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)(i)_ plus (B) the maximum number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, including shares of restricted stock
and shares of Parent Common Stock subject to restricted stock awards of Parent
issuable pursuant to _Section 1.7_ (the sum of the amounts in clauses (A) and
(B), the " _Total Stock Amount_ "), would be equal to or

 



      
 

 



 

greater than nineteen and nine-tenths percent (19.9%) of the shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
amount, the " _Stock Threshold_ "), the Per Share Stock Consideration shall be
decreased to the minimum extent necessary, such that the Total Stock Amount
shall not exceed the Stock Threshold. In such event, the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of (A) the
amount of such reduction in the Per Share Stock Consideration pursuant to the
preceding sentence multiplied by (B) the Parent Stock Value; provided that (i)
the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration shall in no event be increased by
greater than $32,000,000 and (ii) the Total Stock Amount shall in no event
exceed the Stock Threshold.

 



 

(b) All the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ",
it being understood that any reference herein to an "Old Certificate" shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "))
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration,
(ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares that the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ and _Section 2.2_, without any
interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions that the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, after the
date hereof, and prior to the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, , then
the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration and any
other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Cash
Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration or other dependent item,
as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this _Section
1.5(c)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

1.6 _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Vested Options_. Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have adopted resolutions (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent), and the Company hereby agrees to take all other actions reasonably
necessary, to cause, in accordance with the Yodlee, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan, as
amended; the Yodlee, Inc. 2001 Stock Plan, as amended; the Yodlee, Inc. 2009
Equity Incentive Plan, as amended; and the Yodlee, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive
Plan, as amended (collectively the " _Equity Plans_ "), each stock option
granted thereunder (" _Company Stock Option_ ") that is vested and exercisable
and that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing, including
Company Stock Options that will become vested as of the Closing (the " _Vested
Options_ ") to be exercised immediately prior to the Closing in a cashless net
exercise with shares of Company Common Stock that would otherwise be received
on the exercise of such Vested Option being retained by the Company to cover
the exercise price and any applicable tax withholding obligations and to issue
the net number of shares of Company Common Stock upon such net exercise to the
holder of such Company Stock Option where the value of a share of Company
Common Stock for purposes of the foregoing shall be the sum of (i) the Per
Share Cash Consideration and (ii) the value of the Per Share Stock
Consideration and for purposes of determining the value of the Per Share Stock
Consideration, the Parent Stock Value used to determine the Per Share Stock
Consideration will be used. As of the Effective Time, each such share of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the sum of
(i) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (ii) the Per Share Stock
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this _Article I_. Each Vested Option
outstanding immediately prior to the date of exercise, when exercised in
accordance with this _Section 1.7(a)_ or otherwise, shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist. The
Company agrees to process the exercise of the Vested Options through payroll
as appropriate and to remit any necessary withholding amounts that arise upon
the exercise of the Vested Options to the appropriate Tax authorities or
Governmental Entities, as required by applicable law.

 



 

(b) _Unvested Options_. Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have adopted resolutions (in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Parent), and the Company hereby agrees to take all other actions that are
reasonably necessary, in accordance with the Equity Plans, to cause the
assumption by Parent of all Company Stock Options granted pursuant to the
Equity Plans, other than Vested Options, that remain outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Unvested Options_ ") and the
conversion of such assumed Unvested Options into awards of restricted shares
of Parent Common Stock consistent with the terms of this _Section 1.7(b)_.
For each Unvested Option, the number of restricted shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued as part of the assumption and conversion of such Unvested
Stock Option shall be calculated by first multiplying (X) by (Y) and next
dividing the result by (Z) where (X) equals the difference between the value
of (i) the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) the value of
the Per Share Stock Consideration and (ii) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock for such Unvested Option, (Y) equals the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Option and (Z) equals
the Parent Stock Value. For avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining
the value of the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Parent Stock Value used to
determine the Per Share Stock Consideration will be used. The restricted
shares of Parent Common Stock received in connection with the assumption and
conversion of such Unvested Option shall become vested proportionally on the
same dates and

 



      
 

 



 

subject to the same terms and conditions generally of each applicable Unvested
Option. Each Unvested Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, when canceled and extinguished in exchange for the assumption of such
Unvested Option and conversion into restricted shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with this _Section 1.7(b)_, shall no longer be outstanding,
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

 



 

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have adopted resolutions (in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Parent), and the Company hereby agrees to take all other actions
reasonably necessary, in accordance with the Equity Plans, to cause the terms
of the assumption by Parent of all restricted stock units granted pursuant to
the Equity Plans (" _Company RSUs_ ") that remain outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Unvested RSUs_ ") and conversion of
such assumed Unvested RSUs into awards of restricted shares of Parent Common
Stock consistent with the terms of this _Section 1.7(c)_. For each Unvested
RSU, the number of restricted shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as
part of the assumption and conversion of such Unvested RSU shall be calculated
by first multiplying (X) by (Y) and next dividing the result by (Z) where (X)
equals the value of the sum of (i) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (ii)
the value of the Per Share Stock Consideration, (Y) equals the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested RSU and (Z) equals the
Parent Stock Value. For avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining the
value of the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Parent Stock Value used to
determine the Per Share Stock Consideration will be used. The restricted
shares of Parent Common Stock received in connection with the assumption and
conversion of such Unvested RSU shall become vested proportionally on the same
dates and subject to the same terms and conditions generally of each
applicable Unvested RSU. Each Unvested RSU outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, when canceled and extinguished in exchange for the
assumption of such Unvested RSU and conversion into restricted shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 1.7(c)_, shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

 



 

(d) _Notices_.

 



 

(i) The Company agrees to provided notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent) to each holder of Vested Options no less than fifteen days prior to
the day prior to Closing notifying the holder that the holder has no less than
fifteen days to exercise such Vested Option and that any Vested Option that
remains unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be exercised in a cashless net exercise as required by _Section
1.7(a)_.

 



 

(ii) The Company agrees to provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent) to each holder of Unvested Options and Unvested RSUs no less than
fifteen days prior to the Closing notifying the holder that such Unvested
Options and Unvested RSUs are being assumed by Parent consistent with the
requirements of the Equity Plans and as required by _Sections 1.7(b)_ and
_1.7(c)_ , respectively.

 



 

(e) _Form S-8 and Documentation_. Parent shall take reasonable actions as are
necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Unvested Options and
Unvested RSUs as provided pursuant to this _Sections 1.7(b)_ and _1.7(c)_ ,
respectively, including the reservation,

 



      
 

 



 

issuance and listing of the shares of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to
effectuate the assumption contemplated herein. Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on a Form S-8 (to the extent available)
within fifteen (15) days of the Closing Date with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such assumed award or otherwise register such shares
consistent with applicable law and will maintain the effectiveness the
registration statement while those assumed awards remain outstanding. Parent
shall prepare documentation, including, if applicable, a plan document and
grant agreement, for such assumed awards (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Company) such agreement and documentation will include a provision that
will permit the holder of such assumed award to satisfy any tax withholding
obligations that arise upon vesting or otherwise with respect to the assumed
awards to be satisfied by delivering the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to the award as are necessary to satisfy any such tax
withholding obligations and Parent agrees to remit any required amounts to the
appropriate Tax authorities or Governmental Entities, as required by
applicable law.

 



 

(f) If Parent and the Company reasonably determine in good faith and on
reliance upon the advice of counsel that the application of the terms of this
_Section 1.7_ with respect to any Vested Options, Unvested Options or
Unvested RSUs that is subject to the applicable laws of any foreign
jurisdiction (collectively, " _Stock Awards_ ") is not consistent with the
laws of such jurisdiction or would result in any adverse tax consequence
(whether to the individual holding such Stock Award, to Parent, to the Company
or to the Surviving Company), the Company and Parent agree to work in good
faith to adjust the treatment of such Stock Awards to the extent necessary in
order to comply with such laws or avoid such adverse tax consequence to the
extent practicable and in such a manner as yields to the holder of such Stock
Award the economic benefit intended by this _Sections 1.7(a)_ , _1.7(b) _or
_1.7(c)_ ; provided, that, such Stock Awards as are treated differently as a
result of the foregoing will remain subject to all other applicable terms of
this Agreement including, but not limited to, _Section 1.5(b)(ii)_.

 



 

1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.
(a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and
restated at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as set forth in the
form of _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation
Charter_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law
and (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the bylaws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time to become the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Bylaws_ "), until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

 



 

1.9 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The Board of Directors of Merger
Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation Charter and the
Surviving Corporation Bylaws.

 



 

1.10 _Appraisal Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock (including Book-Entry Shares) as to
which the holder thereof

 



      
 

 



 

(i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, (ii) has properly complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) has
not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (each, a "
_Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment
(subject to, and net of, any applicable withholding Tax), solely from the
Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares to the
extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL, except that (x) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the
circumstances permitted by Section 262 of the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its
rights for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (y) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in the DGCL or (z) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails
to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not
entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders
shall forfeit the right be paid the fair value of such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and such shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each
such share of Company Common Stock shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in _Section 2.2_, of such formerly Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of, together with copies of,
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served on or otherwise received by the
Company pursuant to the DGCL. Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any and all such
demands for appraisal. Without limiting, and in furtherance of, the foregoing,
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (i)
make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, (ii) offer to
settle or otherwise settle any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to
properly make or effect any such demand for appraisal or other action required
to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL or (iv) agree to do
any of the foregoing.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 



 

2.1 _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance
with this _Article II_, (a) evidence of Book-Entry Shares, representing the
Parent Common Stock (" _New Certificates_ "), to be given to the holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and this _Article II_ in
exchange for outstanding shares of such Company Common Stock, and (b) cash in
an amount sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all payments required
pursuant to this _Article II_ (such New Certificates and cash, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, _provided_ that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any

 



      
 

 



 

interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent or Merger Sub, or as otherwise directed by Parent.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of
record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_, a letter of transmittal in
customary form and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old
Certificates (or surrender of Book-Entry Shares) to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in
exchange for the consideration for certificates representing the number of
whole Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration which shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any
dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. From and
after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder
of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Company
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article
I_ and (ii) payment representing the amount of (A) the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article II_, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II _and
(C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued with respect to any property to be delivered upon surrender of
Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or
distributions as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II_. After the surrender of an Old Certificate
in accordance with this _Article II_, the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable after the Effective
Time with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted
into the right to receive.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent
Stock Value by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (rounded to
the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such holder as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time).

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and
any unpaid dividends and distributions on the shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such
stockholders hold as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Merger Sub
or Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this
_Section 2.2_ or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to
the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit in customary form of that fact by
the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
and dividends or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution hereof (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "), _provided_ , that any disclosures made with respect
to a section of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other
section of this _Article III_ specifically referenced or cross-referenced and
(2) any other sections of this _Article III_ to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to
such other sections; or (ii) as disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed
after June 30, 2014 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of
risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, effect, development,
circumstance, condition, state of facts, event or occurrence (an " _Effect_
"), individually or in the aggregate, that has a material adverse effect on,
with respect to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, the business,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Material Adverse
Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (i) changes, after the
date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted

 



       
 

 



 

accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), including accounting and financial
reporting pronouncements by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ "), (ii) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations
of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such party
and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or
Governmental Entities, (iii) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national, regional or local political conditions (including the outbreak of
war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate generally and not
specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (iv) any failure by
such party to meet any internal or published projections, estimates or
expectations of such partys revenue, earnings or other financial performance
or results of operations for any period, in and of itself, or any failure by
such party to meet its internal budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations, in and of
itself (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or
contributing to such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the
definition of a "Material Adverse Effect" may be taken into account), (v)
changes attributable to the announcement or pendency of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any litigation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the events leading
thereto (provided that this clause (v) shall not apply to any representation
or warranty to the extent that the purpose of such representation or warranty
is to address the consequences resulting from the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger), or (vi) any actions
expressly required by, or the failure to take any action expressly prohibited
by, the terms of this Agreement; except, with respect to subclause (i), (ii)
or (iii), such Effect shall be taken into account in the determination of
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred solely to the extent such
Effect materially and disproportionately affected the Company or Parent
relative to other participants in the industry in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate). As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ "
when used with respect to any party, means any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or other persons performing similar functions is
directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party and/or by one or more
of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) True and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the " _Company Certificate_ "), and
the bylaws of the Company, as amended (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by the
Company to Parent.

 



 

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) each
Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ "), (ii) the number of
authorized, allotted, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Company Subsidiary, (iii) each Company Subsidiarys jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization and (iv) the location of each Company
Subsidiarys principal executive offices, if any. Each Company Subsidiary (i)
is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified and, where applicable, in good standing
would reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite

 



      
 

 



 

corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted.

 



 

(d) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), other than Liens
for Taxes not yet due and payable or Taxes being contested in good faith and
for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP on
the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
all such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. No
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that have the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of
the Company may vote are issued or outstanding. No Company Subsidiary has or
is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary. Except for the shares of capital stock of the Company
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any shares of
capital stock in any entity.

 



 

(e) There are no restrictions on the ability of any Company Subsidiary to pay
dividends or distributions except as required by applicable law.

scope or procedure.

Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), except
(a) as reflected or reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance
sheet included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") (including any notes thereto),

the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (ii) has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside

Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the knowledge of the Company, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Copies of any such
disclosures were made in writing by management to the Companys auditors and
Audit Committee and a copy has been previously made available to Parent. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that the Companys
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, prior to the Closing Date.

whether written or, to the knowledge of the Company, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices or procedures of the Company or any of its

questionable accounting, auditing or actuarial practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub to the Company concurrently with the execution hereof (the "
_Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), _provided_ , that any disclosures made with
respect to a section of this _Article IV_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any
other section of this _Article IV_ specifically referenced or cross-
referenced and (2) any other sections of this _Article IV_ to the extent it
is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such other sections; or (ii) as disclosed in any Parent SEC Reports filed
after June 30, 2014 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of
risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature), Parent
and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Parent has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



 

(b) Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Sub has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted.

 



 

(c) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so

 



      
 

 



 

qualified and, where applicable, in good standing would reasonably be likely,
either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

 



 

4.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
500,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, par value $0.005 per share, and
50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.005 per share, of which no
shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding. As of July 31, 2015, no

reserved for issuance or outstanding, other than (i) 35,611,930 shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding, (ii) 11,925,265 shares of Parent
Common Stock held in treasury, and (iii) 4,725,037 shares of Parent Common
Stock reserved for issuance under Parent Stock Plans, and since July 31, 2015,
no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent have been
issued, other than pursuant to the exercise or settlement of outstanding
awards with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance
under Parent Stock Plans described in the preceding clause (iii). All the
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive
rights. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right
to vote on any matters on which stockholders of Parent may vote are issued or
outstanding.

 



 

4.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger have been duly and validly approved by the Board of
Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub. Subject to receipt of the adoption
of this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub are necessary
for Parent or Merger Sub to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and
Merger Sub, nor the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by each of Parent and Merger
Sub with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision
of the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, or
(ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in _Section
4.4_ are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a
breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets

 



      
 

 



 

of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation
to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,
except in the case of clause (ii) above for such violations, conflicts,
breaches, losses of benefit, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or creations which would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or
a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 in which the Proxy Statement will be included
as a prospectus, and declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4, (ii) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary pursuant to
the DGCL, (iii) the filing of any notices or other filings under the HSR Act,

issuance of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the
approval of the listing of such Parent Common Stock on the NYSE and (v) such
authorizations, consents, approvals, filings or registrations that, if not
obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent or a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, no consents or approvals of
or filings or registrations with any Governmental Entity are necessary in
connection with (A) the execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger
Sub of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date
hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of any reason why all necessary
regulatory approvals and consents will not be received in order to permit
consummation of the Merger on a timely basis.

 



 

4.5 _Reports_.

 



 

(a) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since December 31,
2012 (the " _Parent SEC Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Parent SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all Parent SEC Reports filed or furnished under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. No executive officer of Parent has failed to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from, or
material unresolved issues raised by, the SEC with respect to any of the
Parent SEC Reports.

 



      
 

 



 

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders
equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to normal year-end adjustments),
(ii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the

the notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have
been, since January 1, 2012, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP, and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements. KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries has any
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due) that would be required by GAAP to
be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in Parents consolidated balance sheet included in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 (including any notes
thereto), (b) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
since March 31, 2015, (c) liabilities under this Agreement, including fees and
expenses payable to any accountant, outside legal counsel or financial advisor
which are incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger) and (d) for liabilities which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parents outside auditors and the Audit Committee of Parents Board of
Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting.
Copies of any such disclosures were made in writing by management to Parents
auditors and Audit Committee and a copy has been previously made available to
the Company. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that
Parents outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2012, (i) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices or procedures of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting, auditing or actuarial practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities

any of their respective officers, directors or employees to the Board of
Directors of either Parent or Merger Sub or any committee thereof or to the
knowledge of Parent, to any director or officer of Parent or Merger Sub.

practice.

 



 

4.9 _Legal and Regulatory Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding pending, or to Parents knowledge, threatened in writing against it

individuals capacities as such of it or any of its Subsidiaries (and it is
not aware of any basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (i) that

performing its obligations under, or consummating the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement, or (iii) that is of a material nature
challenging the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, there is no material injunction, order, judgment or
decree imposed upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.

statements of Parent incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement, the
Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto or (d) any other document

Company or its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Form

4.11 _Stock Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time for
the past three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries

executed copies of a commitment letter (together with the executed fee letter
related thereto of even date herewith from BMO Capital Markets Corp. and any
related exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other

precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter in the form so
delivered to the Company. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing, together

6.2 _Company Meeting; Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company
Certificate and Company Bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") to be held as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger, and, if reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent,
upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special
meeting of stockholders to adopt a merger agreement. Subject to the
penultimate sentence of this _Section 6.2(a)_, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders
of the Company the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its
stockholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement) that they adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "). The Company shall engage a proxy solicitor
reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
stockholders relating to the Requisite Company Vote. Prior to the time that
that the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, neither the Board of Directors of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall (1) withdraw or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation or (2) recommend, declare advisable or propose publicly to
recommend or declare advisable, the approval, acceptance or adoption of any
Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Agreement or resolve or agree to take
any such action (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such action
being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote,
if the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that, because of the receipt by the Company of an
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.11(a)_)
that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith constitutes
a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may (x) in
connection with such Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or (y) terminate this Agreement for the purpose of causing the Company to
enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
(provided that such termination shall not be effective until and unless the
Company shall have paid the Termination Fee in connection with such
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_), which
the Company shall enter into concurrently with or immediately following such
termination; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company may not
take any actions under clause (x) or clause (y) of this sentence unless (i) it
gives Parent at least three (3) business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, which shall include a description of the then
current material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the person making the Superior Proposal (including the ultimate
parent of such person) and any subsequent material amendment or modification
thereof), (ii) during the three (3) business days following such written
notice, the Companys Board of Directors and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby proposed by Parent; and (iii) at the end of such three (3)
business day period, the Board of Directors of the Company, taking into
account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent and
after consultation with its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary

 



      
 

 



 

duties under applicable law (it being understood that any material amendment
to the Superior Proposal will require a new notice period as referred to in
_clause (i)_ of this _Section 6.2(a)_ (except that such notice period shall
be two (2) business days) and require compliance with the other provisions of
_clauses (i) (iii)_ of this _Section 6.2(a)_), _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Board
of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside counsel and
its financial advisors, determines in good faith that, because of the
occurrence of an Intervening Event that the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take
such action unless (i) it gives Parent at least three (3) business days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which shall include a
description of the reasons therefor, (ii) during the three (3) business days
following such written notice, the Companys Board of Directors and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent; and (iii) at the end of
such three (3) business day period, the Board of Directors of the Company,
taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed
by Parent and after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. As used in this agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means any
event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition that is material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, that occurs or arises
after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and
that was not, prior to the date of this Agreement, known by or reasonably
foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if known, the
consequences of which were not reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this
Agreement); provided, however, that in no event will the trading price of the
Company Common Stock or the receipt, existence or terms of an Alternative
Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an
Intervening Event.

 



 

(b) The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting, if (A) as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote,
(B) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting by
applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff, or (C) if the
Company has sent to the stockholders of the Company or otherwise made
available to them any new material information or disclosure since the date of
the Proxy Statement, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (or
any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn
the Company Meeting in order to give the stockholders of the Company
sufficient time to evaluate any such new material information or disclosure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be
convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, for
the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained

 



      
 

 



 

herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation (including
any Adverse Recommendation Change).

 



 

6.3 _Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company
and Parent shall (i) make or cause to be made the filings required of such
party under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date
with any request under the HSR Act for additional information, documents or
other materials received by such party from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust
Division_ ") or by any other Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or
the Merger and (iii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other
party in connection with any such filings and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Entity
with respect to any such filing or the Merger. Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party
will provide the other with copies of any applications and all correspondence
relating thereto prior to filing, other than any portions of material filed in
connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other
proprietary information filed under a claim of confidentiality and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information. The parties hereto
agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
herein. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement shall require Parent or the Company to take, or commit to take,
any action or agree to any condition or restriction that would reasonably be
likely to result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition. For purposes
of this Agreement, a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ " shall
mean making proposals, executing or carrying out agreements (including consent
decrees) or submitting to Laws (i) providing for the transfer, license, sale
or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust
or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or the holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of the shares of capital stock of any
Company Subsidiary or any Parent Subsidiary or (ii) imposing or seeking to
impose any limitation on the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses or own such
assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the
business of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries, in each case other than any de minimis administrative or
ministerial obligations.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, (i) that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the
time the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) that none of
the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the
time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading. Each of Parent and the Company further
agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would
cause any of the statements in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement to be false
or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate
steps to correct the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any such consent or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any
such approval will not be timely received.

 



 

6.4 _Access to Information; Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel,

 



      
 

 



 

advisors and other representatives of Parent reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems and
records, and each shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, nondisclosure and similar agreements with service providers),
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, make available to Parent such information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to minimize any interference with the Companys
regular business operations during any such access. Upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, furnish or otherwise make
available to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other
representatives of the other party such information concerning its businesses
as is reasonably relevant to such party and its stockholders in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or work-product
protection of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will seek
to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(b) Each party shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the
other party or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated February 26, 2015,
as amended April 22, 2015, by and between Parent and the Company (the " _Non-
Disclosure Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by Parent, the Company or their respective
representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth
herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

 



 

6.5 _Further Assurances_. Subject in all respects to _Section 6.3_, each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any
material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

6.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notices of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

6.7 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) As a result of the Merger, each of the current employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who remain employed as of the Effective Time shall become
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Employees_ ") by operation of law. For the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on December 31, 2016, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any successor thereto to maintain (x) base
compensation (including base salary or base hourly wage) (y) target bonus and
other incentive opportunities consistent with past practice of the Company for
each Employee (provided that the bonus and other incentive opportunity remains
subject to satisfaction of applicable performance goals and the bonus or
incentive opportunity does not in any way guaranty any bonus or grant amount
and provided further that the Parent retains the discretion to determine the
mix of cash and equity of any such bonus or incentive opportunity distribution
consistent with the mix of cash and equity determined for similarly situated
employees of Parent), and (z) employee benefits that are no less favorable
than the benefits provided in the aggregate to similarly situated employees of
the Parent.

 



 

(b) On or after the Closing Date upon a transition date to be selected by the
Parent in its sole discretion (the " _Transition Date_ "), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries of
Parent to permit the Company Employees to enroll and participate the employee
benefit or compensation plans, programs or arrangements adopted, maintained or
contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Corporation and/or their
Subsidiaries in which employees of the Company are eligible to participate
(the " _Parent Plans_ "). The Transition Date may be a different date for
separate Parent Plans. Until the applicable Transition Date is selected for a
Parent Plan, the Parent shall or shall cause the Companies and/or the
appropriate subsidiaries of Parent to maintain the corresponding Company
Benefit Plans in which the Company Employees are eligible to participate in
accordance with their terms. Further, if the Parent elects to require the
Company to terminate the Savings Plan in accordance with _Section 6.7(d)_,
the Transition Date with respect to the Parent Plan corresponding to the
Savings Plan shall be the Closing Date. With respect to any Parent Plans in
which the Company Employees become eligible to participate on or after the
applicable Transition Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to, no later than
the applicable Transition Date: (i) provide the Company Employees with service
credit for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of
benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan), under each applicable Parent Plan for all periods of employment with
the Company or any predecessor entity to the extent that such service was
taken in to account under the applicable plan of the Company, prior to the
Effective Time, and with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates on and after the Effective Time; and (ii) cause any
pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or
required physical examinations under any Parent Plan to be waived with respect
to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived
under the corresponding plan in which the applicable Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will any service prior to the Effective Time

 



       
 

 



 

with the Company or any of its Affiliates or any predecessor count as service
with Parent for purposes of the Parent Scholarship Plan.

 



 

(c) In the event that the employment of any Company Employee shall be
terminated without cause at any time during the twelve (12)-month period
following the Effective Time, such Company Employee shall, subject to such
Company Employee signing and not revoking a general release of claims against
the Company, the Surviving Company, the Parent and their respective affiliates
that becomes effective within sixty days of the date of such termination, be
entitled to receive (i) continued base salary for at least three (3) months
(without duplication, however, with any payment under any severance or
separation plan or program of general applicability maintained by Parent or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Severance Plans_ ") or any
individual agreement between the Employee and the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries) and (ii) with
respect to the fiscal year in which such termination occurs, a payment equal
to the bonus or variable compensation otherwise payable under any management
incentive plan or other similar plan or program maintained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in which the employee is participating at the time of
termination as determined by Parent in good faith with such amount no greater
than the amount of bonus paid with respect to such Company Employee consist
with past practice and with such bonus amount prorated based on the number of
days that the employee was employed by the Surviving Corporation during such
fiscal year. In the event that the employment of any current employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated without cause at any
time after the initial 12-month period of the Closing, such employees shall be
entitled to receive severance benefits equal to the benefits under the Parent
Severance Plans, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee who
is a party to an individual agreement that provides for the payment of
severance in any amount or who would be entitled to statutory payments of
severance pursuant to local law shall not be eligible for the payments
described in this _Section 6.7(c)_.

 



 

(d) The Company shall adopt resolutions to terminate the Yodlee, Inc. 401(k)
Plan " _Savings Plan_ ") effective prior to the Effective Time, unless Parent
provides written notice to the Company no later than fifteen (15) days prior
to the Closing Date that it should not terminate the Savings Plan.

 



 

(e) _280G Calculation_. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten
(10) days after the date requested, the Company will make available to Parent
all information reasonably requested by Parent in order for the Parent to
determine if any person is reasonably likely to receive payments or benefits
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would
not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied (i) shall cause either Parent or any of its affiliates to
be obligated to continue to employ any person, including any Employees, for
any period of time following the Effective Time, (ii) shall prevent Parent or
its affiliates from revising, amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan
or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to
time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan, or
(iv) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any director, officer,
employee or individual Person, including

 



      
 

 



 

any present or former employee, officer, director or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such individual.

 



 

6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless each present or former director, or officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "
_Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, for acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, to the same
extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, or the Company Bylaws, or the
governing or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof or entered into
prior to Closing on the same form as in existence as of the date hereof; and
the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses as incurred by such Company
Indemnified Parties to the same extent as such persons are entitled to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to the Company Certificate, or the Company Bylaws, or the governing
or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and any indemnification
agreements in existence as of the date hereof; _provided_ that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a
reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

 



 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to
the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers
and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and
if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap,
then the Surviving Corporation shall maintain policies of insurance which, in
the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, the Company may in consultation with Parent (and at the request
of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage
to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same
may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the
Premium Cap.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If either
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or any of its successors or assigns,
consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or
substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in
any similar transaction, then in each case, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, will expressly assume the obligations of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of any of the parties to
the Merger, each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by any other party, at the expense of the party who makes
any such request.

 



 

6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise
the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has
had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii)
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that reasonably would be expected to give rise, individually
or in the aggregate, to the failure of one of its conditions in _Section
7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.3(a)_ to be satisfied.

 



 

6.11 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall

_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, prior to receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote, in the event Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely
to result in a Superior Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel, and with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall have provided
notice to Parent of its intention to provide such information, and shall
contemporaneously provide or make available such information to Parent if not
previously provided to Parent, and shall have entered into a non-

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it
than the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which non-disclosure agreement shall not
provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company,
but which non-disclosure agreement shall not be required to include any
"standstill" or similar provision. The Company will, and will cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any

related developments, discussions and negotiations on a prompt basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry
or Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall within ten (10) business days after
the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any
confidential information provided to any person (other than Parent and its
affiliates) pursuant to any non-disclosure agreement. The Company shall not,

relating to any Acquisition Proposal (each an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in, (i) any

percent (20%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning twenty
percent (20%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination, reorganization, joint venture,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section
6.11(a)_ that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith to

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after consultation
with its financial advisors, (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii)
after taking into account all legal (after consultation with outside counsel),
financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions
and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted

 



      
 

 



 

under applicable law; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "twenty percent (20%) or more" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority."

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of
Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position

provided in the next proviso or in a notice to Parent provided under _Section

Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless it
includes either an express rejection of the Acquisition Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation; _provided, further_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, that it shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for the Company Board to make a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d9-f or any substantially similar
communication in connection with any Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender
offer. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from making any disclosure to its stockholders that is

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver

Company of their intention to make any amendment pursuant to clause (b) of
this _Section 6.19_ or to obtain any alternative financing pursuant to this
clause (c) of _Section 6.19_ and shall keep the Company reasonably informed
of the terms thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company true

commitment letters). In such event, the term "Commitment Letters" as used
herein shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letters that are not so

deemed to include the financing contemplated by any such new or amended
commitment letters.

 



 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective
officers, managers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, accountants,

this _Section 6.19(a)_;

assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (5) provide any
information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under

connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken
in accordance with this _Section 6.19_) or any information utilized in
connection therewith, except for any of the foregoing to the extent the same
is the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, managers, employees,
agents, consultants, advisors, accountants, financial advisors, legal counsel
and other representatives.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company:

 



 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in a written
instrument;

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order, injunction or
decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before February 15, 2016 (the " _Termination Date_ "),
unless the failure of the consummation of the Merger to occur by such date
shall be due to the material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the

 



      
 

 



 

representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in
the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination
by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in
the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, and which is not cured
within the earlier of the Termination Date and forty-five (45) days following
written notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or
Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company;

 



 

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if the Company Meeting shall have been
held and the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained thereat or at
any adjournment or postponement thereof;

 



 

(f) by Parent, if prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof)
has made an Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the Company has failed to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (iii) the Company
or the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) willfully
and materially breaches any of its obligations under _Section 6.2_ or its
obligations under _Section 6.11_; or

 



 

(g) by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this _Section 8.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 9.5_, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Company, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _Section 6.4(b)_,
this _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from
any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) (i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_, or by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ as a result of a material breach of covenant by the Company, and (B)
prior to the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made known to senior management of the Company or shall have been made
publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an Acquisition
Proposal and (C) within twelve (12) months of the date of such termination,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal

 



      
 

 



 

(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to in clause
(B) of this _Section 8.2(b)(i)_), then the Company shall, on the earlier of
the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation
of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee
equal to $17.8 million (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for
purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)_, all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "twenty (20%)" shall instead refer to "fifty (50%)".

 



 

(ii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ and (B) prior to the date of such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
become publicly known and not withdrawn and (C) within twelve (12) months of
the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to in clause (B) of this
_Section 8.2(b)(ii)_), then the Company shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination
Fee; provided, that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_, all references
in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty (20%)" shall instead
refer to "fifty (50%)".

 



 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the
date of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days
thereafter).

 



 

(iv) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(g)_ (with respect to a termination effected under _Section
6.2(a)_), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to
pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay
the costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company fails to
pay the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, then the Company
shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of
the date that any such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as reported by _The Wall Street
Journal_ or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment
was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by the Company under this _Section 8.2_ shall be equal
to the Termination Fee, and in no event shall

 



      
 

 



 

the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in
which such fee is payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

Common Stock and the Company Equity Awards entitled to receive the
consideration pursuant to the Merger, this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to and does not confer
upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice
or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties

not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Except as provided in _Section 6.8_,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, no consent,
approval or agreement of any third party beneficiary will be required to

including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the

performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 



 

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be

any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
