multiplied by such amount of the Deferred Cash Purchase Price, multiplied by
(a) the number of days passed since the Closing Date divided by (b) three
hundred sixty-five (365) shall be paid by Parent to the Paying Agent (on
behalf of the Sellers) within three (3) Business Days after such eighteen (18)
month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any
unresolved claim exists with respect to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is
asserting a set-off pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_, the amount of any such
claim shall continue to be held by Parent until resolution of such claim in
accordance with this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall have a right of set-off with respect to (i) $22,523,162 of
the Deferred Cash Purchase Price to secure payment of the Company Indemnifying
Parties indemnification obligations under _Section 13_ (the " _General Set-
Off Amount_ "), (ii) $1,018,177 of the Deferred Cash Purchase Price to secure
payment of the Magneton Transfer Amount paid by the Company to the OCS under
_Section 7.11_ (the " _Magneton Set-Off Amount_ ") (iii) $126,890 of 

 



21  the Deferred Cash Purchase Price to secure liability of the Unfunded Pension
and Severance Reduction under _Section 7.15_ (the " _Unfunded Pension Set Off
Amount_ "), and (iv) $500,000 of the Deferred Cash Purchase Price to secure
payment of any post-Closing cash adjustments in favor of Buyer under _Section
3.2_ (the " _Closing Cash Balance Set-Off Amount_ "), in each case subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. If Parent or any other
Buyer Indemnified Party asserts a right of set-off pursuant to this _Section

Amount, the Unfunded Pension Set Off Amount or the Closing Cash Balance Set-
Off Amount, as applicable, shall be reduced to the extent that the applicable
claim is not subject to a dispute between the parties, and any such reduction
shall be deemed to be a reduction to the Deferred Cash Purchase Price;
_provided_ , _however_ , if the applicable claim is subject to a dispute
between the parties, then such parties shall resolve the disputed claim in
accordance with the applicable terms of this Agreement to which such claim
relates.

2.6 _Stock Consideration_. The Paying Agent, pursuant to the Paying
Agent Agreement and/or other documentation entered into among the Paying
Agent, the Sellers, the Option holders and Warrant holders, will act as the
custodian, transfer agent and payment and withholding agent with respect to
the receipt and disposition of the Stock Consideration on behalf of the
Sellers, the Option holders and Warrant holders. The Paying Agent, pursuant to
the Paying Agent Agreement, will be subject to certain restrictions in its
capacity as custodian, transfer agent and payment and withholding agent with
respect to the Stock Consideration, including a restriction on transferring,
selling, pledging, encumbering or otherwise disposing of any of the Stock
Consideration for a period of three (3) months after the Closing Date (the "
_Lock-Up Period_ ").

2.7 _Escrow Substitution_.

 

(a) At any time following the Closing, Parent or Buyer may in its sole
discretion elect to fund (an " _Escrow Substitution_ ") all or a portion of
the Deferred Purchase Price or the Employee Holdback Amount (collectively, and
including any accrued interest thereon and taking into account any deductions
or offsets pursuant to this Agreement or any Employee Holdback Agreement, the
" _Applicable Deferred Amount_ ") into one or more escrow accounts established
pursuant to an escrow agreement(s) entered into by and among Parent, Buyer or
the Company, the Paying Agent, the Seller Representative and the Escrow
Agent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller
Representative (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall be obligated to enter into
the Escrow Agreement within five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Seller
Representative and the applicable Seller or Employee/Service Providers of the
notice referenced in _Section 2.7(b)_ so long as it contains escrow
distribution mechanics consistent with the set-off rights mechanics applicable
to the Applicable Deferred Amount in this Agreement and the Employee Holdback
Agreements. Upon any Escrow Substitution, any portion of the
Applicable Deferred Amount funded in escrow pursuant thereto shall no longer
accrue interest pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Employee
Holdback Agreements, as applicable, and any interest accruing thereafter on
any such amounts shall accrue in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If
only a portion of the Applicable Deferred Amount is subject to an Escrow
Substitution, any remaining portions thereof shall continue to be subject to
the terms of this Agreement or the Employee Holdback Agreements, as
applicable.

 



22 (b) If Parent or Buyer elects to fund all or any portion of the Applicable
Deferred Amount into an escrow account(s) pursuant to this _Section 2.7_,
Parent or Buyer shall provide the Seller Representative and the applicable
Seller or Employee/Service Provider with prior written notice thereof. Any
reduction of the Employee Holdback Amount pursuant to an Escrow Substitution
shall be incurred by the applicable Sellers and Employee/Service Providers pro
rata based on the amounts payable under the Employee Holdback Agreements, and
the Employee Holdback Agreements shall be deemed amended to reflect the
occurrence of any Escrow Substitution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the
avoidance of doubt, in the event of any conflict between this Agreement and
the Employee Holdback Agreements, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, upon any Escrow Substitution, any references
in this Agreement providing Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party with
rights of set-off pursuant to _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to also provide
Buyer and any other Buyer Indemnified Party recourse against amounts held
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement with respect to any claims providing for
such set-off.

SECTION 3

 

 _CLOSING; CLOSING CASH BALANCE; WITHHOLDING_

3.1 _Closing_. The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place electronically on the date hereof (the " _Closing Date_ ").

3.2 _Closing Cash Balance_.

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Cash Balance_. Not later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have delivered to Buyer a
written statement setting forth its good faith estimate of the Closing Cash
Balance as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Closing Cash Balance_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the Companys
calculation of the Estimated Closing Cash Balance (including any Company Debt
or Seller Parties Transaction Expenses deducted therefrom). If the Estimated
Closing Cash Balance is less than the Closing Cash Balance Target Amount,
the amount of such deficit shall be the " _Estimated Closing Cash Balance
Deficit_." If the Estimated Closing Cash Balance is greater than the Closing
Cash Balance Target Amount, the amount of such excess up to the Closing Cash
Balance Surplus Cap shall be the " _Estimated Closing Cash Balance Surplus_."
To the extent practicable, the Company and Buyer shall cooperate to update and
issue revisions to the Estimated Closing Cash Balance after delivery of the
written statement contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ as of the actual
Closing Date.

(b) _Determination of Final Closing Cash Balance_. Within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date (" _Closing Cash Balance Adjustment Period_ "),
Buyer shall provide to the Seller Representative a statement setting forth in
reasonable detail Buyers calculation of the Closing Cash Balance (the "
_Draft Closing Cash Balance Statement_ "). After delivery of the Draft Closing
Cash Balance Statement, the Seller Representative and its accountants shall be
permitted to review and copy the work papers of

 



23  Buyer and its accountants related to the preparation of the Draft Closing
Cash Balance Statement and make other inquiries regarding questions
concerning, or disagreements with, the Draft Closing Cash Balance Statement
arising in the course of its review, in each case as reasonably requested by
the Seller Representative. The Seller Representative shall deliver, on or
prior to the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after its receipt of the
Draft Closing Cash Balance Statement (the " _Objection Deadline Date_ "), a
written notice indicating that either the Seller Representative accepts the
Draft Closing Cash Balance Statement (the " _Acceptance Notice_ ") or a
statement describing in reasonable detail all objections to the Draft Closing
Cash Balance Statement (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If the Seller
Representative timely delivers an Objection Notice, such objections shall be
resolved as follows:

(i) Buyer and the Seller Representative shall first use all reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections and if it is so resolved, the Draft
Closing Cash Balance Statement shall be modified as necessary to reflect such
resolution and such resolution as reflected in the Draft Closing Cash Balance
Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties.

(ii) If Buyer and the Seller Representative do not reach a resolution of
all objections set forth in the Objection Notice within twenty (20) Business
Days after the Objection Deadline Date, the dispute shall be referred, on the
application of either Buyer or the Seller Representative, to an independent
internationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and
the Seller Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") within ten (10) Business
Days after the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period. If Buyer
and the Seller Representative are unable to agree on an independent
internationally recognized accounting firm within ten (10) Business Days, then
Buyer and the Seller Representative shall each select an accounting firm
within ten (10) days after the end of such ten (10) Business Day period, and
such accounting firms shall promptly communicate with each other and agree on
an independent internationally recognized accounting firm within ten (10)
days, and the selected accounting firm shall be the Accounting Firm
hereunder. The Accounting Firm shall resolve any remaining objections set
forth in the Objection Notice (the " _Unresolved Objections_ "). Each of Buyer
and the Seller Representative shall promptly, but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days following the referral of the Unresolved Objections to the
Accounting Firm, prepare a written statement describing their respective
positions with respect to the Unresolved Objections, which, together with the
relevant documents, will be submitted to the Accounting Firm for review and
final determination. Following submission of any Unresolved Objections to the
Accounting Firm, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall furnish
the Accounting Firm with such information and documents as the Accounting
Firm may reasonably request in order to resolve the Unresolved Objections.

(iii) Within thirty (30) days after the date of its engagement, the Accounting
Firm shall make a determination as to the resolution of the Unresolved
Objections and shall issue a ruling of such resolution, which shall be
binding upon the parties and include an illustration of all adjustments to the
Draft Closing Cash Balance Statement based on any resolutions to objections
agreed upon by Buyer and the Seller 

 



24  Representative and pursuant to the Accounting Firms resolution of the
Unresolved Objections. The Accounting Firm shall make a determination only as
to the Unresolved Objections and shall not decide any specific items not
under dispute and its determination as to the Unresolved Objections shall be
within the range of values assigned to each such disputed item in the Draft
Closing Cash Balance Statement and the Objection Notice, respectively.

(iv) The Final Closing Cash Balance Statement shall be conclusive and binding
upon Buyer and the Seller Representative. Buyer and the Seller Representative
agree that the procedure set forth in this _Section 3.2(b)_ for resolving
disputes with respect to the Draft Closing Cash Balance Statement shall be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving such disputes and the Final Closing
Cash Balance Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties;
_provided_ , that this provision shall not prohibit either Buyer or the Seller
Representative from instituting litigation to enforce the ruling of the
Accounting Firm. As used herein, the term " _Final Closing Cash Balance
Statement_ " shall mean and refer to (i) the statement setting forth the
Estimated Closing Cash Balance delivered by Company to Buyer pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 3.2(a)_ above, to the extent that no Draft Closing
Cash Balance Statement is delivered by Buyer to Company within the Closing
Cash Balance Adjustment Period, or (ii) the Draft Closing Cash Balance
Statement delivered by Buyer to the extent that the Seller Representative
delivers to Buyer an Acceptance Notice or fails to deliver an Objection Notice
by the Objection Deadline Date, or (iii) the Draft Closing Cash Balance
Statement as adjusted pursuant to (a) the mutual resolution of Buyer and the
Seller Representative as set forth in _Section 3.2(b)(i)_ above or (b) the
Accounting Firms resolution of the Unresolved Objections. The Closing Cash
Balance set forth in the Final Closing Cash Balance Statement shall be
referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Cash Balance_."

(v) Buyer and the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, will each
bear their own fees and expenses, including the fees and expenses of their
respective accountants, in preparing or reviewing, as the case may be, the
Draft Closing Cash Balance Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer and the Seller
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, based on the inverse of
the percentage that the Accounting Firms determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total Unresolved Objections
originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. For example, should the
Unresolved Objections total an amount equal to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm
awards $600 in favor of the Seller Representatives position, sixty percent
(60%) of the costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and forty percent
(40%) of the costs would be borne by the Seller Representative, on behalf of
the Sellers. However, Buyer and the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, will each bear its own costs in presenting its position regarding any
Unresolved Objections to the Accounting Firm.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. Within three (3) Business Days after the
earliest to occur of: (A) the expiration of the Closing Cash Balance
Adjustment Period, (B) the expiration of the Objection Deadline Date, if no
Objection Notice is delivered by said date, (C) delivery by the Seller
Representative of the Acceptance Notice to Buyer and (D) the mutual

 



25  or final resolution of any Unresolved Objections pursuant to _Section
3.2(b)_ above, the " _Cash Adjustment Amount_ " shall be calculated and
distributed to Buyer or the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Sellers), as
applicable, as follows:

(i) If the Final Closing Cash Balance is  _equal to_ the Estimated Closing
Cash Balance the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to equal $0.00.

 

(ii) If (A) an Estimated Closing Cash Balance Deficit existed at the Closing
and (B) the Final Closing Cash Balance is _less_ _than_ the Estimated Closing
Cash Balance, then the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be payable to Buyer and
shall equal the amount of such shortfall.

 

(iii) If (A) an Estimated Closing Cash Balance Deficit existed at the Closing
and (B) the Final Closing Cash Balance is _greater_ _than_ the Estimated
Closing Cash Balance, then the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be payable to the
Paying Agent (on behalf of the Sellers) and shall equal the amount of such
excess _less_ the amount, if any, by which the Final Closing Cash Balance
exceeds the Closing Cash Balance Cap.

(iv) If (A) an Estimated Closing Cash Balance Surplus existed at the Closing
and (B) the Final Closing Cash Balance is _less_ _than_ the Estimated Closing
Cash Balance, then the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be payable to Buyer and
shall equal the amount of such shortfall _less_ the amount, if any, by which
the Estimated Closing Cash Balance exceeded the Closing Cash Balance Cap;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Final Closing Cash Balance and the
Estimated Closing Cash Balance are each  _greater_ _than_ the Closing Cash
Balance Cap, then the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to equal $0.00.

(v) If (A) an Estimated Closing Cash Balance Surplus existed at the Closing
and (B) the Final Closing Cash Balance is _greater_ _than_ the Estimated
Closing Cash Balance, then the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be payable to the
Paying Agent (on behalf of the Sellers) and shall equal the amount of such
excess _less_ the amount, if any, by which the Final Closing Cash Balance
exceeds the Closing Cash Balance Cap;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Final Closing Cash Balance and the Estimated Closing Cash Balance are each
_greater_ _than_ the Closing Cash Balance Cap, then the Cash Adjustment Amount
shall be deemed to equal $0.00. 

Any Cash Adjustment Amount payable to the Sellers shall be increased by the
amount of any VAT attributable to the Seller Parties Transaction Expenses
actually recovered by the Company prior to the date of payment, if any, and
the resulting amount shall be paid by Buyer in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Paying Agent or to the account or accounts
otherwise designated by the Seller Representative in writing within three (3)
Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing Cash Balance Statement
is finally determined. Any Cash Adjustment Amount payable to Buyer shall
be decreased by the amount of any VAT attributable to the Seller Parties
Transaction Expenses actually recovered by the Company prior to the date of
payment, if any, and the resulting amount shall be set-off against the amount
of the Closing Cash Balance Set-Off Amount in accordance with _Section
2.5(b)_ of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any
Cash Adjustment Amount payable to Buyer is in excess of the Closing Cash
Balance Set-Off Amount, then any such excess shall be set-off against the
General Set-Off Amount in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ of this Agreement.

 



26 3.3 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, the Paying Agent, and the Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of the Closing Cash Payment, the
Stock Consideration, the Deferred Cash Purchase Price, amounts payable
pursuant to the Seller Note or any other amounts (or any portion thereof)
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, the ITO or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Buyer, the Paying Agent or the Company, such
withheld amounts shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding the above,
Buyer, the Paying Agent or the Company shall release any such withheld amounts
(or such applicable portion thereof) not yet remitted to the ITA to the
respective Person in accordance with a Valid Certificate provided by such
Person at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the last day on which the
amounts so withheld must be transferred to the ITA. If Buyer, the Paying
Agent or the Company so withholds amounts and pays them to the ITA with
respect to a Seller, Buyer, the Paying Agent or the Company, if so requested,
shall furnish to such Person documents evidencing such withholding and
payment. In addition, to the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer, the
Paying Agent or the Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which the withholding was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
purposes of Israeli Tax, Buyer, the Paying Agent and the Company shall not
withhold any amount pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ from payments to be made
to an employee of dbMotion, Inc., if the Person entitled to payment has
provided to Buyer, prior to making any payment payable pursuant to this
Agreement, a written instrument pursuant to which such Person represents that
he/she is not an Israeli resident.

(h) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the Holders, including,
and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders (except
with respect to any Registrable Shares that have been registered as
contemplated by this  _Section 7.7_ or otherwise and are subsequently sold
or otherwise disposed of or transferred). The Holders shall be third party
beneficiaries to this _Section 7.7_, and shall have the right to enforce the
provisions of this  _Section 7.7_ directly to the extent they may deem such
enforcement necessary or advisable to protect such Holders rights hereunder.

 



68 7.8 _Rule 144_. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or any other similar rule or
regulation of the SEC that at any time may permit the Holders to sell
Registrable Shares to the public without registration (" _Rule 144_ "),
provided that any Holder holds any Registrable Shares that are eligible for
resale under Rule 144 and such information is necessary in order for any
Holder to sell such Registrable Shares pursuant to Rule 144, Parent agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to: 

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144;

 

(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of Parent under the Exchange Act so long as Parent remains subject
to such requirements and the filing of such reports and other documents is
required in order for a Holder to rely on the applicable provisions of Rule
144; and

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Shares, furnish to such Holder,
promptly upon request, (i) a written statement as to its compliance with the
reporting requirements of Rule 144 and the Exchange Act applicable to Parent
and (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Parent and
such other reports and documents so filed by Parent as may be reasonably
requested to permit such Holder to sell Registrable Shares pursuant to Rule

permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, to fulfill and honor the
obligations of the Company (i) pursuant to the indemnification agreements
listed in _Section 4.15_ of the Disclosure Schedule with each director
and/or officer who is a party to such indemnification agreements, which
agreements shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms; and (ii) under the Companys and each
of the Company Subsidiaries Organizational Documents, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and at the Closing that provide for
indemnification of directors and officers of the Company with respect
to events occurring prior to the Closing, which obligation shall survive the
Closing with respect to such events and be observed by the Company to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements for a period of
seven (7) years from and after the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall procure a prepaid irrevocable seven (7) year "tail" policy of directors
and officers liability insurance (the " _D andO Run-Off Coverage_"),
providing coverage to those directors and officers covered by the directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company on the Closing Date
on terms not less favorable to the coverage provided by such existing
coverage.

 

7.10 _Company Plans_.

(a) [RESERVED]

(b) [RESERVED]

 

(c) Buyer shall take such action as may be necessary so that immediately
following the Closing Date (i) all U.S. employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries so employed immediately following the Closing Date shall
be provided substantially the same

 



69  employee benefits in the aggregate as those provided to similarly situated
U.S. employees of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of December 31, 2013
or termination of employment, such employees shall continue to be covered by
the Company Plans sponsored or maintained by the U.S. Company Subsidiary, on
the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to Closing, and
(ii) employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries outside the U.S. so
employed immediately following the Closing Date shall be provided, for one
year following the Closing Date, employee benefits no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date. With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Buyer in which employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries subsequently participate, for purposes of
determining eligibility and vesting and, for purposes of determining vacation
and severance entitlement, Buyer will, to the extent permitted by the
applicable Legal Requirements, plan, practice, policy or arrangement, ensure
that service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Company provides past service credit) be treated as service with Buyer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized for
purpose of accruals of benefits or to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not
recognized under the applicable Company Plan. Buyer shall cause its
health benefit plans to waive any pre-existing condition limitations on
coverage for the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted or construed to confer upon any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary any right with respect to continuance of employment by or
other service with the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Buyer or any
Subsidiary of Buyer, nor shall this Agreement interfere in any way with the
right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to terminate the employment,
engagement or other association of any employee or consultant of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary at any time, or require Buyer or any Subsidiary of
Buyer to continue the employment or services of any employee or consultant of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary following the Closing Date and (ii)
nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment of or interfere in any
way with the right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Buyer or any
Subsidiary of Buyer to amend, terminate or otherwise discontinue any or all
plans, practices or policies of the Company or Buyer in effect from time to
time, except that the Company shall assume the Companys Employee Share
Incentive Plan, 2004, as amended. Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to
provide COBRA continuation coverage under a health plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries," as such term is
defined for purposes of Treas. Reg. § 54.4980B-9.

7.11 _Magneton Transfer Approval_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Company shall
make or cause to be made all necessary filings and submissions to obtain the
Magneton Transfer Approval. Any such filings and submissions shall be in
substantial compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements and the Company
shall inform the Seller Representative of any material communication received
by the Company from the OCS in respect thereof. Each party hereto agrees to
cooperate in making all such filings and submissions, including (i) using
reasonable efforts to execute or deliver any instruments necessary to obtain
the Magneton Transfer Approval and (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize the Magneton Transfer Amount (provided that such efforts shall not
include agreeing to any arrangement that 

 



70  would interfere with the business and operations of the Company following
the Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not make any
filings or submissions with the OCS in connection with obtaining the Magneton
Transfer Approval without the consent of the Seller Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld) until the date that is thirty (30)
days following receipt by the Company of an initial response from the OCS
with respect to the Companys filings and submissions to obtain the OCS
Transfer Approval (which Buyer intends to cause the Company to submit promptly
following the Closing). If the Magneton Transfer Approval is not obtained by
the end of such thirty (30) day period, the Company shall thereafter have the
unlimited right, in its sole discretion, to make or cause to be made all
necessary filings and submissions to obtain the Magneton Transfer Approval. 

(b) In connection with obtaining the Magneton Transfer Approval pursuant to
this _Section 7.11_, the amount of any Magneton Transfer Amount paid by the
Company in respect thereof shall reduce the Magneton Set-off Amount in
accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that to the extent the Magneton Transfer Amount is in excess of the Magneton
Set-off Amount, the amount of such excess shall be paid to Buyer by the
Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by Buyer; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall have
the option to instead set-off the amount of such excess against the General
Set-Off Amount in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ of this Agreement.

7.12 _Non-Solicitation_.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the two (2)
year anniversary of the Closing Date, each Investor Seller agrees to not,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or engagement any Protected
Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that general advertisements not directed
at any such Protected Employee shall not be deemed to be a breach by an
Investor Seller of the non-solicitation restrictions set forth in this
_Section 7.12(a)_.

 

(b) If any provision of this _Section 7.12_ shall for any reason be held
invalid in part, such provision shall be modified, as to time, location or
both, only to the minimum extent required for its validity and enforceability
under applicable Legal Requirements and shall be binding and enforceable with
respect to each Seller as so modified.

 

(c) If any provision of this _Section 7.12_ or the application thereof
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of this _Section 7.12_ will continue in
full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons
or circumstances will be interpreted so as to effect the intent of the
parties hereto.

(d) Each Investor Seller acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this 
_Section 7.12_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
business interests of Buyer and its investment in the goodwill of and in the
Company. The restrictive covenants contained in this _Section 7.12_ are
covenants independent of any other provision of this Agreement or any
instrument or other document contemplated hereby between the parties, and the
existence of any claim that any Investor Seller may allege against Buyer under
any other provision of this Agreement or any instrument or other document
contemplated hereby will not prevent enforcement of these covenants. Without
limiting the remedies available to Buyer, each Investor

 



71  Seller acknowledges that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this
_Section 7.12_ will result in material irreparable injury to Buyer for which
there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure
damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or
threat thereof, Buyer shall be entitled to obtain a temporary restraining
order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, without the necessity of
proving irreparable harm or injury as a result of such breach or threatened
breach of this _Section 7.12_, restraining any Investor Seller from engaging
in activities prohibited by this _Section 7.12_ or such other relief as may
be required specifically to enforce any of the covenants in this _Section
7.12_.

7.13  _Option Tax Ruling_. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has filed
with the ITA an application for a ruling (the " _Option Tax Ruling_ ") and has
obtained from the ITA an interim Option Tax Ruling. The parties shall
use reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Legal Requirements to obtain a final Option Tax Ruling as
promptly as practicable following the Closing.

7.14 _Datasite Information_. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer and Seller Representative, or
shall cause to be delivered to Buyer and Seller Representative, compact discs
(which shall be permanent and accessible, without the need for any password,
with readily and commercially available software) containing in an electronic
format all documents posted to the electronic data site as of the Closing
maintained by Intralinks in connection with transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.15 _Unfunded Pension Set Off Amount_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing, the Company shall apply to the Israel Ministry of Trade
and Commerce to request confirmation that the Unfunded Pension and Severance
Reduction should be zero. In the event that the Companys application is
approved, in whole or in part, the amount of the Unfunded Pension Set
Off Amount shall be reduced in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the Unfunded Pension
Set Off Amount is not reduced to zero, such amount shall be paid to Buyer by
the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by Buyer; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall have
the option to instead set-off such amount against the General Set-Off Amount
in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ of this Agreement.

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each Company Indemnifying Party shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer, Parent and their respective Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Company and each Company Subsidiary) and each of
their respective successors, permitted assigns, officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified
Parties_ ") against, and reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Party for, all
Damages that such Buyer Indemnified Party may suffer or incur, or become
subject to, relating to or arising out of or in connection with any of the
following (each a " _Buyer Claim_ "):

(i) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty (other than the representations and warranties in _Section 4.10_)
made by the Company or an applicable Company Indemnifying Party in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Company or the applicable
Company Indemnifying Party to be true, complete and correct in all respects as
of the Closing Date (it being understood and agreed that for purposes of
determining the amount of Damages to which any indemnification applies, each
representation and warranty shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the terms "material" and "Material Adverse Effect" or words of
similar import);

 



76 (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by the Company or an applicable Company Indemnifying Party in this
Agreement or in any agreement or document entered into by the Company or the
applicable Company Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement,
except for a breach or non-fulfillment resulting from any action or failure
to act by Buyer or any of its Affiliates;

(iii) any fraud on the part of the Company or the applicable Company
Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement or any certificate
delivered by the Company or such Company Indemnifying Party in connection
therewith;

 

(iv) any (A) Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
(determined as provided in _Section 14.1_) or (B), any Taxes resulting from
any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or warranty
made by the Company under _Section 4.10_ (it being understood and agreed that
for purposes of determining the amount of Damages related thereto, each such
representation and warranty shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the terms "material" and "Material Adverse Effect" or words of
similar import);

(v) any Action filed against the Company or any Company Subsidiary for events
or actions occurring or arising prior to the Closing, including the matters
identified in _Section 4.22_ of the Disclosure Schedule;

(vi) any OCS Indemnity Amount or any amount of the Magneton Transfer Amount
borne by a Buyer Indemnified Party;

(vii) any amount of Seller Parties Transaction Expenses (excluding any VAT

forth in the statement delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ or (B)
not fully discharged at or prior to the Closing; and

(viii) any Unfunded Pension and Severance Reduction not otherwise borne by
the Sellers hereunder or any Liability incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party
arising from any actions taken in compliance with _Section 7.15_.

 



77 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 13.1(c)_, (i) the Company
Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless any Buyer Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Buyer
Indemnified Party for, any Damages pursuant to _Section 13.1(a)(i)_ until
the aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified Parties Damages exceeds
$2,252,316 (the " _Deductible_ "), after which the Company Indemnifying
Parties shall be obligated only for such aggregate Damages of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in excess of the Deductible and (ii) the cumulative
indemnification obligations of the Company Indemnifying Parties shall in no
case exceed $22,523,162, except for (A) the indemnification obligations under
_Sections 13.1(a)(ii) _through _(vii)_ and (B) indemnification obligations
with respect to breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations, which
shall in no case exceed $225,231,621. 

(c) The liability of each Company Indemnifying Party for indemnification
hereunder shall be joint and several;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if and
to the extent that, subject to _Section 13.1(b)_, amounts necessary to
satisfy Buyer Claims under this _Section 13.1_ exceed the General Set-Off
Amount, then the liability of the Company Indemnifying Parties under this
_Section 13.1_ for any indemnifiable Damages in excess of the General Set-Off
Amount shall be several and not joint and will be limited to each Company
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Share of such Damages. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) with respect to any Buyer Claim related to a breach by a
Company Indemnifying Party of the representations made by such party under
_Section 5_, only the Company Indemnifying Party that is in breach thereof
shall be liable for indemnification hereunder and (ii) with respect to
_Sections 7.12(a)_, only the Company Indemnifying Party in breach thereof
shall be liable for indemnification hereunder. Further, the recourse of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties against the General Set-Off Amount with respect to
any Buyer Claim against any Company Indemnifying Party relating to the
foregoing _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ , shall be limited to such Company
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Share of the General Set-Off Amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Company Indemnifying Party be liable
for indemnification obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, exceed
the value of the aggregate consideration allocated to such Company
Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

For the purposes hereof the term " _Pro Rata Share_ " means, with respect to
each Company Indemnifying Party, the quotient of (i) the value of the
consideration paid (or payable, with respect to the Seller Note, the Deferred
Cash Purchase Price or any Employee Holdback Agreement) to such Company
Indemnifying Party, _divided_ by (ii) the aggregate sum of the Closing Cash
Payment, _plus_ the amount of the Seller Note, _plus_ the amount of the Stock
Consideration,  _plus_ , the amount of the Deferred Cash Purchase Price,
_plus_ the Employee Holdback Amount paid to all Company Indemnifying Parties
(collectively, the " _Aggregate Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until such time as all holders of Options have executed an
Optionholder Letter of Transmittal, the Aggregate Consideration paid to all
Company Indemnifying Parties for purposes of clause (ii) above shall be deemed
to exclude the amounts payable to the holders of Options who have not
exercised an Optionholder Letter of Transmittal.

13.2 _Indemnification of Seller Indemnified Parties_. From and after the
Closing, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Company Indemnifying Party, its
respective Affiliates (excluding, following the 

 



78  Closing, the Company) and each of their respective successors, permitted
assigns, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and reimburse
any Seller Indemnified Party for, all Damages that such Seller Indemnified
Party may suffer or incur, or become subject to, relating to or arising out of
or in connection with any of the following: 

(a) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or in any document or certificate
delivered by Buyer under this Agreement to be true, complete and correct in
all respects as of the Closing Date; or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Buyer in this Agreement or in any agreement or document entered
into by Buyer in connection with this Agreement, except for a breach or non-
fulfillment resulting from any action or failure to act by the Sellers or any
of their respective Affiliates.

13.3 _Notification of Claims_. A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified
under this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), shall promptly notify the
party or parties liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") in writing of any pending claim, threatened claim (to the extent in
writing), demand or circumstance that the Indemnified Party has determined in
good faith has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right
of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending claim, threatened
claim (to the extent in writing), claim or demand asserted by a third party
against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _Third-Party Claim_ ")),
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim, demand or circumstance; _provided_ , that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this _Section 13 _except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure, it being
understood that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in _Section 10_ for
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

13.4 _Third-Party Claims_. Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity
from an Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 13.3_, with respect to any
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, upon agreeing in writing that
it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-
Party Claim hereunder, assume the defense and control of any Third-Party
Claim and, in the event that the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense
of such claim, it shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense (except in those instances in which a conflict of
interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, then
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable expenses of one separate
counsel selected by the Indemnified Party); _provided_ , that in no event
shall the Indemnifying Party be permitted to assume the defense of a Third-
Party Claim if the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that such Third-
Party Claim is reasonably likely to materially and adversely impact the
reputation of such Indemnified Party or one of its Affiliates. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within ten
(10) Business Days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys written
notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the
defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle
or compromise the Third-Party Claim without admitting any liability on 

 



79  the part of the Indemnifying Party, but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Person that shall control
the defense of any such Third-Party Claim (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall
select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence after consultation with the other party and shall diligently take
all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or settlement of such Third-
Party Claim. The Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnifying
Parties, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates
and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Controlling Party in
the defense of any Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be
authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third-Party Claim, so long as the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay
or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement (subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 13.1_, if applicable), (ii) not encumber
any of the material assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any
restriction or condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect
any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business,
(iii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a
complete release of any Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third-
Party Claim and (iv) obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
with respect to such settlement or judgment (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld).

13.5 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

(a) After the Closing, subject to the Closing Cash Balance adjustment
provisions set forth in _Section 3.2_, the indemnification provisions in
this _Section 13_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Company Indemnifying Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each document delivered at the Closing.
The first source of recovery and recourse for indemnification or other claims
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties related to this Agreement or any other
document delivered at the Closing shall be from the General Set-Off Amount,
the Magneton Set-Off Amount or the Closing Cash Balance Set-Off Amount, as
applicable, subject to the terms of this Agreement. The parties may not avoid
the limitations on Liability set forth in this _Section 13_ by seeking
damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of
Liability.

(b) In the event the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover the
same Damages under more than one provision of this Agreement, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall only be permitted to recover such Damages one time,
and without duplication.

 

(c) The amount of any Damages payable under this _Section 13_ shall be net of
amounts actually recovered by the Company, Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
under applicable insurance policies, indemnification provisions or otherwise.
If the Company, Buyer or any Affiliate thereof receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, indemnification provisions or
otherwise subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Company
Indemnifying Parties, then the amount of Damages to be recovered by Buyer
shall be recalculated, taking into account the limitations of this _Section
13_, as if such insurance proceeds, indemnification or other amounts had been
received prior to the collection of any Damages under this Agreement and any
excess Damages previously collected after such recalculation shall increase
the General Set-Off Amount, or after the release of the Deferred Cash
Purchase Price, such amount shall be distributed to the Company Indemnifying
Parties, based on their respective Pro Rata Share as set forth in the
Allocation Statement.

 



80 (d) The exercise of any right of set-off in good faith in accordance with 
_Section 2.5(b)_, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will
not constitute a breach under this Agreement or another other documents
contemplated hereby. Neither the exercise nor the failure to exercise such
right of set-off will constitute an election of remedies.

13.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Company
Indemnifying Parties, the Seller Representative, Parent and Buyer agree to
treat (and to cause their Affiliates to treat) any payments received pursuant
to this _Section 13_ as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Legal Requirements.

13.7 _Investigation; No Recourse Against Company_. No Indemnifying Party
shall have any right of contribution or other recourse against the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective Representatives, assigns or
successors, for any indemnification claims asserted by any Indemnified Party,
it being acknowledged and agreed that the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Company are solely for the benefit of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties.

13.8 _Definition of Damages_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Damages_ " shall mean:

(a) with respect to Buyer Indemnified Parties, 95.75% of the amount of any
loss, damage, liability, judgment, fine, penalty, cost or expense (including
reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys, consultants and
experts fees and expenses) incurred, paid, accrued or sustained by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, whether or not arising out of a Third-Party Claim,
including any reasonable costs of defending or enforcing the Buyer
Indemnified Partys rights under this Agreement, excluding all punitive
damages (except to the extent that any such punitive damages are payable in
connection with a Third-Party Claim); and

 

(b) with respect to Seller Indemnified Parties, the amount of any loss,
damage, liability, judgment, fine, penalty, cost or expense (including
reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys, consultants and
experts fees and expenses) incurred, paid, accrued or sustained by the Seller
Indemnified Parties, whether or not arising out of a Third-Party Claim,
including any reasonable costs of defending or enforcing the Buyer Indemnified
Partys rights under this Agreement, excluding all punitive damages (except to
the extent that any such punitive damages are payable in connection with
a Third-Party Claim).

SECTION 14

_TAXES_

14.1 _Straddle Period_. All Tax Returns of the Company and any Company
Subsidiary for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date (the "
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") and any Straddle Period, to the extent filed or
required to be filed after the Closing Date, shall be prepared and filed (or
caused to be filed) by Buyer. With respect to any such Tax Return relating to
income Taxes (or franchise taxes based on income), (a) Buyer will prepare (or
cause to be

 



81  prepared) such returns consistent with past practice, except as required by
applicable law and (b) Buyer shall provide Seller Representative with a copy
of such return prior to the filing thereof, and Seller Representative shall
have a reasonable opportunity (for a period of not less than twenty (20) days)
to review and comment on such return prior to filing. In any case of a taxable
period which includes the Closing Date (but does not end on that day) (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period
shall be allocated (a) to the Sellers for the period up to and including the
close of business on the Closing Date and (b) to Buyer for the period
subsequent to the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). For
purposes of such allocation, the amount of (i) any Taxes based on or measured
by income, receipts or payroll (other than payroll that is accrued but unpaid
as of the Closing Date) and (ii) any withholding Taxes (including Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld under Chapter 3 of Subtitle A of the
Code) to the extent not withheld from amounts paid, shall in each case be
allocated based on an interim closing of the books of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through
entity in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary holds a beneficial
interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) provided that any
transaction (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) that
occurs on the Closing Date and after the Closing that is not in the ordinary
course of business and is undertaken at the direction of Buyer shall be
included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. The amount of other Taxes of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary shall be apportioned to the Sellers based
on the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the
taxable period up to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

14.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Any sales, use, transfer, documentary, gains,
stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes incurred as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent (50%)
by Buyer. The person required under applicable law to file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes (the "
_Transfer Tax Returns_ ") shall timely and accurately prepare such Transfer
Tax Returns and timely pay all such Transfer Taxes; _provided_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, that Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary may seek
indemnification with respect to the Transfer Taxes for which the Sellers are
liable pursuant to the preceding sentence. If required by applicable Tax Law,
the Sellers or the Seller Representative will join in the execution of any
Transfer Tax Return.

14.3 _Section 338 Election_. Buyer may not, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, make an election under Section
338 of the Code or similar section under state, local or foreign law without
the consent of the Seller Representative in its sole discretion and only if,
upon such election, Buyer indemnifies Sellers for all Taxes incurred by them,
or for which Sellers would be liable under this Agreement or by law, as a
result of such election.

14.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with any Tax matters with respect to Buyer, the Sellers, the
Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries, including any such 

 



82  matters relating to the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, amended
Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a Tax Liability or participating
in or conducting any Tax Proceeding. All refunds for Taxes for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and any portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be paid to Sellers net of costs and expenses of obtaining
such refund (and only to the extent such amount (a) was not included in the
Closing Cash Balance as set forth in the Final Closing Cash Balance Statement
and (b) is not attributable to a tax attribute arising after the Closing Date)
after receipt from the Sellers of an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer that the Sellers shall return such amounts (together with interest and
penalties imposed by the applicable Tax Authority) that may be subsequently
claimed by the Tax Authority paying such refund. Except in connection with a
Tax matter described in _Section 14.6_, Buyer, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall not file any amended Tax Return that will increase the
Sellers liability for Taxes or for indemnification under this Agreement,
without the written consent of the Seller Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

14.5  _Dispute Resolution_. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, arising out of or
relating to the provisions of this Agreement that relates to the computation
of the amount of any Taxes for purposes of applying the provisions of this
Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiations between Buyer and the
Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall be submitted to the
Accounting Firm for resolution. The Accounting Firm shall control the
proceedings related to the dispute resolution and may request such evidence
and information as it deems necessary. The Accounting Firm shall determine (it
being understood that in making such determination, the Accounting Firm shall
be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator), based solely on written
submissions by Buyer and the Seller Representative, and not by independent
review, only those issues in dispute and shall render a written report as to
the resolution of the dispute and the resulting computation of any Tax, fee,
deduction or other amount in dispute which, absent manifest error, shall be
conclusive and binding on Buyer, the Seller Representative, the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting
Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such items claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
items claimed by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer and the Seller Representative,
on behalf of the Sellers, based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Accounting Firms determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Accounting
Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total an amount equal to $1,000
and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Seller Representatives
position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of its review would be borne by
Buyer and forty percent (40%) of such costs would be borne by the Seller
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers.

 

14.6 _Tax Claims_. This _Section 14.6_ (and not _Section 13.4_) shall
control any inquiry, assessment, proceeding or other similar event relating
to Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Seller Representative,
on behalf of the Sellers, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
represent the interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary before the
relevant Governmental Authority with respect to any inquiry, assessment,
proceeding or other similar event (a " _Tax Matter_ ") relating solely to
Taxes of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and has the right to control the
defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter,

 



83  including responding to inquiries, preparing Tax Returns and contesting,
defending against and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice
of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Tax
Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , (a) Buyer has the right (but not the
obligation) to participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Seller
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, and (b) the Seller Representative
shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax
Matter that could result in a present or future increase in Tax Liability for
Buyer, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the foregoing
for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed. Buyer has the right to represent the interests of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary before the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to any Tax Matter that does not relate solely to Taxes of any
Pre-Closing Tax Period and has the right to control the defense, compromise
or other resolution of any such Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries,
filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving any
assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Tax Matter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to a Tax Matter that could affect the liability
of any Seller pursuant to _Section 13.1_ or otherwise under this Agreement,
(i) the Seller Representative has the right (but not the obligation) to
participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from counsel employed by Buyer, and (ii) Buyer
shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax
Matter that affects the liability of any Seller for Taxes or pursuant to
_Section 13.1_ or otherwise under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Seller Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed.

SECTION 15

 

 _SELLER REPRESENTATIVE_

15.1 _Appointment of Seller Representative; Agreements Binding on the Seller
Parties_. Each of the Company Indemnifying Parties, by virtue of executing or
joining this Agreement, hereby (a) irrevocably constitutes and appoints,
effective as of the Closing, Shareholder Representative Services LLC (together
with its permitted successors, the " _Seller Representative_ "), as his, her
or its true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact, for all purposes
under this Agreement, and to exercise all or any of the powers, authority and
discretion conferred on each of him, her or it under this Agreement following
the Closing (including _Section 13_ and this _Section 15_) or any other
agreement or document entered into or delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) agrees to be bound by and comply
with, all of the obligations of the Company Indemnifying Parties set forth
herein (including _Section 13_ and this _Section 15_). The Seller
Representative agrees to act as, and to undertake the duties and
responsibilities of, such agent and attorney-in-fact. This power of attorney
is coupled with an interest, is made for the benefit of third parties and is
irrevocable and shall survive the dissolution, death or incapacity of each of
the Company Indemnifying Parties.

 



84 15.2 _Powers of the Seller Representative_.

 

(a) The Seller Representative shall have and may exercise all of the powers
specifically conferred upon it pursuant to this Agreement, which shall
include:

(i) The power to execute as Seller Representative any agreement or instrument
entered into or delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby;

(ii) The power to give or receive any notice or instruction permitted or
required under this Agreement, or any other agreement or document entered into
or executed in connection herewith, to be given or received by the Seller
Representative or any Company Indemnifying Party, and each of them (other
than notice for service of process relating to any Action before a court or
other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, which notice must be given to each
Company Indemnifying Party individually, as applicable), and to take any
and all action for and on behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties, and
each of them, under this Agreement or any other such agreement or document;

(iii) The power (subject to the provisions of _Section 15.2_ hereof) to (A)

Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification through counsel selected
by the Seller Representative and solely at the cost, risk and expense of the

and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to such Buyer Claims, (C) resolve any
Buyer Claims, (D) take any actions in connection with the resolution of any
dispute relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby by
arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and (E) take or forego any or all

in the judgment of the Seller Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement;

(iv) The power to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Company Indemnifying Parties;

(v) The power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement providing
rights or benefits to any Company Indemnifying Party in accordance with the
terms hereof and in the manner provided herein; and 

(vi) The power to take any actions on behalf of any Company Indemnifying Party
in regard to such other matters as are reasonably necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or as the Seller
Representative reasonably believes are in the best interests of the Company
Indemnifying Parties.

 



85 (b) The Seller Representative represents and warrants to Buyer that:

 

(i) The Seller Representative has all necessary power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder; and

(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Seller
Representative and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Buyer and the Seller Parties, constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Seller Representative, enforceable against
the Seller Representative in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general application
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity
principles.

 

15.3 _Closing Cash Balance Disputes; Claims by Buyer_.

(a) Upon the Seller Representatives delivery of an Objection Notice pursuant
to _Section 3.2_ or the Seller Representatives receipt or notice of any
Buyer Claim pursuant to  _Section 13.3_ or _13.4_ , the Seller
Representative shall give prompt written notice of the amount and details
thereof (to the extent of the information in its possession) to each of the
Company Indemnifying Parties.

 

(b) The Seller Representative shall have the discretion to take such action as
it shall determine to be in the best interests of all of the Company
Indemnifying Parties, taken as a whole, including authorizing the set-off of
any portion of the General Set-Off Amount in accordance with the terms,
conditions and restrictions set forth in _Section 2.5(b)_ of this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in any event, all Company
Indemnifying Parties shall be treated in substantially the same manner.

15.4 _Notices_. Any notice given to the Seller Representative will constitute
notice to each and all of the Company Indemnifying Parties at the time notice
is given to the Seller Representative. Any action taken by, or notice or
instruction received from, the Seller Representative will be deemed to be
action by, or notice or instruction from, each and all of the Company
Indemnifying Parties. Buyer and the Company will disregard any notice
or instruction received from any one or more individual Company Indemnifying
Parties.

15.5 _Agreement of the Seller Representative_. The Seller Representative
hereby agrees to do such acts, and to execute further documents, as shall be
necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement.

 

15.6 _Reimbursement and Liability of Seller Representative_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of the Sellers, shall deposit an amount
equal to the Seller Representative Expense Amount with the Seller
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Seller Representative
Expense Amount shall be held in a separate account solely for the use of the
Seller Representative to pay the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Seller Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder, including
all expenses arising in connection with claims for indemnification under
_Section 15.6(b)_ (" _Representative Expenses_ "). 

 



86  Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any right, title or
interest to the Seller Representative Expense Amount and shall not make any
claims against the Seller Representative Expense Amount under this Agreement
or otherwise. The Seller Representative may be reimbursed or reimburse any
third party for any Representative Expenses from the Seller Representative
Expense Amount. The Sellers will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Seller Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to
the Seller Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had
in any such interest or earnings. The Seller Representative will not
be liable for any loss of principal of the Seller Representative Expense
Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
As soon as practicable following the release in full of the Deferred Cash
Purchase Price, the Seller Representative will deliver the balance of the
Seller Representative Expense Amount to the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Sellers. For tax purposes, the Seller Representative
Expense Amount will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Sellers at the time of Closing.

(b) The Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Company Indemnifying
Party for any act done or omitted hereunder as Seller Representative while
acting in good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Company Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify the Seller Representative and
hold the Seller Representative and its successors and assigns harmless
against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses,
damages, obligations, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and court costs) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising as
a result of or incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by the Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in
each case as such Representative Loss is incurred or suffered; _provided_
that in the event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any
portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Seller Representative, the Seller Representative will
reimburse the Company Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Seller Representative by the Company
Indemnifying Parties, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Seller Representative from (i) the Seller Representative Expense Amount and
(ii) the amounts of the Deferred Cash Purchase Price actually distributed to
the Company Indemnifying Parties at such time as such remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Company Indemnifying Parties; _provided_
_however_ , that while this section allows the Seller Representative to be
paid from the Seller Representative Expense Amount and the Deferred Cash
Purchase Price, this does not relieve the Company Indemnifying Parties from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as
such Representative Losses are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the
Seller Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise.

15.7 _Reliance on Seller Representative_. Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company) shall be entitled to rely on the appointment
of the Seller Representative herein and to treat such Seller Representative
as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Seller and as having the
duties, power and authority provided for in this Agreement. None of Buyer nor
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) shall be liable to
any Company Indemnifying Party for any actions taken or omitted by them in
reliance upon any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the
Seller Representative. No resignation of the Seller Representative shall
become effective unless at least thirty (30) days prior written

 



87  notice of the replacement or resignation of such Seller Representative shall
be provided to Buyer. Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company) shall be entitled to rely at any time after receipt of any such
notice on the most recent notice so received. If the Seller Representative
shall be unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, its successor who
shall serve and exercise the powers of the Seller Representative hereunder
shall be appointed by a written instrument signed by Company Indemnifying
Parties holding a majority interest in the Deferred Cash Purchase Price.

SECTION 16

_RELEASE_

 

16.1 _Release_. The Sellers, in their capacity as shareholders of the Company
and in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of or consultants
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, effective as of the
Closing Date and subject to the Closing, shall be deemed to have, and hereby
do, unconditionally release and forever discharge the Company, each Company
Subsidiary, Buyer and any Affiliate of Buyer including their respective
officers, directors and employees (the " _Released Parties_ "), from (i) any
and all obligations or duties the Company or any Company Subsidiary
might have to each of the Sellers and (ii) any and all claims of liability,
whether legal or equitable, of every kind and nature, which each of the
Sellers ever had, now has or may claim against the Released Parties, in each
case arising out of facts or circumstances occurring at any time on or prior
to the date hereof (the " _Released Claims_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Released Claims shall exclude any right of any Seller to enforce this
Agreement and with respect to wages or employee benefits accrued as of the
Closing arising from or in connection with such Sellers employment by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing. It is the intention of
the Sellers in executing this Agreement and in giving and receiving the
consideration called for herein that the release contained in this _Section
16.1_ shall be effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction and
general release of claims and from all Released Claims and the final
resolution by such Seller and the Released Parties of all Released Claims.
Each Seller hereby represents to Buyer, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary that such Seller has not voluntarily or involuntarily assigned or
transferred or purported to assign or transfer to any Person any Released
Claims and that no Person other than such Seller has any interest in any
Released Claim by Legal Requirement or contract by virtue of any action or
inaction by such Seller. The invalidity or unenforceability of any part of
this _Section 16.1_ shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of this _Section 16.1_, which shall remain in full force and
effect. Apart from the claims above expressly excepted from this general
release, the Released Claims include all other claims even if the claims and
their existence are unknown or not suspected, and even if knowledge of those
claims would have affected the acceptance of this general release. 

16.2 _Specific Term of Agreement_. The terms and conditions of this _Section
16_ constitute essential terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the
execution of this Agreement by the Sellers shall constitute the express
agreement of each such party to be bound by such terms and provisions.

All such notices, requests, demands, consents and other communications shall
be deemed to have been duly given or sent three (3) days following the date on
which mailed, or one (1) day following the date mailed if sent by overnight
courier, or on the date on which delivered by hand or by facsimile or e-mail
transmission (electronic receipt confirmed), as the case may be, and addressed
as aforesaid. Any notice to be given to any Sellers hereunder following the
Closing shall be given to the Seller Representative or, if for any reason
there ceases to be a Seller Representative, to each Seller; _provided_ , that
prior to there ceasing to be a Seller Representative, the Seller
Representative or the Sellers shall provide Buyer with contact information for
each Seller for purposes of notices delivered hereunder.

17.2 _Successors and Assigns_. All covenants and agreements and other
provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the
parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs
and permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. None of the
parties may assign, transfer or delegate any of their respective rights or
obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without
the consent in writing of Buyer and the Seller Representative; _provided_ ,
that Buyer may, without obtaining the prior written consent of any Person,
assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement to (a) any Affiliate of Buyer or (b) any successor of such party by
merger, by purchase of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of
Buyer or otherwise, _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall remain
responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and any
breach by any Buyer assignee, including with respect to the payment of the
Closing Cash Payment, the delivery of the Stock Consideration, payment
obligations under the Seller Note and payment of the Deferred Cash Purchase
Price. The Seller Representative shall execute such acknowledgments of
such assignments in such forms reasonably satisfactory to the Seller
Representative as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request. Any
purported assignment or delegation of rights or obligations in violation of
this _Section 17.2_ is void and of no force or effect.

 



90 17.3 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
the parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, and any such invalidity,
illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party). If any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such court has the power to fashion and
enforce another provision (instead of the provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and carries out
the intentions of the parties hereto under this Agreement and, in the event
that such court does not exercise such power, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision (instead
of the provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that is valid,
legal and enforceable and carries out the parties intentions to the greatest
lawful extent under this Agreement.

17.4 _Third Parties_. Except as specifically set forth or referred to herein,
nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their
permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement
executed in connection herewith, nor be relied upon other than by the parties
hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. The Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties not party hereto are entitled to
the rights and remedies of third party beneficiaries with respect to 
_Section 13_.

17.5 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all
matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with any matter which is the
subject of this Agreement, including the validity hereof and the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to
the conflicts-of-laws provisions thereof). The parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of
competent civil jurisdiction sitting in the State of Delaware over any Action
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or related to any matter which is the subject of this
Agreement and each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect of such Action may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waive any objection which they may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of such Action brought in such court or any claim
that such Action brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in such Action may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by any applicable Legal Requirement. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably consents to process being served by any party to
this Agreement in any Action by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 17.1_ and consents to the exercise of jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of Delaware over it and its properties with respect
to any Action, suit or proceeding arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the enforcement of
any rights under this Agreement.

 



91 17.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

17.7 _Entire Agreement; Not Binding Until Executed_. This Agreement,
including the Disclosure Schedule, Exhibits and the other agreements referred
to herein, is complete, and all promises, representations, understandings,
warranties and agreements with reference to the subject matter hereof, and
all inducements to the making of this Agreement relied upon by all the parties
hereto, have been expressed herein or in such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules,
Exhibits or such other agreements and this Agreement, including
such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and such other agreements
attached hereto, supersede any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements
or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, to the extent
they related in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof is binding upon or
enforceable against any party hereto unless and until the same is executed and
delivered by all of the parties hereto. 

17.8 _Amendments; No Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed by Buyer and the Seller
Representative. No course of dealing and no failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice
such partys rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of the parties
to this Agreement to require the performance of a term or obligation under
this Agreement or the waiver by any of the parties to this Agreement of any
breach hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or
obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single
or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy.

17.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. Certain information is contained in the
Disclosure Schedule solely for informational purposes, may not be required to
be disclosed pursuant hereto and will not imply that such information or any
other information is required to be disclosed. Inclusion of such information
will not establish any level of materiality or similar threshold or be an
admission that any of such information is material to the business, assets,
Liabilities, financial position, operations or results of operations of any
Person or otherwise material regarding such Person. Each matter disclosed in
any section of the Disclosure Schedule or set forth herein as an exception to
a representation or warranty in a manner that makes its relevance to one or
more other sections of the Disclosure Schedule, representations or warranties
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure or exception will be deemed
to have been appropriately disclosed against or qualified for in each such
other section of the Disclosure Schedule, representation and warranty
notwithstanding the presence or absence of any cross-reference in or to any
section of the Disclosure Schedule, representation or warranty.

 



92 17.10 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be
irreparably harmed in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to seek to enforce specifically the
performance by such first party under this Agreement, and each party to this
Agreement hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the other
parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no
opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific
performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post
any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies
described in this _Section 17.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties to this Agreement
may elect to pursue.

 

17.11 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and have been (or had and
voluntarily waived the opportunity to be) represented by their own legal
counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
with the opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from such
counsel. In the event any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement is to be construed as jointly drafted by the parties
hereto and no presumption or burden of proof is to arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is
inconsistent with any prior draft hereof.

17.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

17.13 _Electronic Transmission_. The exchange of signature pages to this
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile transmission or other
electronic transmission shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

17.14 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent hereby unconditionally and absolutely
guarantees to the Sellers the prompt and full payment and performance of all
covenants, agreements and other obligations of the Buyer or its assignees
hereunder, under the Paying Agent Agreement and other agreements or
instruments contemplated hereby to which Buyer is a party (the "
_Other Agreements_ "). The foregoing guarantee shall be direct, absolute,
irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be impaired irrespective of any
assignment, modification, waiver, release, supplement, extension or other
change in the terms of all or any of the obligations of the Buyer hereunder
or under any of the Other Agreements for any other reason whatsoever. Parent
and the Buyer hereby waive any requirement of promptness, diligence or notice
with respect to the foregoing guaranty and any requirement that the Sellers
exhaust any right or take any action against Parent or the Buyer in respect of
any of their obligations hereunder or under any of the Other Agreements or
otherwise. The parties hereto agree that any third party beneficiaries to
this Agreement and any other parties to the Other Agreements shall be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement and shall be entitled to rely on, and
shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of, this _Section 17.14_.
