                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 23, 2004, by and among
Luxottica Group S.p.A., an Italian corporation ("Parent"), Colorado Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and Cole National Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

      WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement, which contemplates
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, as set forth below (the
"Merger"), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement;

      WHEREAS, upon the consummation of the Merger, each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company (each a "Share"
and collectively, the "Shares") will be converted into the right to receive
$22.50 per share in cash (without interest) (the "Merger Price"), upon the terms
and subject to the limitations and conditions of this Agreement;

      WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, the Company has executed and delivered to
HAL International N.V., a Netherlands Antilles corporation ("HAL"), a waiver
(the "HAL Standstill Waiver"), a copy of which has been delivered to Parent,
pursuant to which the Company has waived certain of the provisions of the
Standstill Agreement, dated as of November 22, 1999 (as it may thereafter have
been amended, the "HAL Standstill Agreement"), between the Company and HAL, on
the terms and subject to the limitations specified therein;

      WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, concurrently herewith, Larry Pollock ("Pollock") has entered into an
agreement (the "Pollock Voting Agreement") with Parent and Merger Sub to vote
his Shares in favor of this Agreement and the Merger on the terms and subject to
the limitations specified therein;

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has approved
the terms of the Pollock Voting Agreement;

      WHEREAS, the Board is recommending that the Company's stockholders approve
this Agreement and the Merger;

      WHEREAS, the Board has taken such action as is necessary so that the
restrictions on transactions with "interested stockholders" set forth in Section
203 of the DGCL (the "Interested Stockholder Statute") and Article TENTH of the
Company's certificate of incorporation do not apply and will not apply to
Parent, Merger Sub or affiliates or associates of Parent or Merger Sub as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Pollock Voting
Agreement; and

      WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

<PAGE>

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     Section 1.01. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement and the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.02), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. Following
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. At the option
of Parent and provided that such amendment does not delay the Effective Time,
the Merger may be structured so that the Company shall be merged with and into
Merger Sub or another direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, with
Merger Sub or such other Subsidiary of Parent continuing as the Surviving
Corporation, or that another direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall be merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the
Surviving Corporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (y) the Company shall be deemed
not to have breached any of its representations and warranties herein which,
absent such election, would not have been breached, and (z) such election would
not adversely affect in any manner the Company or the stockholders of the
Company. As a condition to such election, the parties (and such additional
Subsidiary) shall execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to
reflect such election.

     Section 1.02. EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING. The closing (the "Closing") will be
held at the offices of Winston & Strawn, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York at
10:00 A.M., New York, New York time, on the fifth business day following the
date of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions),
or such other place and time as Parent and the Company may agree (the "Closing
Date"). On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by,
and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of Delaware law. The
Merger shall become effective at such time at which such Certificate of Merger
shall be duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such later time reflected in such Certificate of Merger as shall be agreed by
Parent and Company (the time that such Merger becomes effective, the "Effective
Time").

     Section 1.03. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

CORPORATION.

     (a) At the Effective Time, the restated certificate of incorporation of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended
and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto
and incorporated by reference herein, and, as so amended and restated, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable law.

     (b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to read
in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated by
reference herein, and, as so amended and restated, shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and hereof and applicable law.

     Section 1.05. DIRECTORS. Subject to applicable law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

     Section 1.06. OFFICERS. The individuals specified by Parent in writing to
the Company at least two business days prior to the Closing Date shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

     Section 1.07. CONVERSION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub, any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub, in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company, which Shares, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no
payment being made with respect thereto, and other than any Shares constituting
Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive in cash the Merger Price. At the Effective Time, all Shares
that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Price as provided
in this Section 1.07 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist
and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Price, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with Article II
hereof.

     Section 1.08. CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

     Section 1.09. DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the holder of which (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing, (ii) has demanded its rights to appraisal in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, and (iii) has not effectively withdrawn
or lost its rights to appraisal (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Price. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall
represent the right to receive only those rights provided under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares withdraws, loses or
fails to perfect its rights to appraisal, then (i) such Dissenting Shares shall
be treated as if they had been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Price as of the Effective Time and (ii) such holder shall also be entitled to
those rights (without duplication) granted under Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any written demands for
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL and any withdrawals of such demands, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, offer to settle or
make any payment with respect to such demands unless it receives prior written
consent from Parent.

     Section 1.10. COMPANY STOCK-BASED ARRANGEMENTS.

     (a) COMPANY OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, all outstanding and
unexpired options and similar rights to acquire Shares (other than Company
Stock-Based Awards and rights to acquire Shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase
Plan, as such terms are defined in Section 1.10(b) and Section 1.10(c) below),
regardless of whether or not such options or rights have vested (the "Company
Options"), including, without limitation, Company Options granted pursuant to
the Company's (i) 1992 Management Stock Option Plan, (ii) 1993 Management Stock
Option Plan, as amended, (iii) 1996 Management Stock Option Plan, (iv) Amended
and Restated 1998 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, (v) 1999 Broad-Based
Employee Stock Plan, and (vi) Amended and Restated Nonqualified Stock Option
Plan for Nonemployee Directors, as amended (collectively, the "Option Plans"),
shall be cancelled and each holder of a cancelled Company Option shall be
entitled to receive, at the Effective Time, in consideration for the
cancellation of each such Company Option, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (x) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Price over the
exercise price per Share subject to such Company Option, payable to such holder,
without interest thereon.

     (b) COMPANY STOCK-BASED AWARDS. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof: (i) all
restricted stock units, if any, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the Company's 1999 Broad-Based Employee Stock Plan that shall not yet
have been replaced by issued Shares upon the lapse of the applicable forfeiture
condition, and (ii) all rights to receive Shares in lieu of fees for service as
a director of the Company, if any, outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company's Non-Employee Director and Employee Deferred
Compensation Plan that shall not yet have been replaced by issued Shares (such
restricted stock units and rights to receive Shares referred to in clauses (i)
and (ii) are referred to herein as "Company Stock-Based Awards"), shall be
cancelled and each holder of a cancelled Company Stock-Based Award shall be
entitled to

                                      - 4 -

<PAGE>

receive, at the Effective Time, in consideration for the cancellation of such
Company Stock-Based Award, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Stock-Based Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Price, payable to such holder, without
interest thereon. All dividend equivalents, if any, credited to the account of
each holder of a Company Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall be
distributed to the holder of such Company Stock-Based Award at the Effective
Time, payable to such holder, without interest thereon.

     (c) STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. At the Effective Time, the Company's Amended
and Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock Purchase Plan") shall
be cancelled and each participant therein shall be entitled to receive, in lieu
of any other amounts otherwise payable to such participant under the Stock
Purchase Plan with respect to the then current Offering Period (as defined
therein), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of whole and
fractional Shares, if any, that would have been, but shall not yet have been,
purchased for such participant pursuant to Section 9 of the Stock Purchase Plan
in connection with a change of control of the Company (as defined therein) and
(y) the Merger Price, without interest thereon.

     (d) RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. Any restrictions on each Share
("Restricted Share") issued under any of the Plans (as defined in Section
3.12(a) below) or otherwise shall lapse immediately prior to, and effective upon
the occurrence of, the Effective Time, and each Restricted Share shall be fully
vested in each holder thereof at such time, and each such Restricted Share will
be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be
subject to the same conditions (including the condition set forth in Section
2.01(f)) as, each Share not subject to any restrictions. All dividend
equivalents, if any, credited to the account of each holder of a Restricted
Share as of the Effective Time shall be distributed to the holder of such
Restricted Share at the Effective Time.

     (e) ACTIONS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver
to the holders of Company Options and Company Stock-Based Awards and each
participant in the Stock Purchase Plan appropriate notices, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders' rights
pursuant to this Agreement. The Company shall take all action as is necessary
prior to the Effective Time to terminate all Option Plans and the Stock Purchase
Plan (including such actions as are necessary to amend each Option Plan and the
Stock Purchase Plan to cancel the Company Options, Company Stock-Based Awards
and other rights granted pursuant to such Option Plan or Stock Purchase Plan) so
that at and after the Effective Time, no current or former employee, director,
consultant or other person shall have any option to purchase or right to receive
any Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards, or shall be entitled under
the Stock Purchase Plan to require the Company to purchase Shares for his or her
benefit. Not more than ten nor less than three business days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list, in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, of (x) the number of Company Options and
Company Stock-Based Awards expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the names of the holders thereof and (y) the number of
Shares expected to be issuable pursuant to the Stock Purchase Plan as of the
Effective Time and the names of the participants in the Stock Purchase Plan to
whom such Shares are issuable, in each case together with the applicable
addresses, tax identification numbers and other information relating to such
holders and participants as Parent may reasonably require in connection with the
payments to be made pursuant to this Section 1.10. Parent may take such

                                      - 5 -

<PAGE>

actions, as promptly as practicable, prior to making any payment under this
Section 1.10, as are reasonably necessary and appropriate in order to verify the
right of any person to receive such a payment hereunder, the identifying
information relating to such person and whether any withholding is required with
respect thereto and, if so, the amount thereof.

                                   ARTICLE II

                               PAYMENT FOR SHARES

     Section 2.01. PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, a bank or trust company
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company shall act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") in effecting the payment of the Merger Price in respect of
certificates (the "Share Certificates") that, prior to the Effective Time,
represented Shares entitled to payment of the Merger Price pursuant to Section
1.07. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a paying agent
agreement with the Paying Agent in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent the aggregate
Merger Price to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 1.07 (such funds being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). Parent shall be obligated to, from time to time, deposit any
additional funds necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Price with respect to
Shares outstanding at the Effective Time.

     (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to, mail to each record holder of Share
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
(other than Share Certificates representing Shares held by Parent or Merger Sub,
any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of the
Company or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and other than
Dissenting Shares) a form of letter of transmittal, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Share Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Share Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
instructions for use in surrendering such Share Certificates and receiving the
aggregate Merger Price in respect thereof. Upon the surrender of each such Share
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such additional agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Share Certificate shall be paid the Merger
Price multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by such Share
Certificate in consideration therefor, and such Share Certificate shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each such Share Certificate (other
than Share Certificates representing Shares held by Parent or Merger Sub, by any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of the Company
or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and other than Dissenting
Shares) shall represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger Price
relating thereto. No interest or dividends shall be paid or accrued on the
Merger Price. If the Merger Price (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to
any person other than the person in whose name the Share Certificate formerly
representing Shares surrendered therefor is registered, it shall be a condition
to such right to receive such Merger Price that the Share

                                      - 6 -

Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the person surrendering such Share Certificate shall
pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Price to a person other than the registered holder of the
Share Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

     (c) Promptly following the date which is 180 days after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash,
Share Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agent's duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Share Certificate formerly representing
a Share may surrender such Share Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and,
subject to the applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws, receive
in exchange therefor the aggregate consideration relating thereto, without any
interest or dividends thereon, as provided in this Agreement.

     (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of any Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Share Certificates formerly
representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, they shall be surrendered and cancelled in exchange for the payment of
the aggregate consideration as provided in this Agreement.

     (e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of the Shares, Company Options,
Company Stock-Based Awards or other securities for any consideration to be paid
in the Merger delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     (f) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options,
Company Stock-Based Awards or other securities such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares, Company Options, Company Stock-Based Awards or other
securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

     (g) If any Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Share Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate, the
Merger Price, without any interest thereon.

     (h) The Paying Agent shall invest the funds constituting the Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be paid to Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub,
except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub prior to the date of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and identified as such by the Company (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), that:

     Section 3.01. ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES. The Company is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the number of shares of capital stock or other equity interests owned
by the Company and its Subsidiaries in its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined
below) and the number of shares held by the Company in Pearle Europe B.V. and
the percentage of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of each such person represented by such shares. Each of
the Company's Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company (as defined below). The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has the requisite power (corporate or otherwise) and authority to
own, operate or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
properties owned, operated or leased by it makes such qualification, licensing
or good standing necessary, except where the failure to have such power or
authority or to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The term "Subsidiary," as used in this Agreement, means, with respect to any
entity, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with
such entity for financial reporting purposes. The term "Significant Subsidiary,"
as used in this Agreement, shall, as to the Subsidiaries of the Company, have
the meaning set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, as determined for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003, and shall
also include certain Subsidiaries of the Company that are not covered by such
definition but are specified as "Significant Subsidiaries" in Section 3.01 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation and principal line of
business of each Subsidiary of the Company and identifies each Subsidiary that
is a Significant Subsidiary. The term "Material Adverse Effect on the Company,"
as used in this Agreement, means any change or effect that is or would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, financial
condition or revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
except for any such effects or changes arising out of or relating to (i) the
announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or

                                      - 8 -

actions by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company required to be taken pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) changes in general economic or political conditions or the
securities markets, (iii) changes in laws, rules, regulations or orders of any
Governmental Entity (as defined herein) or interpretations thereof by any
Governmental Entity or changes in accounting rules, (iv) changes affecting
generally the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries conduct
business, (v) the termination or failure to renew the license agreement to
operate optical departments in Target Stores, whether at the end of the current
contract term or following any extensions or renewals thereof, provided the
costs and expenses related thereto are not materially greater than the estimates
disclosed in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended November 1, 2003, (vi) the SEC Investigation Matters (as defined herein),
including any settlement, compromise or consent made in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement or the entry of any order or decree in connection
therewith or (vii) the case entitled People of the State of California v. Cole
National Corporation, et. al. or related cases (the "California Litigation
Matters"), including any settlement, compromise or consent made in compliance
with the terms of this Agreement, but excluding any other settlement, compromise
or consent or any change or effect arising out of or relating to any other
judgment, order or decree in connection therewith.

     Section 3.02. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent and Merger Sub an accurate and complete copy
of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to the date
hereof, of the Company. Such certificate of incorporation and by-laws are in
full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision of its
certificate of incorporation or by-laws.

of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' present or former employees
pursuant to, any of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' existing Employee

of their respective officers, employees, counsel, accountants, financial
advisors, representatives and agents (collectively, the "Company
Representatives") to, provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
officers, employees, counsel, advisors, accountants, financial advisors,
financial sources and representatives (collectively, the "Parent
Representatives") reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the offices and other facilities and to the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as will permit Parent and Merger
Sub to make inspections of such as either of them may reasonably require, and
shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Company Representatives and the
Company's Subsidiaries to furnish Parent, Merger Sub and Parent Representatives
to the extent reasonably available with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business and operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as Parent and Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably
request; PROVIDED that such access and inspections shall not unreasonably

otherwise in accordance with the terms of

                                     - 28 -

<PAGE>

September 18, 2003 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality

terms of any confidentiality obligation by which it is bound, or cause
forfeiture of attorney/client privilege; PROVIDED, that in any case where the
Company is relying on this sentence in not providing all or any of the
information or access requested by Parent, it shall promptly inform Parent
and/or the relevant Parent Representative of its reliance on this exception and
indicate in such notice the specific reason for such reliance.

     (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give to Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Effective Time.

     Section 5.03. FURTHER ASSURANCES; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and to applicable
legal requirements, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, in the case of the Company, consistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board with the advice of the Company's outside counsel, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, as promptly as practicable,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

     (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance
relating to either the Company or Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, is discovered by the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, and which should be set forth in an amendment to the Proxy Statement, the
discovering party will promptly inform the other party of such event or
circumstance. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, including
the execution of additional instruments, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary or desirable action.

     (c) Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each other in taking, or
causing to take, at the direction of Parent, all actions necessary to delist the
Shares from The New York Stock Exchange, provided that such delisting shall not
be effective until after the Effective Time.

     Section 5.04. FILINGS; CONSENTS.

     (a) Upon the terms and conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its best efforts to obtain as promptly
as practicable all Consents of any Governmental Entity or any other person
required in connection with, and waivers of any breaches or violations of any
Contracts, permits, licenses or other agreements that may be caused by, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, by (i) filing, or causing to be filed, a Notification and
Report Form and related material required under the HSR Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this

                                     - 29 -

<PAGE>

Agreement but, in any event, unless specifically agreed otherwise by the Company
and Parent, no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, and by using its best efforts to be able to certify, and to certify,
as soon as reasonably practicable, its substantial compliance with any such
requests for additional information or documentary material that may be made
under the HSR Act, unless Parent and the Company mutually determine that it is
reasonable under the circumstances not to comply substantially with any requests
for additional information and documentary material under the HSR Act, (ii)
promptly making all other required filings or submissions to Governmental
Entities, including, without limitation, filings under the Required Franchise
Laws, (iii) cooperating with one another in (A) determining whether any other
filings are required to be made with, or Consents, permits, authorizations or
approvals are required to be obtained from, any third party, the United States
government or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such
Consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iv) seeking to avoid the entry
of, or seeking to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment
that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including, without
limitation, by defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
any court by any person and (v) taking, or causing to be taken, all other
actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible, and in any event no later than the Final
Termination Date (as defined in Section 7.01(b)), provided that the Company
shall not be required to obtain (x) any Consent from any person other than
Governmental Entities unless Parent reimburses the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such Consent or (y) the Consent of
the Company's senior lenders or of the holders of Cole National Group's 8-7/8%
Senior Subordinated Notes or 8-5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes; provided, further
that the Company shall not pay or agree to pay any fee or other similar charge
to any such person in order to obtain its Consent without the prior written
approval of Parent not to be unreasonably withheld. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all such
actions, including, without limitation (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, after the Effective Time, of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit
or would limit Parent's or its Subsidiaries' (including, after the Effective
Time, the Company's and its Subsidiaries' as Subsidiaries of Parent) freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of their
respective businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required
in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
Closing; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to take any such
action, and the failure to do so shall not be deemed to be a failure to exercise
its best efforts as required by the preceding sentence, if: (i) such action
would require the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent (whether alone or together with businesses, product lines or
assets of the Company) that accounted for more than $55 million in consolidated
net revenues of Parent, or (ii) subject to clause (i), such action would require
the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines or assets of
the Company alone, or of the Company and Parent, that accounted for more

                                     - 30 -

<PAGE>

than $110 million in consolidated net revenues of the Company alone, or of the
Company and Parent in the aggregate, as the case may be, during, for each of
clause (i) and (ii), the most recently completed period of four consecutive
fiscal quarters of Parent or the Company, as the case may be. The Company shall
take such of the foregoing actions as Parent may request, provided that any such
action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall propose, negotiate, or commit to any such
sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets, businesses or product
lines without Parent's prior written consent.

     (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other informed of
any material communication, and provide to the other copies of all
correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any Government Entity relating
to this Agreement and shall permit the other to review any material
communication to be given by it to, and shall consult with the other in advance
of any telephone calls, meetings or conferences with, any Government Entity and,
to the extent permitted, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such telephone calls, meetings and conferences.

     Section 5.05. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release announcing
the terms of this Agreement shall be a joint press release. Thereafter, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company each agree to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, agree to provide to the other party
for review a copy of any such press release or public statement, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation and review, unless required by applicable law or any listing
agreement with a securities exchange.

     Section 5.06. INDEMNIFICATION; EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

     (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification now existing in favor
of any individual who at or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who, at request
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (together with such
individual's heirs, executors or administrators, the "Indemnified Parties") as
provided in the certificates of incorporation and by-laws of the Company and its
Subsidiaries existing and in effect on the date hereof and/or indemnification
agreements existing and in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger,
and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six
years from the Effective Time (or, with respect to any indemnification
agreement, the term of such indemnification agreement, if such term is less than
six years) unless otherwise required by law, and the indemnification provisions
of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and
the Subsidiaries of the Company and such indemnification agreements shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified, PROVIDED that in the event any claim or
claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
final disposition of any and all such claims. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause Luxottica U.S. Holdings to assume, be jointly and severally
liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for,

                                     - 31 -

<PAGE>

and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.06.

     (b) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than
six years (except as provided in the last proviso of this Section 5.06(b)) from
the Effective Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company; PROVIDED that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are not materially less advantageous to the beneficiaries of
the current policies and with carriers having an A.M. Best "key rating" of A X
or better, provided that such substitution shall not result in any gaps or
lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, and PROVIDED FURTHER that the Surviving Corporation shall first use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from such carriers a so-called "tail" policy
providing such coverage and being effective for the full six year period
referred to above, and shall be entitled to obtain such coverage in annual
policies from such carriers only if it is unable, after exerting such efforts
for a reasonable period of time, to obtain such a "tail" policy; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the date hereof as set forth in Section 5.06(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (or, in the case of a "tail" policy obtained pursuant to the preceding
proviso, shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium therefor in excess of
an amount equal to six times 200% of such last annual premium) and, if the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section
5.06(b), it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual
premium (or an aggregate premium, as the case may be) equal to such maximum
amount.

     (c) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section. It is expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall
be third party beneficiaries of Section 5.06(a) and Section 5.06(b) above, and
of this Section 5.06(c).

     (d) For a period of two years following the Closing Date (the
"Continuation Period"), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
employees and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
those employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) as of the
Effective Time ("Employees") with benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate, determined on a group rather than an individual basis, as those
provided under the Company's Employee Benefit Arrangements (other than those
related to the equity securities of the Company and compensation and, except as
specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, retention and incentive
compensation arrangements) in effect at the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that nothing herein shall prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any specific plan, program, policy, practice or arrangement, or
require that the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the
securities of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or interfere with the
Surviving Corporation's right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to comply with applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the

                                     - 32 -

<PAGE>

contrary set forth herein, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason for
which the Company could have terminated such person prior to the Effective Time.

     (e) Parent and its affiliates shall honor all Employee Benefit
Arrangements (including, without limitation, any severance, change of control
and similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for such changes made to any
Employee Benefit Arrangement between the date hereof and the Effective Time
other than in compliance with the terms of this Agreement), subject to any
amendment or termination thereof after the Effective Time that may be permitted
by the terms thereof, and except that Parent and its affiliates shall be
permitted to amend or terminate any plan, program, policy, practice or
arrangement as permitted pursuant to the proviso in the first sentence in
Section 5.06(d) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing or Section 5.06(d),
however: (i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, during the
Continuation Period, all Employees who suffer a termination of employment with
severance benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to
such Employees under the Company's Severance Programs, as described in the
memorandum dated October 28, 2003 delivered by the Company's outside counsel to
Parent's and Merger Sub's outside counsel, a copy of which is set forth in
Section 5.06(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, consisting of the Severance
Schedule, the Cole Employees Severance Pay Plan, as amended and restated
effective November 17, 1994, and the references to "case by case," Canadian law
and the program in Puerto Rico, referred to therein or annexed thereto; and (ii)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the New Bonus Plan and the
Retention Plan referred to in Sections 5.06(h) and Section 5.06(j),
respectively.

     (f) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and
its affiliates providing benefits to any Employees after the Effective Time (the
"New Plans"), each Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (including
predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and
its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as
such Employee was entitled, as at the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar or comparable plans (except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of accrual of benefits in whole or in part). In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a similar or comparable plan in which such Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Employee, Parent shall with respect
to fully insured programs use its best efforts to, and with respect to
self-insured programs shall, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Employee
and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements, as well as all maximums or caps with respect
to number of visits or annual or lifetime dollar limitations,

                                     - 33 -

<PAGE>

applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid or such visits occurred in accordance
with such New Plan.

     (g) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of any of the plans, contracts or agreements included
in the Company's Employee Benefit Arrangements, will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

     (h) The Company shall establish a bonus plan for its fiscal year
beginning February 1, 2004 (the "New Bonus Plan"), for its management employees,
on terms and conditions substantially similar to those applicable to its bonus
plan for its fiscal year ending January 31, 2004 (the "Existing Bonus Plan"),
with targets and levels of potential payment with reference to such targets that
are created and applied in a manner substantially similar to that applicable to
the targets and levels of potential payments as are in effect under the Existing
Bonus Plan, providing for payments not more frequently than semi-annually, based
on targets for six-month periods, and appropriate adjustments for the full year,
all as reflected in and as required by the specific terms of the New Bonus Plan
set forth in Section 5.06(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including,
without limitation, the maximum specified therein for the aggregate amounts paid
or payable thereunder by the Company and the Surviving Corporation for the
twelve-month period ending January 31, 2005.

     (i) For the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the matching
contribution formula as established under the Company 401(k) Plan for such plan
year to remain in effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any discretionary
contributions under the Company 401(k) Plan for such plan year shall be made
only if targets based on the Company's earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, determined in January 2004 by agreement between
Parent and the Company using the same criteria that were used to determine such
targets for 2003, are met; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the aggregate amount
of discretionary matching contributions for such plan year shall not in any
event exceed the amount specified in Section 5.06(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. For so long after the Effective Time as the Surviving Corporation
maintains the Company 401(k) Plan or Parent maintains a 401(k) plan with a loan
feature for similarly situated employees, Parent shall cause the Company 401(k)
Plan to retain the loan feature of such plan.

     (j) Parent agrees to honor, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor, the retention plan (the "Retention Plan") for certain employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries described in Section 5.06(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

     Section 5.07. NO SOLICITATION.

     (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives and its
directors to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also will promptly request
each person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal and in connection
with which discussions are taking place, or have taken place during the twelve
(12) month period preceding the date of this

                                     - 34 -

<PAGE>

Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by the Company or
on the Company's behalf.

     (b) The Company agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, it shall
not, directly or indirectly, and shall not permit or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company Representatives or
any of its directors to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or assistance)
the making of any proposal or offer concerning an Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any non-public
information or data to any person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal, whether
made before or after the date of this Agreement unless, after the date hereof,
(A) the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written proposal that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (B) the Board in good faith reasonably
determines, after consultation with its independent financial advisors, that
such Acquisition Proposal may reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Acquisition Proposal, (C) the Board determines in good faith that such action is
necessary in order for its directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under
applicable law, (D) the Company (x) shall have provided at least 48 hours'
advance written notice to Parent that it intends to take such action, together
with the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal and the terms
and conditions of such proposal and (y) shall have received from such person an
executed customary confidentiality agreement containing terms no less stringent
in all material respects, than those terms contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, including, in any event, a prohibition on such person from purchasing
or otherwise acquiring any capital stock of the Company while such person is
engaged in negotiations with the Company, provided that the Company shall
promptly notify Parent if and when such prohibition is no longer in effect;
PROVIDED, that such confidentiality agreement shall not contain any exclusivity
provision or other term that would prevent the Company from consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (E) the Company shall have made
available to Parent the same nonpublic information being furnished to such
person; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the
Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company as, in the good faith judgment of
the Board (after consultation with outside counsel), is required by its
fiduciary duties or under applicable law. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any material amendments or revisions to any such Acquisition Proposal.

     (c) The Board (or any committee thereof) shall not (i) withdraw,
modify or change, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or change, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.08)
other than as permitted pursuant to Section 5.07(e), (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "Acquisition Agreement") unless (A) the
Board has received an Acquisition Proposal which it has reasonably determined in
good faith (after having consulted with outside legal counsel and its
independent financial advisors) is a Superior Acquisition Proposal and that it
is necessary for the Board to terminate this Agreement or withdraw, modify or
change the Company Board Recommendation in order for its directors to comply
with their fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) the Company has notified
Parent in writing of the terms of the Superior Acquisition Proposal and the
determinations described in

                                     - 35 -

<PAGE>

clause (A) above and of its intent to take such action, and has taken into
account any revised proposal made by Parent to the Company (a "Revised Parent
Proposal") within three business days after Parent's receipt of such notice and
again has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors that such Acquisition
Proposal (as the same may have been modified or amended) remains a Superior
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) if a Revised Parent Proposal has been made, and
such Acquisition Proposal had been modified or amended prior to the Board's
re-determination referred to in clause (B) above, the Board has: (x) first,
notified Parent of the revised terms of such Acquisition Proposal; (y) second,
established a deadline, and notified Parent and the person making such
Acquisition Proposal thereof, to occur not less than three nor more than seven
business days after giving such notice, for the submission of final proposals
from both Parent and such person; and (z) within seven business days after such
deadline, has again reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors that such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Acquisition Proposal and has notified
Parent of such determination.

     (d) The term "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer or proposal
(whether or not in writing and whether or not delivered to the Company's
stockholders generally), from any person to acquire, in a single transaction or
series of transactions, by merger, tender offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, consolidation, liquidation, business combination or otherwise (i)
at least 15% of any class of equity securities of the Company or one or more of
its Subsidiaries which in the aggregate constitutes 15% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (ii) assets of the Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries
which in the aggregate constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The term "Superior Acquisition
Proposal" shall mean any bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (x)
on terms more favorable to the holders of Shares than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent
to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (y)
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account the identity of the
person or persons making the proposal and all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal.

     (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board,
in circumstances not involving an Acquisition Proposal, from amending, modifying
or withdrawing the Company Board Recommendation to the extent that the Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
such action is necessary under applicable law in order for the directors to
comply with their fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders. The Company
shall give Parent and Merger Sub written notice of any such action taken by the
Board not later than the business day next succeeding the day on which such
action is taken, setting forth in reasonable detail the action taken and the
basis therefor.

     Section 5.08. PREPARATION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT.

     (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare a preliminary proxy statement relating to
the meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held in connection with the
Merger (together with any amendments thereof or

                                     - 36 -

<PAGE>

supplements thereto, in each case in the form or forms mailed to the Company's
stockholders, the "Proxy Statement") and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC.
The Proxy Statement shall include a recommendation of the Board (the "Company
Board Recommendation") that its stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and
this Agreement (subject to Section 5.07 hereof). The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within five (5)
business days after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC.

     (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event shall occur
that should be set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or
supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, and the Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or of additional requests by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information, and shall provide
to Parent promptly copies of all correspondence between the Company or any
representative of the Company and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review the
Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for additional information by, and
replies to comments of, the SEC before their being filed with, or sent to, the
SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts after consultation with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to
all such comments of and requests by the SEC.

     Section 5.09. STOCKHOLDER'S MEETING. The Company shall, through its Board,
take all action necessary, in accordance with and subject to the DGCL and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, to duly call, give notice of and
convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders not earlier than thirty
(30) calendar days, but in no event later than fifty (50) calendar days, after
the Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders, to consider and vote upon
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger (such special
stockholder meeting, the "Special Meeting"), PROVIDED that such later date may
be extended to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the Company to file and
distribute any material amendment to the Proxy Statement as is required by
applicable law. The Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Board Recommendation and the Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the approval of the Merger and this Agreement, subject to the duties of
the Board to make any further disclosure to the stockholders (which shall not,
unless expressly stated, constitute a withdrawal or adverse modification of such
recommendation) and subject to the right to withdraw, modify or change such
recommendation in accordance with Section 5.07 hereof. If the Board withdraws,
modifies or changes its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a
manner adverse to Parent or resolves to do any of the foregoing, the Company
shall nevertheless remain obligated to call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Special Meeting.

     Section 5.10. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Parent and the Company shall
use their reasonable best efforts to promptly notify each other of: (a) any
notice or other communication from any person alleging that the Consent of such
person is or may be required in connection

                                     - 37 -

material to the transactions; (b) any material notice or other communication
from any governmental or regulatory agency or authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or regarding any violation, or
alleged violation of law; (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
commenced or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened against or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (d) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event which would be reasonably
likely to cause any condition set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such notification, nor the obligation to make such
notification, shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants of any
party or the conditions to the obligations of any party hereunder.

     Section 5.11. STATE TAKEOVER LAWS.

     (a) If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"interested stockholder" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
(each a "Takeover Statute") (including the Interested Stockholder Statute) is or
may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statutes.

     (b) Without limiting the terms of Section 5.07, the Company covenants
and agrees that it will not take any action that would make the Interested
Stockholder Statute, any other Takeover Statute or Article TENTH of the
Company's certificate of incorporation inapplicable to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than the Merger).

directly or indirectly, (i) enters into a definitive agreement for an
Acquisition Proposal with any person who has made an Acquisition Proposal or any
affiliate of such person between the date of this Agreement and the date of such
termination or (ii) consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal with any person (provided that, for purposes of this Section
7.03(b)(z), all references to 15% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be 50%), then the Company shall promptly (and, in any event,
within three business days after the later of such termination by Parent, the
execution of a definitive agreement for an Acquisition Proposal or the
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, or in the case of such
termination by the Company, immediately upon such termination) pay to Parent a
termination fee of $12 million (the "Parent Termination Fee"). The Parent
Termination Fee shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

     (c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section

promptly (and, in any event, within three business days after such termination)
pay to the Company the sum of $30 million (the "Termination and Expense

Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or after any approval of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such approval, no amendment

stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of all the parties.

     Section 7.05. EXTENSION; WAIVER. Subject to the express limitations herein,

contained herein by any other party or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto by any other party or (iii) waive compliance with any
of the agreements of any other party or with any conditions to its own

                                       OF
                            COLE NATIONAL CORPORATION

      Cole National Corporation,  a corporation organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, hereby certifies as follows:

      1. The original  Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary
of State on May 31, 1984 under the name "CNC  Holding  Corporation",  a Restated
Certificate  of  Incorporation  was filed on October 13, 1992, a Certificate  of
Correction  was filed on February 25, 1994, a Certificate of Amendment was filed
on March 2, 1994, a Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed on April 18,
1994 and a Certificate of Amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
was filed on June 12, 1997.

      2. This  Amended and  Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  amends and
restates the corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to read in its
entirety as follows:

      FIRST. The name of the corporation is Cole National Corporation

      SECOND. The address of the corporation's registered office in the State of
Delaware is The  Corporation  Trust Center,  1209 Orange Street,  in the City of
Wilmington,  County of New Castle,  19801.  The name of its registered  agent at
such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

      THIRD.  The purpose of the  corporation  is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which  corporations may be organized under the General  Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "GCL").

      FOURTH.  The total number of shares of stock which the  corporation  shall
have  authority to issue is 3,000.  All such shares are to be Common Stock,  par
value of $.001 per share, and are to be of one class.

      FIFTH.  Subject  to the rights of the  holders of any series of  Preferred
Stock:

            (a) any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders
      of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special
      meeting of stockholders of the corporation and may not be effected by any
      consent in writing of such stockholders; and

            (b) special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be
      called only by (i) the Chairman of the Board, (ii) the President of the
      corporation, (iii) the Secretary of the corporation, (iv) the Secretary of
      the corporation within 10 calendar days after receipt of the written
      request of a majority of the total number of Directors that the

                                      A-1

<PAGE>

      "Whole Board"), and (v) the Secretary of the corporation within 10
      calendar days after receipt of written requests of a majority of the
      Voting Stock. For purposes of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
      Incorporation, "Voting Stock" means stock of the Corporation of any class
      or series entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors.

            Meetings of stockholders  may be held within or without the State of
Delaware,  as the by-laws may provide.  The books of the corporation may be kept

Directors or in the by-laws of the corporation.

            At any  annual  meeting or special  meeting of  stockholders  of the
corporation,  only such  business  will be conducted or  considered  as has been
brought  before  such  meeting  in the  manner  provided  in the  by-laws of the
corporation.  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation  to the contrary,  the affirmative vote of at least
80% of the Voting Stock,  voting together as a single class, will be required to
amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article FIFTH.

      SIXTH. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the
laws of the State of  Delaware,  the Board of Directors  of the  corporation  is
expressly  authorized to make,  alter and repeal the by-laws of the corporation,
subject to the power of the  stockholders  of the corporation to alter or repeal
any by-law whether adopted by them or otherwise.

      SEVENTH.  Each  person who is or was or had agreed to become a director or
officer of the corporation, or each such person who is or was serving or who had
agreed to serve at the  request of the Board of  Directors  or an officer of the
corporation  as an  employee  or  agent  of the  corporation  or as a  director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture,
trust or other enterprise  (including the heirs,  executors,  administrators  or
estate of such person),  shall be  indemnified  by the  corporation  to the full
extent  permitted  by the  GCL or any  other  applicable  laws as  presently  or
hereafter  in  effect.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of the effect of the
foregoing, the corporation may enter into one or more agreements with any person
which  provide for  indemnification  greater or different  than that provided in
this  Article.  Any repeal or  modification  of this Article  SEVENTH  shall not
adversely affect any right or protection existing hereunder immediately prior to
such repeal or modification.

      EIGHTH:  To the full extent  permitted by the GCL or any other  applicable
laws presently or hereafter in effect,  no director of the corporation  shall be
personally  liable to the corporation or its stockholders for or with respect to
any acts or omissions in the  performance  of his or her duties as a director of
the  corporation.  Any repeal or  modification  of this Article EIGHTH shall not
adversely  affect  any right or  protection  of a  director  of the  corporation
existing immediately prior to such repeal or modification.

      NINTH:  Section 1. BUSINESS  COMBINATIONS  WITH  INTERESTED  STOCKHOLDERS.
Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Amended and Restated  Certificate of
Incorporation  to the contrary,  the corporation will not engage in any Business
Combination  with  any  Interested  Stockholder  for a  period  of  three  years
following  the date that such  stockholder  became  an  Interested  Stockholder,
unless (a) prior to such date the Board of Directors  approved  the  transaction
that resulted in the stockholder  becoming an Interested  Stockholder,  (b) upon
consummation  of the transaction  that resulted in the  stockholder  becoming an
Interested  Stockholder,  the Interested  Stockholder  owned at least 85% of the
Voting Stock  outstanding at the time the transaction  commenced,  excluding for
purposes of determining the number of shares  outstanding  those shares owned by
(i) Persons who are  Directors  and also  officers of the  corporation  and (ii)
employee  stock plans  maintained by the  corporation  or any direct or indirect
majority-owned  subsidiary of the Corporation in which employee  participants do
not have the right to determine  confidentially  whether  shares held subject to
the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer, or (c) on or subsequent
to such date the Business  Combination is approved by the Board of Directors and
authorized at an annual or special meeting of  stockholders,  and not by written
consent,  by the affirmative  vote of at least 66-2/3% of the Voting Stock which
is not Owned by the Interested Stockholder.

      Section 2.  EXCEPTIONS.  The  restrictions  contained in Section 1 of this
Article NINTH will not apply if:

            (a) a stockholder  becomes an Interested  Stockholder  inadvertently
      and (i) as soon as  practicable  divests  sufficient  shares  so that such
      stockholder ceases to be an Interested  Stockholder and (ii) would not, at
      any time  within the  three-year  period  immediately  prior to a Business
      Combination  between the  corporation and such  stockholder,  have been an

      or more of a corporation's outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in

      the contrary.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, a presumption of Control will
      not apply where such Person holds voting stock,  in good faith and not for
      the  purpose of  circumventing  this  Article  NINTH,  as an agent,  bank,

      be determined  whether such Person is an Interested  Stockholder,  and the
      Affiliates and Associates of such Person; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the term
      Interested  Stockholder  will not include any Person  whose  Ownership  of
      shares in excess of the 15%  limitation  set forth herein is the result of
      action  taken  solely by the  corporation  unless  and until  such  Person
      thereafter  acquires additional shares of Voting Stock, except as a result

      Person.  For the purpose of determining  whether a Person is an Interested

                  time) pursuant to any agreement, or understanding, or upon the
                  exercise of  conversion  rights,  exchange  rights,  warrants,
                  options,  or other rights;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that a Person
                  will not be deemed the Owner of stock  tendered  pursuant to a
                  tender or  exchange  offer made by such  Person or any of such
                  Person's Affiliates or Associates until such tendered stock is

                  deemed to be the Owner of any stock  because of such  Person's

                  revocable proxy given in response to a proxy solicitation made
                  to 10 or more persons; or

                  (iii) has any agreement, arrangement, or understanding for the
                  purpose of acquiring,  holding, voting (except voting pursuant
                  to a revocable  proxy as described in subclause  (B) of clause
                  (ii) of this  paragraph  (f)), or disposing of such stock with
                  any other Person that

                    beneficially   own,   directly  or  indirectly  such  stock;
                    PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that a Person  may not be deemed to Own

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS
                            ------------------------


         Section 1.1. ANNUAL MEETINGS.  If required by applicable law, an annual
meeting of  stockholders  shall be held for the  election of  directors  at such
date, time and place, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware, as
may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time. Any
other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.

         Section 1.2. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or  purposes  may be called at any time by the Board of  Directors,  but
such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. Business
transacted  at any  special  meeting  of  stockholders  shall be  limited to the
purposes stated in the notice.

         Section 1.3. NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted  to take any action at a  meeting,  a notice of the  meeting  shall be
given that shall state the place,  if any,  date and hour of the meeting and, in
the case of a special meeting,  the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called.  Unless  otherwise  provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or
these  by-laws,  the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10)
nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed,  such notice shall be deemed to be
given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder  at such  stockholder's  address as it appears on the records of the
corporation.

         Section  1.4.  ADJOURNMENTS.  Any  meeting of  stockholders,  annual or
special,  may adjourn  from time to time to  reconvene at the same or some other
place,  and notice need not be given of any such  adjourned  meeting if the time
and place  thereof  are  announced  at the meeting at which the  adjournment  is
taken. At the adjourned  meeting the corporation may transact any business which
might have been  transacted at the original  meeting.  If the adjournment is for
more than thirty  (30) days,  or if after the  adjournment  a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting,  notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given
to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

<PAGE>

         Section  1.5.  QUORUM.   Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  law,  the
certificate of incorporation  or these by-laws,  at each meeting of stockholders
the  presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power
of the  outstanding  shares of stock  entitled to vote at the  meeting  shall be
necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the
stockholders so present may, by a majority in voting power thereof,  adjourn the
meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 1.4 of these by-laws
until  a  quorum  shall  attend.  Shares  of  its  own  stock  belonging  to the
corporation or to another  corporation,  if a majority of the shares entitled to
vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or
indirectly, by the corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted
for quorum purposes;  provided,  however, that the foregoing shall not limit the
right of the  corporation  or any  subsidiary of the  corporation to vote stock,
including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

         Section 1.6.  ORGANIZATION.  Meetings of stockholders shall be presided
over by the  Chairperson  of the Board,  if any, or in his or her absence by the
Vice  Chairperson  of the  Board,  if  any,  or in his  or  her  absence  by the
President,  or in his or her absence by a Vice  President,  or in the absence of
the foregoing persons by a chairperson designated by the Board of Directors,  or
in the absence of such designation by a chairperson  chosen at the meeting.  The
Secretary  shall act as secretary of the meeting,  but in his or her absence the
chairperson  of the meeting may  appoint any person to act as  secretary  of the
meeting.

         Section  1.7.  VOTING;  PROXIES.  Except as  otherwise  provided  by or
pursuant to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder
entitled  to vote at any meeting of  stockholders  shall be entitled to one vote
for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the
matter  in  question.  Each  stockholder  entitled  to  vote  at  a  meeting  of
stockholders  or to express  consent to  corporate  action in writing  without a
meeting may authorize  another person or persons to act for such  stockholder by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its
date,  unless  the  proxy  provides  for a  longer  period.  A  proxy  shall  be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable  and if, and only as long as, it
is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A
stockholder  may revoke any proxy  which is not  irrevocable  by  attending  the
meeting  and  voting  in  person  or by  delivering  to  the  Secretary  of  the
corporation  a  revocation  of the  proxy or a new proxy  bearing a later  date.
Voting  at  meetings  of  stockholders  need not be by  written  ballot.  At all
meetings of  stockholders  for the  election of  directors  at which a quorum is
present a plurality of the votes cast shall be  sufficient  to elect.  All other
elections and questions  presented to the  stockholders  at a meeting at which a
quorum is  present  shall,  unless  otherwise  provided  by the  certificate  of
incorporation,  these  by-laws,  the rules or  regulations of any stock exchange
applicable to the  corporation,  or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation
applicable to the corporation or its  securities,  be decided by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority in voting  power of the shares of stock of the
corporation  which  are  present  in person  or by proxy  and  entitled  to vote
thereon.

corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of
any dividend or other  distribution  or allotment of any rights,  or entitled to

for the purpose of any other lawful  action,  the Board of  Directors  may fix a

stockholders  entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without
a  meeting,  shall not be more  than ten (10) days from the date upon  which the

setting  forth the action  taken or  proposed  to be taken is  delivered  to the

         Section  1.10.  ACTION  BY  WRITTEN  CONSENT  OF  STOCKHOLDERS.  Unless
otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the  stockholders  may
be taken  without a  meeting,  without  prior  notice and  without a vote,  if a
consent or  consents  in writing,  setting  forth the action so taken,  shall be
signed by the  holders of  outstanding  stock  having not less than the  minimum
number of votes that would be  necessary  to  authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares  entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and
shall be delivered to the  corporation by delivery to its  registered  office in
the State of Delaware,  its principal place of business,  or an officer or agent
of the corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of proceedings of
stockholders are recorded.  Delivery made to the corporation's registered office
shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail,  return receipt  requested.
Prompt  notice of the taking of the corporate  action  without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required by law, be given to
those  stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had
been taken at a meeting,  would have been  entitled  to notice of the meeting if
the record date for such meeting had been the date that written  consents signed
by a  sufficient  number of  holders to take the action  were  delivered  to the
corporation.

         Section 1.11. INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. The corporation may, and shall if
required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders,  appoint one or more
inspectors of election,  who may be employees of the corporation,  to act at the
meeting or any  adjournment  thereof and to make a written report  thereof.  The
corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace
any  inspector  who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or
designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders,  the person presiding at
the meeting  shall appoint one or more  inspectors  to act at the meeting.  Each
inspector,  before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties,  shall take
and sign an oath to execute  faithfully  the  duties of  inspector  with  strict
impartiality  and according to the best of his or her ability.  The inspector or
inspectors so appointed or  designated  shall (i) ascertain the number of shares
of capital  stock of the  corporation  outstanding  and the voting power of each
such  share,  (ii)  determine  the  shares of capital  stock of the  corporation
represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots,  (iii) count
all votes and  ballots,  (iv)  determine  and retain for a  reasonable  period a
record of the  disposition of any challenges  made to any  determination  by the
inspectors,  and (v)  certify  their  determination  of the  number of shares of
capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors'
count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such
other  information  as may be required by law. In  determining  the validity and
counting  of proxies  and ballots  cast at any  meeting of  stockholders  of the
corporation,  the  inspectors  may consider such  information as is permitted by
applicable  law. No person who is a candidate  for an office at an election  may
serve as an inspector at such election.

         Section 1.12. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS. The date and time of the opening and
the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the  stockholders  will vote
at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person  presiding over the
meeting.  The  Board  of  Directors  may  adopt by  resolution  such  rules  and
regulations  for the  conduct of the  meeting of  stockholders  as it shall deem
appropriate.  Except to the extent  inconsistent

                                      B-4

presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to
convene and to adjourn the meeting,  to prescribe  such rules,  regulations  and

are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.  Such rules,  regulations
or  procedures,  whether  adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following:

those  present;  (iii)  limitations  on  attendance at or  participation  in the
meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation,  their duly authorized and
constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting
shall determine;  (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed
for the  commencement  thereof;  and (v)  limitations  on the time  allotted  to
questions or comments by  participants.  The presiding  person at any meeting of
stockholders,  in  addition  to  making  any  other  determinations  that may be
appropriate  to the  conduct  of the  meeting,  shall,  if  the  facts  warrant,
determine  and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly
brought  before the meeting and if such  presiding  person  should so determine,
such  presiding  person  shall so declare to the  meeting and any such matter or
business not properly  brought  before the meeting  shall not be  transacted  or
considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the
person  presiding  over the  meeting,  meetings  of  stockholders  shall  not be
required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

equitable,  loss of profits,  punitive,  tort, or any other damages,  costs,  or
attorney's fees. The Guarantor and Cole agree that this Guarantee  constitutes a
guarantee  of payment and not of  collection.  The  Guarantor  agrees to pay, on
demand,  and to save Cole harmless against  liability for, any and all costs and
expenses  (including fees and  disbursements of counsel) incurred or expended by
or on behalf of Cole in connection  with the  enforcement of or  preservation of
any rights under this Guarantee.

            3. GUARANTEE  ABSOLUTE AND  UNCONDITIONAL.  (a) The Guarantor hereby
agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional,  irrevocable,  and
absolute,  irrespective  of (i) the  validity  or  enforceability  of the Merger
Agreement,  (ii)  any  amendment  to or  modification  of any of  the  terms  or
provisions of the Merger  Agreement,  (iii) the absence of any action to enforce
the Merger Agreement  against the Payor, (iv) any waiver or consent by Cole with
respect to any provisions of the Merger Agreement, or (v) any other act or thing
or  omission,  or delay to do any other act or thing,  which may or might in any
manner or to any extent  either vary the risk of the  Guarantor as an obligor in
respect of the obligations  provided for in this Guarantee or otherwise  operate
as a discharge  of the  Guarantor  as a matter of law or equity  (other than the
indefeasible  payment  in  full in cash  of all of its  obligations  under  this
Guarantee). The Guarantor hereby waives demand of and protest of the Termination
and Expense  Reimbursement Fee and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment,
any right to require a  proceeding  first  against  the Payor,  and all  demands
whatsoever and covenants  that this  Guarantee will not be discharged  except by
complete  performance  of the  obligation  to pay the  Termination  and  Expense
Reimbursement Fee in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

            4. TERMINATION. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect
until the  earliest  to occur of:  (i) the  indefeasible  payment in full of the
entire Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee, (ii) termination of the Merger
Agreement in  accordance  with its terms  without any  obligation on the part of
Payor  to  pay  the  Termination  and  Expense   Reimbursement   Fee,  or  (iii)
consummation of the Merger. Thereafter,  Cole shall take such action and execute
such documents as the Guarantor may request in order to evidence the termination
of this Guarantee.

            5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Guarantor represents and warrants
to, and agrees with, Cole that:

                  (a)  Guarantor  is duly  organized  and validly  existing as a
corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware;

                  (b) Guarantor has duly taken all necessary corporate action to
authorize,  and has all necessary  corporate  power and authority to execute and
deliver,  this Guarantee and to perform the obligations of Guarantor pursuant to
this Guarantee. This

                                       C-2

<PAGE>

Guarantee  has been duly  executed and  delivered by Guarantor and is the valid,
binding and enforceable  obligation of Guarantor,  enforceable against Guarantor
in accordance with its terms,  except as such  enforcement may be limited by (i)
bankruptcy,  insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally or
(ii) general principles of equity,  whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law;

                  (c) The execution and delivery of this Guarantee by Guarantor,
and its performance of its obligations under this Guarantee, do not and will not
(i) violate or conflict with any provision of the charter documents or bylaws of
Guarantor,  (ii)  conflict  with  any  law,  rule or  regulation,  order,  writ,
injunction, decree, award, or any agreement, instrument,  indenture, deed or any
other restriction, to which Guarantor is subject or a party; and

                  (d) Each of LensCrafters Inc. and Avant-Garde  Optics LLC are,
and at all times during the term of this  Guarantee will be,  indirectly  wholly
owned subsidiaries of Guarantor.

            6.  SUBROGATION.  The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of
Cole against the Payor in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor  pursuant
to the provisions of this Guarantee;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that so long as any of
the  Termination and Expense  Reimbursement  Fee shall remain  unsatisfied,  all
rights of the Guarantor  against the Payor based upon such right of  subrogation
shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior
indefeasible payment in full of the Termination and Expense Reimbursement Fee to
Cole.

            7. REINSTATEMENT.  This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or
be reinstated,  as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof,
of any of the  Termination  and Expense  Reimbursement  Fee is rescinded or must
otherwise  be  restored or  returned  by Cole upon the  insolvency,  bankruptcy,
dissolution,  liquidation or  reorganization of the Payor or upon or as a result
of the  appointment of a receiver,  intervenor or conservator  of, or trustee or
similar  officer  for, the Payor or any  substantial  part of its  property,  or
otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

            8.  PAYMENTS.  The  Guarantor  hereby  agrees that if it is required
hereunder to pay the Termination and Expense  Reimbursement Fee, it will be paid
to Cole, by wire transfer of immediately  available  funds, to the wire transfer
address specified in a notice given by Cole to it.

            9.  NOTICES.  All  notices,  requests,  claims,  demands  and  other
communications  hereunder  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed to have been

            10.   SEVERABILITY.   Any  provision  of  this  Guarantee  which  is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof,  and any such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

            11. INTEGRATION.  This Guarantee  represents the entire agreement of
the  Guarantor  with  respect  to the  subject  matter  hereof  and there are no
promises or  representations,  written or oral,  by Cole relative to the subject
matter hereof not reflected herein.

            12. AMENDMENTS IN WRITING; NO WAIVER;  CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. (a) None
of  the  terms  or  provisions  of  this  Guarantee  may  be  waived,   amended,
supplemented or otherwise  modified except by a written  instrument  executed by
the  Guarantor and Cole;  PROVIDED  that any


                                       C-4
<PAGE>

provision  of this  Guarantee  may be waived  by Cole in a letter  or  agreement
executed by Cole and delivered to Guarantor pursuant hereto.

            (b)  Cole  shall  not by any act  (except  by a  written  instrument
pursuant  to  paragraph  12(a)  hereof),  be deemed to have agreed to any delay,
indulgence,  omission or  otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy
hereunder  or to have  acquiesced  in any default or in any breach of any of the
terms  and  conditions  hereof.  No  failure  to  exercise,  nor  any  delay  in
exercising,  on the part of Cole, any right, power or privilege  hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof.  No single or partial exercise of any right,  power
or privilege  hereunder shall preclude any other or further  exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other  right,  power or  privilege.  A waiver by Cole of any
right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to
any right or remedy which Cole would otherwise have on any future occasion.

            (c) The rights and remedies herein  provided are cumulative,  may be
exercised  singly or  concurrently  and are not exclusive of any other rights or
remedies provided by law.

            13. SECTION  HEADINGS.  The section  headings used in this Guarantee
are for  convenience  of reference  only and are not to affect the  construction
hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.

            14. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Guarantee shall be binding upon the
successors  and assigns of the  Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of Cole
and its  successors  and assigns;  provided that the Guarantor may not assign or
delegate any of its rights or  obligations  hereunder  without the express prior
written  consent  of Cole,  which  Cole may  grant or  withhold  in its sole and
absolute discretion.

            14. GOVERNING LAW. This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed
in  accordance  with the laws of the State of Delaware,  regardless  of the laws
that might  otherwise  govern under  applicable  principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.
