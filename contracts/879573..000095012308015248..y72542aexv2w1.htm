any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding, be
cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate, other than a
Certificate for Excluded Shares, shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such
shares of Company Common Stock have been converted. 

   

 (b) _Treasury Shares; Parent and Merger Sub Owned Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in treasury of the Company (the " _Company Owned Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

From and after 

   #####

exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the
Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)(i)_, if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such appraisal right, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holderÂ’s shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 (b) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company), a bank or trust company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares, (the " _Certificates_ ") and shares of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares, represented by book-entry (" _Company Book-Entry Shares_ "), upon surrender of such Certificates and Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_ from time to time after the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) _Deposit of Cash_.

Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than the third business day thereafter), the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates and letters of transmittal (and any related documentation) may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery). Each former stockholder of the Company, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, shall be entitled to receive a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to _Section 2.2(k)_) equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration into which such holderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificates or Company Book Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this _Article II_. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares under the provisions of this _Article II_. 

   

 (e) _Exchange Procedures for Company Stock Options_.

 (ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, shall take all actions reasonably requested by Parent to effectuate the 

   ##### 

  

    

provisions of this  _Section 2.2(e)_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries will be required to
deliver shares of Company Common Stock to any person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Stock Options. 

   

 (iii) Parent agrees to pay or cause to be paid by check all amounts owed by it under this _Section 2.2(e)_ as soon as is reasonably practicable following calculation of such amounts but no later than three (3) business days following the Closing. 

  

 (f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed payment in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at ParentÂ’s option, to Parent. Any holders of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (h) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, from and after the Effective Time, Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, except as otherwise provided by Law. 

   

 (i) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, and any holders of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(k)_). 

   

 (j) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such 

    ##### 

  

    

Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying
Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (k) _Tax Withholding_. Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, are required to withhold or deduct under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent and duly and timely paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (l) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the CompanyÂ’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely

affect the CompanyÂ’s or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company internal controls. The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
effective to ensure that all material information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the CompanyÂ’s periodic reports
under the Exchange Act is made known to the CompanyÂ’s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the CompanyÂ’s principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to such information required to be included
in the CompanyÂ’s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since June
1, 2007 and prior to the date of this Agreement, no material complaints from
any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters, and no material concerns from any employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters,
have been received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent,
prior to the date of this Agreement, a summary of all material complaints or
concerns relating to other matters made since June 1, 2007 and through the
execution of this Agreement through the CompanyÂ’s whistleblower hot-line or
equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the CompanyÂ’s chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the Board of
Directors or the Board of Directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant
to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any Company policy
contemplating such reporting, including in instances not required by those
rules.

Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code, as the case may be. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company maintains or contributes or, within
the past six (6) years has maintained or contributed, to any benefit
plan covered by Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability or

its Subsidiaries to severance pay, increase in severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, or as required by applicable Law, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of

been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any
Company Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year. 

   

 (c) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or a "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored, maintained or contributed to such a multiemployer or multiple employer plan in the past six (6) years.

No Company License is subject to any pending regulatory proceeding (other than those affecting the telecommunications industry generally or holders of similar licenses generally) before a Governmental Entity or judicial review, unless such pending regulatory proceedings or judicial review would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no event, condition or circumstance would preclude any Company License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent that such Company License is renewable by its terms), except where the failure to be renewed has not had or would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) The licensee of each Company License is in compliance with the terms of, and the FCC Rules that apply to, each Company License and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect thereto, including all reports, notifications and applications required by the Communications Act or the FCC Rules and the payment of all regulatory fees, contributions to the Universal Service Fund, the TRS Fund and all other such funds to which contributions are required by the FCC Rules, except where such failure to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such fees or contributions has not had, or would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 (e) All of the currently operating cell sites and microwave paths of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in respect of which a filing with the FCC was required, have been constructed and are currently operated in all respects as represented to the FCC in currently effective filings, and modifications to such cell sites and microwave paths have been preceded by the submission to the FCC of all required filings, in each case, except for any failure to so construct or operate or failure to make such filing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Appropriate notification to the Federal Aviation Administration has been made for each transmission tower owned or leased by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent such notification is required to be made by the Company or a Subsidiary by, and in accordance with, the FAA Rules, in each case, except as the failure to notify the FAA would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 (b) Each Other Company License is valid and in full force and effect and has not been suspended, revoked, cancelled or adversely modified, except where the failure to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation, cancellation or modification of such license or licenses has not had or would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, 

   ##### 

  

   

a Material Adverse Effect. No Other Company License is subject to (i) any
conditions or requirements that have not been imposed generally upon Permits

reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any pending regulatory proceeding (other than
those affecting the telecommunications industry generally or holders of
Permits in the same service generally) before a Governmental Entity or
judicial review, unless such pending regulatory proceeding or judicial review
would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 Except as (i) disclosed in any Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Parent since December 31, 2007 and prior to the date hereof with the SEC (excluding all disclosures in any " _Risk Factors_ " sections and any other prospective or forward-looking information) or (ii) disclosed in the corresponding section of the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that disclosure of any item in any section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or sections of this Agreement (whether or not an explicit cross reference appears) to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face, Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows: 

  

 Section 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Etc._ Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, if applicable, in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation and has the corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and, if applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company prior to the date hereof complete and correct copies as in effect as of the date hereof of the certificates of incorporation and by-laws of Parent and Merger Sub. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws, other than such violations as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.2 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the board of directors of Merger Sub and, except for the adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the Voting Agreement have been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the other parties hereto or thereto, each of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies).

 (c) Subject to the receipt of the Parent Regulatory Approvals, the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) constitute or result in any breach, violation of, or a termination or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, cause any additional payments under or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or to the loss of a material benefit under any Contract binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in the creation of any Liens upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws, in each case as amended, of Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default, right, loss or Lien that has not, and 

    ##### 

  

    

would not reasonably be likely to significantly impair or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 4.4 _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending (or, to ParentÂ’s knowledge, threatened) against or affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries and there are no Orders of or before any Governmental Entity, in each case, which would reasonably be likely to prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information provided by Parent with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement will, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 Section 4.6 _Ownership of the Company Common Stock_. Parent and its affiliates do not own, and have not for the past three years owned, at any time, shares of the Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into, or derivative of, shares of the Company Common Stock (exclusive of any shares owned by ParentÂ’s employee benefit plans) in an aggregate amount in excess of 4.9% of the outstanding Company Common Stock. 

  

 Section 4.7 _Finders or Brokers_.

 Section 4.8 _Availability of Funds_. ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s obtaining of funds to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 4.9 _No Disqualification_. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no facts in existence that relate to the qualifications of Parent and Merger Sub which would, under applicable Law, reasonably be likely to prevent Parent from obtaining any Parent Regulatory Approval or Company Regulatory Approval taking into account the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.10 _No Additional Representations_. Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this _Article IV_ , neither the Parent, Merger Sub nor any other person makes any representation or warranty with respect to the Parent or Merger Sub or their respective business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects.

 (xxiii) it shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree or enter into any contract, in contravention of the foregoing. 

  

 (c) Prior to making any written or material broad-based oral communications to the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication and shall promptly respond to the Company (such response to take no more than four (4) business days), and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication. 

   

 Section 5.2 _Investigation_. The Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, to the Company and its SubsidiariesÂ’ properties, Contracts, commitments, books and records, Representatives ( _provided_ that the CompanyÂ’s obligations with respect to Representatives shall be satisfied if the Company makes good faith requests of such Representatives) and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by the Company pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws, and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the CompanyÂ’s Representatives to furnish promptly to Parent or its Representatives such additional financial and operating data and other information as to the Company and its SubsidiariesÂ’ respective businesses and properties as Parent or its Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, except that nothing herein shall require either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to the other that would cause a violation of any agreement to which the disclosing party is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of legal privilege to the party disclosing such data or information, or would constitute a violation of applicable Laws; _provided_ that the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to provide such information and protect such 

    ##### 

 

  

privacy without violation of applicable Law. Parent hereby agrees that it will
treat any such information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of February 15, 2008 between the Company and Parent (as may be
amended) (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Parent and the Company agree
that, promptly following the date hereof, they shall enter into a mutual non-
disclosure agreement on commercially reasonable terms and conditions agreeable
to both parties, related to the disclosure and use of information for
purposes of integration of the CompanyÂ’s businesses into those of Parent. 

   

 Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that neither it, nor any Subsidiary of the Company, nor any of its or its Subsidiaries officers and directors, shall, and that it shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic information relating or with respect to, any Company Alternative Proposal, or in response to any inquiries or proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Alternative Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any Company Alternative Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Company Alternative Proposal, or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for, any Company Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements specifically permitted pursuant to _Section 5.3(c)_;  _provided_ that none of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company and its Representatives from contacting in writing any persons or group of persons who has made a written Company Alternative Proposal to solely request the clarification of the terms and conditions thereof; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that a copy of any such written clarification shall be provided to Parent no less than one (1) business day prior to sending to such person or group of persons. The Company shall immediately terminate, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to immediately terminate, all discussions or negotiations, if any, that are ongoing as of the date hereof with any third party with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal and shall immediately request the return of all related information. 

   

 (b) Promptly after receipt of any inquiries, proposals or offers related to, or if any information is requested with respect to, or any negotiations or discussions are sought in connection with a Company Alternative Proposal (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours), the Company shall notify Parent of such, and the identity of the person or group of persons involved, and shall provide copies of any written materials related thereto, and shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status, terms, discussions and negotiations with respect to such inquiry, proposal or offer or any amendment thereto. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company receives a Company Alternative Proposal which (x) constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (y) which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal by the person (or group of persons) making such Company Alternative Proposal and (ii) prior to taking the 

    ##### 

  

 

actions in (A) and (B) below, the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with such directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish (or cause to be
furnished by its Representatives) nonpublic information to the persons (or
group of persons) making such Company Alternative Proposal and its
Representatives and financing sources, if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the persons (or group
of persons) and its Representatives and financing sources an executed
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company and its Subsidiaries than the Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the persons (or
group of persons) and its Representatives with respect to the
Company Alternative Proposal. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing any "stop-look-and-listen" communication, if, in the good faith judgment of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, such disclosure is required under applicable Law; _provided_ that, (i) such disclosure shall be made at the latest time permissible under applicable Law and (ii) if such disclosure has the substantive effect of a Company Change of Recommendation (an " _Effective Change of Recommendation_ ") (it being understood that, so long as the Company continues affirmatively to recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder, it shall not be precluded from disclosing factually accurate information with respect to any Company Alternative Proposal or the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto), it shall be deemed a Company Change of Recommendation; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ in respect of any Effective Change of Recommendation. 

   

 (e) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer made by any person or group of persons prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (other than a proposal or offer by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their affiliates or associates) relating to any (i) acquisition of the Company by merger or business combination transaction, or for a "merger of equals" with the Company; (ii) acquisition by any person of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) acquisition by any person of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; (iv) acquisition by the Company following which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding the consummation of the transaction contemplated thereby cease to hold at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding equity of the Company immediately following such transaction or (v) any disposition of all or substantially all of the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ assets in Puerto Rico. 

   

 (f) As used in this Agreement " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Company Alternative Proposal made by any person or group of persons for assets representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated revenue of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (or, if such transaction involves any assets in Puerto Rico, 60% shall be substituted for 50%) or more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,  _provided_ that following such transaction, the stockholders of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company immediately preceding the consummation of such transaction hold no
less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding equity of the Company
immediately following such transaction, (and which proposal has not been
obtained by or on behalf of the Company in violation of this  _Section 5.3_,
and with respect to which the Company has fulfilled its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 5.3_) on terms that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial and
legal advisors, and after taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal (and the timing and likelihood
of consummation of such transaction), the person making the proposal and any
potential revisions to this Agreement suggested by Parent or its
Representatives, are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Company and its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.4 _Proxy Material_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as is reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, with the SEC the proxy statement (together with the letters to stockholders, notices of meeting and forms of proxies to be distributed to stockholders in connection with the Merger and any schedules required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith collectively, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") which shall (i) except to the extent provided in _Section 5.4(d)_, include the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the CompanyÂ’s stockholders adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder and (ii) comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders promptly following the date on which the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement; _provided_ that the Company shall provide written notice to Parent at least two (2) business days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement pursuant hereto. Each party shall promptly notify the other party upon the receipt by it or any of its Subsidiaries of any comments from the SEC or its staff, or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide the other party with copies of all correspondence between it or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement. 

   

 (b) The Company agrees that none of the information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement will, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, unless Parent has informed the Company in writing in a clear manner, within a reasonable time prior to its use, that such information should not be so included or incorporated by reference. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) If at any time prior to the Company Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by the Company or Parent, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information (or the party whose Subsidiary discovers such information) shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment, supplement or other filing incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable. 

   

 (d) (i) The Company shall, in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, duly call, give notice of, and, following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ ") and shall, through the Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The Company will use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.4_, the Board of Directors shall not withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may withdraw, amend or modify the Company Recommendation (a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with such directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that if such Company Change of Recommendation is as a result of a Company Alternative Proposal, the Board of Directors shall have concluded in good faith after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors that such Company Alternative Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Meeting, there shall have been a Company Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, pursuant to _Article VII_ , the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock for adoption at the Company Meeting. 

    

 (ii) No Company Change of Recommendation may be made until (A) at least three (3) business days have elapsed following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that management of the Company currently intends to recommend to the Board of Directors that it take such action and the basis therefor, including all information considered in making such decision and (B) the Company has (during such three (3) day period) given Parent the opportunity to propose to the Company revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company and its representatives shall have, if requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by 

   ##### 

  

    

this Agreement proposed by Parent. In determining whether to make a
Company Change of Recommendation in response to a Company Superior Proposal
or otherwise, the Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement suggested by Parent and any other information
provided by Parent in response to such notice. Any material amendment to any
Company Alternative Proposal will be deemed to be a new Company Alternative
Proposal for purposes of this  _Section 5.4_. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement, or, if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such Company Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) for a period not to exceed five (5) business days upon the occurrence of a state of facts, event, circumstance, change or effect, which the Company determines in good faith could reasonably be likely to result in a Company Change of Recommendation; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not affect ParentÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_. 

   

 Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide or cause to be provided to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries for so long as they remain so employed (the " _Company Employees_ ") a base salary and target bonus opportunity not less favorable than the base salary and target bonus opportunity in effect immediately before the Effective Time and welfare, compensation and employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements (excluding equity and equity-based awards, which will remain discretionary) that are reasonably comparable, in the aggregate, to those (excluding equity and equity-based awards) provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time; it being understood that nothing contained herein shall preclude Parent from changing or terminating any existing plan, program or arrangement pursuant to its terms so long as Parent complies with the provisions of this sentence. Parent may, in its sole discretion, make discretionary equity grants to Company Employees after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor the CompanyÂ’s existing bonus plan with respect to the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs for each Company Employee. The calculation of the bonus for such fiscal year for each Company Employee (the " _Closing Target Bonus_ ") shall, in respect of the portion thereof preceding the Closing Date, (i) assume that all subjective and individual performance criteria of the applicable Company Employee have been 100% satisfied and (ii) with respect to any objective Company performance criteria applicable to such Company Employee, compare the actual performance of the Company for the relevant fiscal periods against the Company budget targets for those applicable objective Company criteria levels for such periods. The portion of the Closing Target Bonus in respect of all periods from and after 

   ##### 

  

   

the Closing Date shall be based on the Company Employee and CompanyÂ’s actual
achievement of the performance criteria described in clauses (i) and (ii)
above as adjusted by Parent in good faith. Payment of the bonuses for both
the Pre-Closing Date and Post-Closing Date periods shall occur at the time at
which bonuses are normally paid under the terms of the relevant
Company/Parent Bonus Plan. Additionally, if the Closing Date occurs after the
end of the CompanyÂ’s current fiscal year and before payment of bonuses to
Company Employees in respect of such year, Parent shall cause the Company to
pay such bonuses in accordance with the terms of the Company bonus plan based
on actual achievement of the objective performance criteria and assuming that
all subjective and individual performance criteria of the applicable Company
Employee have been 100% satisfied. Pursuant to the Company severance plan
described in _Section 5.5(d)_ hereof, each Company Employee will be entitled
to receive a pro-rated bonus applicable to such Company Employee in the event
such Company Employee is terminated without Cause (as defined in _Section
5.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or, in the case of Company
Employees with the title of Director or above, resigns for Good Reason (as
defined in _Section 5.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) prior to the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (provided that (x)
the provisions of this sentence shall not result in the duplication of bonus
payments to such Company Employee, (y) for the avoidance of doubt, the
prorated portion of any Closing Target Bonus payment applicable to the Post-
Closing Date period shall reflect the ParentÂ’s good faith adjustment of
the performance criteria set forth above in this _Section 5.5(b)_ and (z)
the amount of any such prorated bonus shall not reduce the maximum amount of
severance payable pursuant to the Company severance plan as set forth on
Section 5.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule). 

   

 (c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and, for vacation and severance plan purposes only, level of benefits (but not benefit accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or for newly established plans and programs for which prior service of Parent Employees is not taken into account. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing to the extent permissible under the New Plans: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to Company employee benefit plan or compensation arrangement or agreements in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan, ending on the date such employeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins, to 

   ##### 

  

   

be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year,
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (d) Parent shall honor the Company severance program set forth on _Section 5.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (e) The Company may establish a retention pool (the " _Retention Pool_ ") prior to the Closing Date providing for the payment of retention bonuses to certain Company Employees in connection with the Merger for the purpose of retaining the services of such Company Employees, on the terms set forth on _Section 5.5(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid retention bonuses pursuant to the terms set forth on _Section 5.5(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (f) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended (provided that such amendments shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time) the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence participation therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee. 

   

 Section 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence of any event known to it which would reasonably be likely to, individually or in the aggregate, (i) in the case of the Company, have a Material Adverse Effect, or, in the case of Parent, using its reasonable best efforts, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) cause any condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be unsatisfied in any material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time or (b) any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or Parent, threatened which questions or challenges the validity of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor shall the party giving such notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters solely by virtue of having given such notice. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Filings; Other Action_. 

  

 (a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and any Persons of which it is a Subsidiary to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to 

   ##### 

  

   

be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
reasonably practicable notwithstanding any acquisition, divestiture or
similar transaction entered into by Parent after the date hereof (it
being understood that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Parent to obtain any consents, approvals, permits or authorizations prior to
the Termination Date), including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as
reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
notices, reports and other filings (including by filing no later than thirty
(30) days after the date hereof, all applications required to be filed with
the FCC and the notification and required form under the HSR Act ( _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure to file within such thirty (30) day period
will not constitute a breach of this Agreement so long as the filing is made
as promptly as practicable thereafter) and responding as soon as reasonably
practicable to any additional requests for information from the FCC, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Entity; (ii) subject to the foregoing, obtaining as promptly as reasonably
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, clearances
and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) providing to the
Company any material communication delivered to, and consult with the Company
in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity to the
extent solely relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or in
connection with any Action by a private party relating thereto, and giving
the Company the opportunity to attend and participate in all meetings and
conferences solely relating to the Merger (to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity and except in connection with any oral communication
initiated by a representative of a Governmental Entity); and (iv) defending,
contesting, resisting and resolving any Action challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger, including seeking to avoid the entry of, or
to have reversed, terminated or vacated, any stay or other injunctive
relief entered by any court or other Governmental Entity. 

   

 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, (i) Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect to any of their assets or operations, in each case that would take effect prior to the Effective Time or (ii) Parent or its Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect to (A) the operations or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that are not their mobile wireless voice and data businesses (as offered by ATandT Mobility LLC and its Subsidiaries and affiliates), (B) the operations or assets of ParentÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ mobile wireless voice and data businesses (as offered by ATandT Mobility LLC and its Subsidiaries and affiliates) that are not de minimis in the aggregate (it being understood that, for this purpose, in determining if restrictions or conditions are de minimis, whether something is de minimis shall be considered by reference to the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, rather than that of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (C) the Company or the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries unless such actions, restrictions and conditions would not, individually or in the aggregate, with respect to the matters described in this clause (C) together with any restrictions or conditions described in clause (B), reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries at or following the Effective Time (it being understood that, for this purpose, materiality shall be considered by reference to the financial condition, properties, assets, 

   ##### 

  

   

liabilities, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, rather than that of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ ").
For purposes of determining whether a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect
would reasonably be likely to occur, (A) both positive and negative effects of
any such actions, restrictions and conditions, including any sale,
divestiture, licensing, lease or disposition, shall be taken into account and
(B) any loss of synergies anticipated from the Merger as a result of such
actions, restrictions or conditions, including any sale,
divestiture, licensing, lease or disposition, shall not be taken into
account. The Company shall not be permitted to agree to any actions,
restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Parent, which, with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall not
be unreasonably (taking into account the other provisions of this _Section
5.7(b)_) withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult
the other on, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement).
To the extent permitted by Law, each party shall provide the other with
copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and
any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and
meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall include representatives of Parent and the Company. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. 

   

 (c) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other written communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Maintain Regulatory Status_. 

  

 (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cure no later than the Effective Time any material violations and defaults by any of them under any applicable FCC Rules and FAA Rules, (ii) substantially comply with the terms of any Company Licenses and the FAA Rules, (iii) file or cause to be filed with the FCC and the FAA all material reports and other filings required to be filed by the Company under applicable FCC Rules and FAA Rules and (iv) take all reasonable actions requested in writing by Parent on or before the Closing Date ( _provided_ that no such action shall be required if it would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect to any of their respective assets or operations, in each case that would take effect prior to the Effective Time) for each of them to be in compliance upon the consummation of the Closing with the 

   ##### 

  

   

provisions of Sections 271 and 272 of the Communications Act (including any
orders issued by the FCC interpreting or implementing such provisions). 

   

 (b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve the Company Licenses, Other Company Licenses and Company Permits and (ii) refrain from taking any action that would give the FCC or any other Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries reasonable grounds to institute proceedings for the suspension, revocation or adverse modification of any Company Licenses, Other Company Licenses and Company Permits, except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) where the failure to take such action, or the taking of such action, as the case may be, would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Takeover Statute_.

 Section 5.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and payment or reimbursement of fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim related to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time. For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) maintain in effect the current provisions regarding indemnification of officers and directors contained in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including advances for 

   ##### 

  

   

reasonable fees and expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines and, subject to
approval by Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened
or actual Action to which such Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be,
made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such individual is or was a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or
officer of another person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time. 

   

 (b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in either case, of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay, with respect to such insurance policies, in respect of any one policy year more than three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance under the current policy year ending January 2009 (as set forth on _Section 5.11(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 5.11(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. 

   

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this  _Section 5.11_, upon learning of any such Action, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such Action, (arising after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Parties (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, or between the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_  that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the 

   ##### 

  

   

Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without their prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives. Parent shall advance expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, to an Indemnified Party as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law upon receipt from the applicable Indemnified Party of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined such person is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives under this  _Section 5.11_ shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or applicable Law. 

   

 (f) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other persons, (ii) transfers fifty percent (50%) or more of its properties or assets to any person or (iii) enters into any similar transaction, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so the applicable successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Section 16(b)_. The Board of Directors may, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective operations. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Treatment of Certain Notes_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of Centennial Cellular Operating Corp., LLC and Centennial Puerto Rico Operations Corp. to use their respective reasonable best efforts to commence, as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so and the receipt of the completed Offer Documents from Parent, offers to purchase, and any related consent solicitations with respect to, any outstanding Indebtedness evidenced by indentures (the " _Note Indebtedness_ ") on the terms and conditions 

   ##### 

  

   

reasonably specified by Parent (collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ ") and
Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the closing of the Debt Offers shall be conditioned on, and
shall not occur prior to, the completion of the Merger and otherwise in
compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations and (ii) the
Company shall have no obligations to commence, any Debt Offer if such Debt
Offer would in any way delay the Closing. The Company shall provide, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offers. With respect to any
series of Note Indebtedness, if requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of
commencing a Debt Offer for such series (or in addition thereto), the Company
shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture governing such series of Note
Indebtedness (i) issue a notice of optional redemption for all of
the outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness of such series pursuant to
the requisite provisions of the indenture and governing such series of Note
Indebtedness or (ii) take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are
reasonably necessary for the satisfaction and/or discharge of such series
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the indenture and governing such
series of Note Indebtedness, and shall redeem or satisfy and/or discharge, as
applicable, such series in accordance with the terms of the indenture
governing such series of Note Indebtedness at the Effective Time. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to
the Debt Offers (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated and
that there shall be no Law or legal proceeding prohibiting consummation of
the Debt Offers) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not,
without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers
or make any changes to the terms of the Debt Offers other than as agreed
between Parent and the Company. 

   

 (b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following any consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee to) execute supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of Note Indebtedness for which the requisite consent has been received, which supplemental indentures shall implement the amendments described in the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related documents, as applicable (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offers). Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for any Note Indebtedness that has been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and in accordance with the Debt Offers using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. In no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to fund any Debt Offer or consent solicitation or redemptions or satisfaction and discharge prior to the Effective Time and all funds required for such Debt Offers and consent solicitations and redemptions and satisfaction and discharge shall be provided by Parent. Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred in any Debt Offer or consent solicitation prior to the Effective Time and shall reimburse the Company for such fees and expenses (provided that the Company shall not be required to incur aggregate expenses in excess of $100,000 under this _Section 5.14_ unless Parent advances to the Company funds sufficient to reimburse the Company for such expenses). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offers, including the Offer Documents (which shall include certificates and opinions of counsel), which shall be prepared as promptly as possible so as not to delay the closing of the Merger. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the holders of Note Indebtedness in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and its legal counsel. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent and the Company describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the applicable Indebtedness (which supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from preparing or filing any report required to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference into the Offer Documents. 

   

 (d) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent, together with the Company, may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents to provide assistance in connection therewith, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including indemnities, which indemnities shall be assumed by Parent in the event this Agreement is terminated) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers and/or consent solicitations upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and their Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the Debt Offers. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall be responsible for, and promptly, following receipt of documentation of such expenses, reimburse the Company for, all of CompanyÂ’s out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including any third party expenses) to the extent such costs and expenses are incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with it complying with its obligations under this _Section 5.14_ (including in connection with any Debt Offer or consent solicitation), and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines or other amounts suffered or incurred by them to the extent arising out of the good faith actions (or actions taken in compliance with its obligations under this _Section 5.14_ ) taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives pursuant to this  _Section 5.14_ (other than arising from information provided in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries), except in the event arising out of or resulting from the gross negligence of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section 5.14(d)_ shall survive the Effective Time and/or any termination of this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 5.15 _Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain the resignations of each director and officer of each Subsidiary of the Company effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 5.16 _Asset Dispositions_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist, including by entering into confidentiality agreements on reasonable terms, in the disposition of certain assets of the Company identified by Parent (the " _Asset Dispositions_ "), including using its reasonable best efforts to satisfy all conditions applicable to the Company in definitive agreements relating to such transaction and entering into such agreements at the request of Parent (provided that each such agreement expressly provide that the Company shall have no liability, cost, expense or other obligation under such agreement in the event of its termination); _provided_ that (a) Parent shall be responsible for, and promptly following receipt of documentation of such expenses, reimburse the Company for, all of CompanyÂ’s out-of pocket costs and expenses (including any third party expenses) to the extent such costs and expenses are incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with it complying with its obligations under this _Section 5.16_ (provided that the Company shall not be required to incur aggregate expenses in excess of $100,000 under this _Section 5.16_ unless Parent advances to the Company funds sufficient to reimburse the Company for such expenses), (b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines and other amounts suffered or incurred by them to the extent arising out of the good faith actions (or actions taken in compliance with its obligations under this _Section 5.16_) taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.16_, except in the event arising out of or resulting from the gross negligence of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives; (c) upon termination of this Agreement any such definitive agreements shall terminate without any liability, cost or expense to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder; (d) such dispositions shall be conditioned upon Closing and shall not impede or delay the Closing or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (e) the actions contemplated by this _Section 5.16_ shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section 5.16_ shall survive the Effective Time and/or any termination of this Agreement.

 (b) if (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ and no Company Meeting has been convened and held prior to the Termination Date (and the failure to convene and hold the Company Meeting is not the result of a material breach of this Agreement by Parent); (ii) a Company Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly made or announced and not withdrawn or abandoned prior to the Termination Date; and (iii) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement effecting a Qualifying Transaction with any person other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or a Qualifying Transaction shall have been consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent within two (2) business days after such entry or consummation by wire transfer of immediately-available funds the Termination Payment to an account previously specified by Parent, it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Payment to Parent on more than one occasion; and

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this Agreement shall be terminated and such termination gives rise to the obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Payment pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_, _(b)_ or _(c)_ , upon payment of the Termination Payment if and when due, ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s sole and exclusive remedy against the Company and any of its respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates 

   ##### 

  

 

(collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") for any breach, loss or damage
arising out of, or related to, this Agreement (including the termination
thereof) or any transactions ancillary thereto shall be the payment of such
Termination Payment, and no person shall have any rights or claims against
any of the Company Parties under this Agreement, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Company Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that, in the event that the termination of this Agreement does not give rise
to an immediate right of payment of the Termination Payment due to the terms
of _Section 7.2(b)_ and (i) the Termination Payment becomes payable pursuant
to the terms of such  _Section 7.2(b)_ and (ii) Parent shall have instituted
an Action and/or the parties shall have settled any Action or otherwise
resulting in payment of any damages or other amounts by the Company to
Parent, then the amount of the Termination Payment shall be reduced dollar for
dollar by the amount of any such payment by the Company described above in
this proviso (and thereafter the sole and exclusive remedy provisions of this
_Section 7.2(d)_ shall apply in all respects). The Company acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
this _Section 7.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
fee set forth in this _Section 7.2_ or any portion of such fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including
attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made from the date such payment was required
to be made through the date of payment.

one or more related transaction, any (i) acquisition of the Company by merger
or business combination transaction, or for a "merger of equals" with the
Company; (ii) acquisition by any person, or any person becomes the owner

affiliates or associates) of forty percent (40%) or more of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including by way of dividend,
recapitalization, spin-off or similar transaction; (iii) acquisition by any
person of forty percent (40%) or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or in shares convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for forty percent (40%) or more of the shares of Company Common
Stock or (iv) a transaction in which, immediately following completion of
such transaction, the stockholders who owned shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to completion of such transaction (without regard to
any of their holdings in the acquiring company) cease to hold at least sixty
percent (60%) of the shares of Company Common Stock.

 Section 8.11 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall not impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Subject to this _Section 8.11_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 8.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is 

   ##### 

  

 

invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction and a suitable and equitable provision
shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid
and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision. 

   

 Section 8.13 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Voting
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Amendment Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except for (a)
following the Effective Time, the right of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders (other
than holders of Excluded Shares) to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ and the holders of Company Stock Options to receive Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Stock Options pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_ (provided that the CompanyÂ’s stockholders shall not have the right to
enforce their right to receive Merger Consideration against Parent or any of
its affiliates while the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders are entitled pursuant to _Article II_ remains
deposited with the Paying Agent and the Paying Agent has not received any
instruction from Parent or any of its affiliates to withhold payment); (b)
the right of the Indemnified Parties to enforce the provisions of _Section
5.11_ hereof (Indemnification and Insurance); and (c) the right of the Company
on behalf of its stockholders to pursue damages in the event of ParentÂ’s or
Merger SubÂ’s willful breach of this Agreement (whether or not the Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ ), which rights are hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to, and nothing herein shall, confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The third-
party beneficiary rights referenced in clause (c) of the preceding sentence
of this _Section 8.13_ may be exercised only by the Company (on behalf of
its stockholders or as their agent) through actions expressly approved by the
Board of Directors, and no stockholder of the Company whether purporting to
act in its capacity as a stockholder or purporting to assert any right
(derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the Company, shall have any right or
ability to exercise or cause the exercise of any such right and if any Action
by any stockholder with respect to a breach of this Agreement is
not dismissed based on pleadings, the third party beneficiary rights
contained in clause (c) shall no longer apply. 

  

 Section 8.14 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. 

  

 Section 8.15 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall 

   ##### 

  

    

have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made
or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Each of the parties
has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must
be construed as if drafted by all the parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship
of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.16 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 

  

 Section 8.17 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.
