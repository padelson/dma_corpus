Common Stock, as applicable, and to each holder of record of a certificate (a
"RockTenn Certificate" and, together with a MWV Certificate, a "Certificate")
or book-entry share (a "RockTenn Book-Entry Share" and, together with a MWV
Book-Entry Share, a "Book-Entry Share,") that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of RockTenn Common Stock, as
applicable, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as TopCo may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by TopCo,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor that number of whole shares of TopCo Common Stock and/or cash, as
applicable, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If any portion of the applicable
Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person other than
the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration of such
Merger Consideration that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of such registration in the name of
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 3.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to TopCo Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to any shares of TopCo Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(e), in each case until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article III.
Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder of shares
of TopCo Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at
the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of TopCo Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of TopCo Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such shares of TopCo Common Stock.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-13-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in MWV Common Stock and RockTenn Common Stock.
All shares of TopCo Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
III (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2(b), Section 3.2(c) or
Section 3.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of MWV Common Stock or
RockTenn Common Stock, as applicable, theretofore represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of
TopCo to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by MWV or
RockTenn, as applicable, on such shares of MWV Common Stock or RockTenn Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the MWV Surviving Company of the shares of MWV
Common Stock, or the RockTenn Surviving Corporation of the shares of RockTenn
Common Stock, that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to TopCo or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III, except as otherwise provided by
law.

  

  

(e) Fractional Shares.

  

  

(i) No certificates representing fractional shares of TopCo Common Stock shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of TopCo.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of MWV Common Stock or RockTenn Common Stock converted pursuant to
either Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of TopCo Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fraction as determined
below. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of TopCo
Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by TopCo for issuance to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii) the aggregate number of full
shares of TopCo Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as the "Excess
Shares"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent,
as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall sell the
Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the manner
provided herein.

  

  

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until
the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or
sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all commissions, transfer taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any expenses, of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange
Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts
to such holders subject to and in accordance with this Section 3.2(e).

(f) Return of Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to TopCo, upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter be entitled to look only to
TopCo for payment of their claim for any shares of TopCo Common Stock, any
Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of TopCo Common
Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to TopCo Common Stock.

  

  

(g) No Liability. None of MWV, RockTenn, TopCo, MWV Merger Sub, the MWV
Surviving Company, RockTenn Merger Sub, the RockTenn Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of
the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash,
any shares of TopCo Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
TopCo Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to TopCo
Common Stock in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become
the property of TopCo, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(h) Investment of Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by TopCo, provided, that no
losses on such investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of
shares of MWV Common Stock or shares of RockTenn Common Stock pursuant to this
Article III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to TopCo.

  

  

(i) Withholding Rights. Each of TopCo and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-15-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by TopCo or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as TopCo or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of MWV Common Stock or shares RockTenn Common Stock, as applicable,
formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of TopCo
Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of TopCo Common
Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 3.3 Election Procedures. Each holder of record of shares of RockTenn
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Election Deadline
(a "Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article III, to submit an election on or prior to the Election Deadline
in accordance with the following procedures.

  

  

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 3.3 (an "Election") (i) the number of shares of
RockTenn Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Stock Election, (ii) the number of shares of RockTenn Common
Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a
Cash Election and (iii) the particular shares for which the Holder desires to
make either such election, and the order in which either such election is to
apply to any such shares if the election is subject to proration under Section
3.4. Any Holder who wishes to make an Election shall be required to waive all
dissenters' rights in connection with making such Election.

  

  

(b) TopCo shall, and RockTenn shall cause TopCo to, prepare a form reasonably
acceptable to MWV (the "Form of Election"), which shall be mailed by TopCo to
record holders of RockTenn Common Stock so as to permit those Holders to
exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.

  

  

(c) TopCo shall, and RockTenn shall cause TopCo to, mail or cause to be mailed
or delivered, as applicable, the Form of Election to record holders of
RockTenn Common Stock as of the record date for the RockTenn Shareholders
Meeting not less than 20 business days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. TopCo shall, and RockTenn shall cause TopCo to, make available one
or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by
all persons who become holders of record of RockTenn Common Stock during the
period following the record date for the RockTenn Shareholders Meeting and
prior to the Election Deadline.

  

  

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and accompanied by RockTenn Certificates to which such
Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of RockTenn or by an appropriate
customary guarantee of delivery of such RockTenn Certificates, as set forth in
such Form of Election, from a firm that is an eligible guarantor institution
(as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); provided, that such
RockTenn Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time
required in such guarantee of delivery, and, in the case of RockTenn Book-
Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth
in the Form of Election. Failure to deliver shares of RockTenn Common Stock
covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such
guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election,
unless otherwise determined by RockTenn, in its sole and absolute discretion.
As used herein, unless otherwise jointly agreed in advance by MWV and
RockTenn, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which
the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later of (i) the
date immediately prior to the RockTenn Shareholders Meeting and (ii) if on the
date immediately prior to the RockTenn Shareholders Meeting, both conditions
set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and 7.1(c) have not been satisfied, three
business days prior to the Closing Date. RockTenn and MWV shall issue a press
release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the anticipated
date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen business days before, and
at least five business days prior to, the anticipated date of the Election
Deadline. If the Closing is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be three
business days prior to the Closing Date) and RockTenn and MWV shall cooperate
to promptly publicly announce such rescheduled Election Deadline.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-16-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or
revoke such Holder's Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of
such Holder's RockTenn Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such
RockTenn Certificates, or any documents in respect of RockTenn Book-Entry
Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an Election is
validly made with respect to any shares of RockTenn Common Stock, any
subsequent transfer of such shares of RockTenn Common Stock shall
automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon
receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from RockTenn or MWV
that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII. The
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election
is not properly made with respect to any shares of RockTenn Common Stock (none
of MWV, RockTenn, TopCo, MWV Merger Sub, RockTenn Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent being under any duty to notify any shareholder of any such defect). In
the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such Election shall
be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of RockTenn Common Stock covered
by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing
Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made with respect to
such shares.

  

  

(f) MWV and RockTenn, in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, shall
have the joint right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the GBCC, governing the manner and extent to which
Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed
by Section 3.4.

  

  

SECTION 3.4 Proration

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

-17-  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Stock
Percentage of the shares of RockTenn Common Stock (other than any shares of
RockTenn Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and any
Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such number, the "Stock Cap Number") shall be converted into the right
to receive the RockTenn Stock Consideration, and all other shares of RockTenn
Common Stock (other than any shares of RockTenn Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and any Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive the RockTenn Cash Consideration. The "Stock Percentage" shall be equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the number of shares of TopCo Common
Stock that would be issued to holders of RockTenn Common Stock and in respect
of RockTenn Equity Awards as of the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement if such holders were to receive 49.9% of all of the
issued and outstanding shares of TopCo Common Stock (the "Threshold
Percentage") immediately following the Effective Time (after giving effect to
the issuance of shares of TopCo Common Stock to holders of MWV Common Stock as
of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
calculated based on the aggregate number of shares of MWV Common Stock issued
and outstanding as of the business day prior to the Closing Date) by (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of RockTenn Common Stock issued and outstanding as
of the business day prior to the Closing Date, plus the RockTenn Reserved
Common Stock as of such date, plus the number of shares of RockTenn Common
Stock that will be deemed issued solely as a result of the Mergers pursuant to
RockTenn Equity Awards outstanding as of such day, with such quotient
expressed as a percentage. There shall not be any adjustment to the Threshold
Percentage pursuant to Section 3.5. In the event that a party reasonably
determines that Stock Percentage calculated in accordance with the definition
thereof is not consistent with the spin-off referred to in Section 2.6 being
tax-free to TopCo and its affiliates, then the reference to "49.9%" in such
definition shall be automatically reduced (but in any event not to a
percentage lower than 49.5%) to the extent necessary to cause such spin-off to
be tax-free to TopCo and its affiliates pursuant to the reasonable
determination of such party.

  

  

(b) If the aggregate number of Stock Electing Shares (such number, the "Stock
Election Number") exceeds the Stock Cap Number, then (i) all Cash Electing
Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the RockTenn Cash Consideration and (ii) the number of Stock Electing Shares
of each holder of shares of RockTenn Common Stock that shall be converted into
the right to receive the RockTenn Stock Consideration shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Stock Electing Shares of
such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Cap Number
and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining
number of such holder's Stock Electing Shares being converted into the right
to receive the RockTenn Cash Consideration.

  

  

(c) If the Stock Election Number is less than or equal to the Stock Cap Number
(such difference between the Stock Election Number and Stock Cap Number, the
"Shortfall Number"), then (x) all Stock Electing Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the RockTenn Stock Consideration and (y) the Cash
Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be treated in the following
manner:

  

  

(i) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of
Non-Electing Shares, then (A) all Cash Electing Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the RockTenn Cash Consideration and (B) the Non-Electing
Shares of each holder of shares of RockTenn Common Stock shall be converted
into the right to receive the RockTenn Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Non-Electing Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I)
the number of Non-Electing Shares of such holder by (II) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the
aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, with the remaining number of such
holder's Non-Electing Shares being converted into the right to receive the
RockTenn Cash Consideration; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-18-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing
Shares, then (I) all Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the RockTenn Stock Consideration and (II) the number of Cash Electing
Shares of each holder of shares of RockTenn Common Stock that shall be
converted into the right to receive the RockTenn Stock Consideration shall be
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the number of Cash Electing
Shares of such holder by (II) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount
by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing
Shares and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Cash Electing
Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Electing Shares being
converted into the right to receive the RockTenn Cash Consideration.

  

  

SECTION 3.5 Certain Adjustments. If between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of MWV Common Stock or RockTenn Common Stock are
changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, dividend payable
in stock or other securities or other similar transaction, the MWV Exchange
Ratio and related provisions shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the
holders of MWV Common Stock and RockTenn Common Stock or MWV Equity Awards and
RockTenn Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange, dividend or other similar transaction.

  

  

SECTION 3.6 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors or managers, as applicable, of TopCo, RockTenn Surviving
Corporation and MWV Surviving Company shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of MWV or RockTenn, any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
thereof, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in TopCo, any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by
TopCo as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

  

SECTION 3.7 Certain Option Exercises. RockTenn shall suspend the exercise of
the RockTenn Options effective from and after the Specified Date.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

  

  

SECTION 4.1 Representations and Warranties of MWV. Except as set forth in any
MWV SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the "MWV Filed SEC Documents") and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1,
2014 (excluding any disclosures in any risk factors section, in any section
related to forward-looking statements and other disclosures that are
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or as disclosed in the disclosure
letter delivered by MWV to RockTenn prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the "MWV Disclosure Letter") and making reference to the particular
subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken (provided, that
such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and such
other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other subsections), MWV represents and warrants to RockTenn
as follows:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-19-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of MWV and its
subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize
such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries,
for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MWV. Each of MWV and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MWV. MWV has
delivered to or made available to RockTenn prior to the execution of this
Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to the Certificate of
Incorporation of MWV (the "MWV Certificate of Incorporation") and the By-laws
of MWV not filed as of the date hereof with the MWV Filed SEC Documents.

  

  

(b) Corporate Authority; Non-contravention.

  

  

(i) MWV has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to the MWV Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by MWV and the consummation by MWV of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
MWV, subject in the case of the MWV Merger to the MWV Stockholder Approval.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by MWV and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by RockTenn,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of MWV, enforceable
against MWV in accordance with its terms.

  

  

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
pledge, claim, lien, charge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind or
nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens") upon any of the properties or assets
of MWV or any of its subsidiaries, under (A) the MWV Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-laws of MWV or the comparable organizational documents
of any of its subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, trust document, lease or other agreement, instrument,
permit, concession, franchise, license or similar authorization to which MWV
or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which MWV, any of its subsidiaries
or their respective properties or assets may be bound or (C) subject to the
governmental filings and other matters referred to in clause (iii) below, any
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to MWV or any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, rights, losses, restrictions or Liens that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (1) have a Material
Adverse Effect on MWV or (2) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state, local,
foreign or supranational government, any court, administrative, regulatory or
other governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental
self-regulatory agency, commission or authority (a "Governmental Entity") is
required by or with respect to MWV or any of its subsidiaries in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by MWV or the consummation
by MWV of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (A) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "HSR Act"), and with any other applicable federal, state or foreign laws
that are designed to govern foreign investment or competition, or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization, lessening of competition or restraint of trade (together with
the HSR Act, the "Antitrust Laws"); (B) the filing with the SEC of (x) a proxy
statement relating to the MWV Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section
6.1(b)) (such proxy statement, together with the proxy statement relating to
the RockTenn Shareholders Meeting, in each case as amended or supplemented
from time to time, the "Joint Proxy Statement"), (y) the registration
statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by TopCo in connection with the
issuance of shares of TopCo Common Stock in the Mergers (the "Form S-4") and
(z) such reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as may be required in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (C) the filing
of the MWV Certificate of Merger and the RockTenn Certificate of Merger with
the appropriate Secretaries of State and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of other states in which MWV and RockTenn or their
respective subsidiaries are qualified to do business; (D) such filings with

of TopCo Common Stock that are to be issued in the Mergers to be listed on the
NYSE; and (E) such other consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the
failure of which to be made or obtained, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect on MWV

contemplated hereby.

upon the value of, capital stock or voting securities of MWV, and (B) there

or other equity interests in, each Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) have been validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by MWV, free and clear

(e) SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.

  

  

(i) MWV and its subsidiaries have filed or furnished all required registration
statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2012 (the "MWV
SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the MWV SEC Documents complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the MWV
SEC Documents, and none of the MWV SEC Documents when filed and at their
respective effective times, if applicable, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC
with respect to any of the MWV SEC Documents, and, to the knowledge of MWV,
none of the MWV SEC Documents is the subject of any outstanding SEC comment or
outstanding SEC investigation.

  

  

(ii) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of MWV and its subsidiaries included in the MWV SEC Documents (the
"MWV Financial Statements") were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of MWV and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not material and to
any other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto).

(iii) Except (A) as reflected or reserved against in MWV's consolidated
audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 (or the notes thereto) as
included in the MWV Filed SEC Documents, (B) for liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since December 31, 2013 and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
connection with or contemplated by this Agreement, neither MWV nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to
be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of MWV and its subsidiaries (or
in the notes thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MWV.

  

  

(iv) MWV maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of MWV's
properties or assets. Since January 1, 2012, none of MWV, MWV's independent
accountants, the Board of Directors of MWV or its audit committee has received
any oral or written notification of any (i) "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of MWV, (ii) "material weakness" in
the internal controls over financial reporting of MWV or (iii) fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees of MWV who have a
significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of MWV.

  

  

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by MWV are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by MWV in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information
required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the management of
MWV, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of MWV
to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to
such reports.

  

  

(vi) Neither MWV nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among MWV and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, MWV or any of its
subsidiaries in MWV's or such subsidiary's published financial statements or
other MWV SEC Documents.

(f) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by MWV specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it
is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to MWV's stockholders or at the time of the MWV
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement shall
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation or warranty is made by MWV with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by RockTenn specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

  

  

(g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities
that are required for the operation of the businesses of MWV and its
subsidiaries (the "MWV Permits"), except where the failure to have any such
MWV Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MWV. MWV and its subsidiaries
are in compliance with the terms of the MWV Permits and all applicable laws,
statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or
judgments, decisions or orders entered by any Governmental Entity
(collectively, "Applicable Laws") relating to MWV and its subsidiaries or
their respective businesses or properties, except where the failure to be in
compliance with such Applicable Laws, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MWV. No
action, demand, requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no
suit, action, investigation or proceeding by any person, in each case with
respect to MWV or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties, is pending or, to the knowledge of MWV, threatened, other than, in

information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2012 (the
"RockTenn SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the RockTenn SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to the RockTenn SEC Documents, and none of the RockTenn SEC Documents when
filed and at their respective effective times, if applicable, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments received from the SEC with respect to any of the RockTenn SEC
Documents, and, to the knowledge of RockTenn, none of the RockTenn SEC
Documents is the subject of any outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC
investigation.

respects in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of RockTenn and
its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments which are not material and to any other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto).

obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2014 and (C) for liabilities and obligations
incurred in connection with or contemplated by this Agreement, neither
RockTenn nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
RockTenn.

  

  

(iv) RockTenn maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)

as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of

audit committee has received any oral or written notification of any (i)
"significant deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting of
RockTenn, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial
reporting of RockTenn or (iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of RockTenn who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of RockTenn.

  

  

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by RockTenn are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by RockTenn in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of RockTenn, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of RockTenn to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  

  

(vi) Neither RockTenn nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among RockTenn and any
of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, RockTenn or any of
its subsidiaries in RockTenn's or such subsidiary's published financial
statements or other RockTenn SEC Documents.

it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to RockTenn's shareholders or at the time of the
RockTenn Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by
RockTenn with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by MWV specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

  

  

(g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and RockTenn and each subsidiary
of RockTenn have in all material respects performed all obligations required
to be performed by them to date under each RockTenn Material Contract, except
where such noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not

notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any RockTenn

SECTION 5.2 No Solicitation by MWV. (a) MWV shall not, shall not authorize or
permit any of its controlled affiliates or any of its or their officers,
directors or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative (a "Representative") retained by it or any of its controlled
affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information),
or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or
the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a MWV
Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate in any substantive discussions or
negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any person, with respect to any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which
would constitute a MWV Alternative Transaction; provided, however, that if, at
any time prior to obtaining the MWV Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of MWV determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that any
such proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section
5.2(a) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a MWV Superior Proposal,
subject to compliance with Section 5.2(c), MWV and its Representatives may (A)
furnish information with respect to MWV and its subsidiaries to the person
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources) (provided
that all such information has previously been provided to RockTenn or is
provided to RockTenn prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms as to confidentiality generally no less restrictive than the
terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated October 4, 2014, entered into
between MWV and RockTenn (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and (B) participate
in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal with the person making
such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources). For purposes of
this Agreement, "MWV Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction
or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons)
other than RockTenn and its subsidiaries (including TopCo, MWV Merger Sub and
RockTenn Merger Sub) (a "MWV Third Party"), acquires or would acquire,
directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the outstanding shares of MWV Common
Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of MWV, whether from MWV or pursuant to a tender
offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange or similar transaction involving MWV or any of its subsidiaries,
(iii) any transaction pursuant to which any MWV Third Party acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose
the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of MWV and any entity
surviving any merger or combination including any of them) of MWV or any of
its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net
income or assets of MWV and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iv) any
disposition of assets representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues,
net income or assets of MWV and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2(b), neither the Board of Directors
of MWV nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
RockTenn, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such
committee of the MWV Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any MWV Alternative Transaction (any
action in clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as a "MWV
Subsequent Determination") or (iii) cause MWV or any of its controlled
affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any MWV Alternative
Transaction or requiring, or reasonably likely to cause, MWV to terminate,
delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or
be inconsistent with, the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 5.2(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that prior to obtaining the MWV Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of MWV determines in good faith, after it has received a MWV
Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of MWV may (subject to this and the
following sentences) effect a MWV Subsequent Determination or cause MWV to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) and concurrently with such
termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for such MWV Superior
Proposal (subject to the satisfaction of its obligations under Section
8.2(b)), but only at a time that is after the fourth business day following
RockTenn's receipt of written notice from MWV advising RockTenn that the Board
of Directors of MWV has received a MWV Superior Proposal specifying the
material terms and conditions of such MWV Superior Proposal, identifying the
person making such MWV Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make a
MWV Subsequent Determination; provided that in the event of a subsequent
modification to the material terms and conditions of such MWV Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of MWV may only effect a MWV Subsequent
Determination after the second business day following RockTenn's receipt of
written notice from MWV advising RockTenn of the modification to such terms
and conditions. For purposes of this Agreement, a "MWV Superior Proposal"
means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified
terms, if amended or modified) made by a MWV Third Party to enter into a MWV
Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of MWV
Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes)
that (A) did not result from a material breach of Section 5.2(a), (B) is on
terms that the Board of Directors of MWV determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of view to MWV's
stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into
account all relevant factors (including any changes to this Agreement that may
be proposed by RockTenn in response to such proposal to enter into a MWV
Alternative Transaction and the identity of the person making such proposal to
enter into a MWV Alternative Transaction) and (C) is reasonably likely to be
completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the MWV
Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of MWV determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of MWV may effect a MWV Subsequent
Determination in response to any event, change, effect, development, state of
facts, condition or occurrence that materially affects (A) the business,
financial condition or results of operations of MWV and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (B) the stockholders of MWV (including the benefits of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to MWV or the stockholders of
MWV), in either case that (x) is first occurring after the date hereof, (y)
does not involve or relate to a proposal the consummation of which would
constitute a MWV Alternative Transaction and does not involve or relate to
RockTenn or its affiliates, and (z) is not known and was not reasonably
foreseeable to the Board of Directors of MWV as of the date hereof, but only
at a time that is after the fourth business day following RockTenn's receipt
of written notice from MWV advising RockTenn of all material information with
respect to any such events, changes, effects, developments, conditions or
occurrences and stating that it intends to make a MWV Subsequent Determination
and providing a full description of its rationale therefor.

(c) In addition to the obligations of MWV set forth in Sections 5.2(a) and
Section 5.2(b), MWV shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of
receipt thereof, advise RockTenn orally and in writing of any request for
information or of any proposal relating to a MWV Alternative Transaction, the
material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or
proposal. MWV shall (i) keep RockTenn reasonably informed of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
proposal on a current basis and (ii) provide to RockTenn as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written materials exchanged between MWV or its subsidiaries or any of
their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request or
proposal, on the other hand, that describes in any material respect any of the
material terms or conditions of any such request or proposal.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit MWV from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder;
provided, however, that any such disclosure or statement that constitutes or
contains a MWV Subsequent Determination shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 5.2(b) (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a
disclosure that constitutes only a "stop, look and listen" statement or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a MWV Subsequent Determination).

SECTION 5.3 No Solicitation by RockTenn. (a) RockTenn shall not, shall not
authorize or permit any of its controlled affiliates or any of its or their
officers, directors or employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause any Representatives retained by it or any of its controlled
affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information),
or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or
the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a
RockTenn Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate in any substantive
discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any person, with
respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a RockTenn Alternative Transaction;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to obtaining the RockTenn
Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of RockTenn determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal that that did not
result from a material breach of this Section 5.3(a) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a RockTenn Superior Proposal, subject to
compliance with Section 5.3(c), RockTenn and its Representatives may (A)
furnish information with respect to RockTenn and its subsidiaries to the
person making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources)
(provided that all such information has previously been provided to MWV or is
provided to MWV prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms as to confidentiality generally no less restrictive than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal with the person making such proposal (and
its Representatives and financing sources). For purposes of this Agreement,
"RockTenn Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than
RockTenn and its subsidiaries (a "RockTenn Third Party"), acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the outstanding shares of
RockTenn Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 20% or more of the voting power of RockTenn, whether from
RockTenn or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction involving
RockTenn or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any transaction pursuant to which
any RockTenn Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of subsidiaries of RockTenn and any entity surviving any merger or
combination including any of them) of RockTenn or any of its subsidiaries
representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
RockTenn and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iv) any disposition of
assets representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or
assets of RockTenn and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

  

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.3(b), neither the Board of Directors
of RockTenn nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify,
or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
MWV, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such
committee of the RockTenn Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any RockTenn Alternative
Transaction (any action in clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as
a "RockTenn Subsequent Determination") or (iii) cause RockTenn or any of its
controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any RockTenn
Alternative Transaction or requiring, or reasonably likely to cause, RockTenn
to terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede,
interfere with or be inconsistent with, the consummation of the Mergers or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.3(a)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that prior to obtaining the RockTenn Shareholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of RockTenn determines in good faith, after
it has received a RockTenn Superior Proposal (and after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of RockTenn
may (subject to this and the following sentences) effect a RockTenn Subsequent
Determination or cause RockTenn to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) and concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive
agreement providing for such RockTenn Superior Proposal (subject to the
satisfaction of its obligations under Section 8.2(c)), but only at a time that
is after the fourth business day following MWV's receipt of written notice
from RockTenn advising MWV that the Board of Directors of RockTenn has
received a RockTenn Superior Proposal specifying the material terms and
conditions of such RockTenn Superior

that in the event of a subsequent modification to the material terms and
conditions of such MWV Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of MWV may
only effect a MWV Subsequent Determination after the second business day
following RockTenn's receipt of written notice from MWV advising RockTenn of
the modification to such terms and conditions. For purposes of this Agreement,
a "RockTenn Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal (on its
most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a
RockTenn Third Party to enter into a RockTenn Alternative Transaction (with
all references to 20% in the definition of RockTenn Alternative Transaction

of Directors of RockTenn determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of RockTenn
may effect a RockTenn Subsequent Determination in response to any event,
change, effect, development, state of facts, condition or occurrence that
materially affects (A) the business, financial condition or results of

receipt thereof, advise MWV orally and in writing of any request for
information or of any proposal relating to a RockTenn Alternative Transaction,
the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

SECTION 6.1 Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, MWV and RockTenn shall prepare, and RockTenn shall cause TopCo to
file with the SEC, the Joint Proxy Statement, and RockTenn shall prepare and
cause TopCo to file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement shall be included as a prospectus. Each of MWV, RockTenn and TopCo
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. MWV,
RockTenn and TopCo shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide the other party copies of any written comments and advise the other
party of any oral comments, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement received
from the SEC. TopCo shall, and RockTenn shall cause TopCo to, provide MWV with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 shall be made without the
approval of both MWV and RockTenn, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided that with respect to documents filed by a party
that are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement,
this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating
to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of
operations, or the combined entity; and provided, further, that this approval
right shall not apply with respect to information relating to a MWV Subsequent
Determination or a RockTenn Subsequent Determination. MWV shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to MWV's
stockholders, and RockTenn shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to RockTenn's shareholders, in each case as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. TopCo shall, and RockTenn shall cause TopCo to, advise MWV
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to MWV, RockTenn, TopCo, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
MWV, RockTenn or TopCo that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of MWV and RockTenn.

with the DGCL for the purpose of obtaining the MWV Stockholder Approval and
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(b), through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement. MWV
may only postpone or adjourn the MWV Stockholder's Meeting (i) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the MWV Stockholder Approval,
(ii) for the absence of a quorum and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that
MWV has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably
likely to be required under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of MWV
prior to the MWV Stockholders Meeting.

  

  

(c) RockTenn shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a

accordance with the GBCC for the purpose of obtaining the RockTenn Shareholder
Approval and shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(b), through its
Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders the approval of this
Agreement. RockTenn may only postpone or adjourn the RockTenn Shareholders
Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the
RockTenn Shareholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum and (iii) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that RockTenn has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by shareholders of RockTenn prior to the RockTenn
Shareholders Meeting.

SECTION 6.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, each of MWV and RockTenn shall, and shall cause each of its respective
subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the officers, employees and
Representatives of such other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and records (provided that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of such party), and during such period, each of MWV
and RockTenn shall, and shall cause each of its respective subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other party all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. No review
pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall affect any representation or warranty given
by the other party hereto. Each of MWV and RockTenn shall hold, and shall
cause its respective affiliates, officers, employees and Representatives to
hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities, including any required action or non-action under the
Antitrust Laws (the "Required Consents") prior to the Effective Time, and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain a Required Consent from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers, and any necessary or appropriate financing
arrangements, from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and
(iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event
within ten business days of the date hereof, (ii) appropriate filings, if any
are required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable
and (iii) all other necessary filings with other Governmental Entities
relating to the Merger, and, in each case, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
formally or informally requested pursuant to the Antitrust Laws or by such
authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws and the
receipt of the Required Consents as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither MWV nor RockTenn shall be
required to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any of
its businesses or assets or enter into any consent decree or other agreement
that would restrict it in the conduct of its business as heretofore conducted

of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any
federal court located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than any Delaware state court or any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware.

SECTION 9.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under
this Section 9.11 with respect thereto. Upon a determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.
