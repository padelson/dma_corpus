Adverse Effect qualification contained in them, in each case as of the date of
this Arrangement Agreement and as of the Effective Date with the same effect
as though made as of the Effective Date (except that the accuracy of
representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a specified
date will be determined as of such date), except where the failure or failures
of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct in all
respects would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and Thompson shall have
received a certificate signed by the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Parent (on behalf of Parent and not in their personal
capacity) to such effect. 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(2)

Rights and Thompson Warrantholders, as applicable, and (ii) Thompson, in
accordance with the terms of Plan of Arrangement, cash in the amount equal to
the aggregate amount of PSU Consideration payable to holders of PSUs, in each
case pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement. Such cash shall be held by the
Depositary for the exclusive purpose of making the cash payments to the
holders of Thompson Shareholders, Thompson Optionholders, holders of Quinto
Rights and Thompson Warrantholders, as applicable, and shall be held by
Thompson for the exclusive purpose of making the cash payments to holders of

_Notice and Cure Provisions_ 

---|--- 

Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure
to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Arrangement Agreement and the Effective Time of any event
or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to:

 |

cause any of the representations or warranties of either Party contained
herein qualified as to materiality to be untrue or inaccurate or any of those
not so qualified to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the
date hereof or at the Effective Date; or

pursuant to the conditions set forth herein or any termination right arising
therefrom under Section 8.02(1)(b) or Section 8.02(1)(c) and no payments are
payable as a result of such election pursuant to Section 7.04 unless, prior
to the Effective Date, the Party intending to rely thereon has delivered -  77  - 



 

 a written notice to the other Party specifying in reasonable detail all
breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which
the Party delivering such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-
fulfilment of the applicable condition or termination right, as the case may
be. If any such notice is delivered, provided that a Party is proceeding
diligently to cure such matter and such matter is capable of being cured, no
Party may terminate this Arrangement Agreement until the earlier of (i) the
Outside Date, and (ii) the date that is 30 days following receipt of such
notice by the Party to whom the notice was delivered, if such matter has not
been cured by such date.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



   

7.01

 |

_Non-Solicitation_ 

---|--- 



     |

(1)

 |

Thompson shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director,
employee, representative (including any financial or other advisor) or agent
of Thompson or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) make, solicit, initiate, assist,
encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing information
or entering into any form of agreement) the initiation of any inquiries
or proposals regarding, constituting or that may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any information with respect to, or
otherwise co-operate in any way with, any effort or attempt by any other
person (other than Parent or its affiliates) to make or complete an
Acquisition Proposal provided that Thompson may: (A) advise any person
requesting access to non-public information relating to Thompson or its
Subsidiaries that such access cannot be provided unless such person makes an
Acquisition Proposal in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and (B)
advise any person making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that
such Acquisition Proposal does not constitute or could not reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal when the Board has so determined,
(iii) effect a Change in Recommendation, or (iv) accept or enter into, or
propose publicly to accept or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, agreement, arrangement or undertaking in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal; provided that nothing contained in this Arrangement Agreement shall
prevent the Board from (A) making a Change in Recommendation, and/or (B)
considering, providing information to a person, negotiating, accepting,
approving, recommending to Thompson Shareholders or entering into an
agreement, in each case in respect of a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal received at any time prior to obtaining Shareholder Approval, in each
case solely in the manner and under the circumstances set forth in this
Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, as the case may be, and in each case where the
Acquisition Proposal in question: 

---|---|--- -  78  - 



 



     |

(a)

 |

did not result from a breach of any agreement between the person making such
Acquisition Proposal and Thompson or any of its Subsidiaries, or this Section
7.01; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(b)

 |

is not subject to a due diligence condition; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(c)

 |

involves the acquisition of (or, in the case of a take-over bid, an offer for)
not less than all of the outstanding Thompson Shares on a fully diluted basis
or all or substantially all of the assets of Thompson; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(d)

 |

in respect of which the Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its financial advisors and its external legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and 

---|---|--- 



     |

(e)

 |

in respect of which the Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its financial advisors and its external legal
counsel would, if consummated in accordance with its terms (but not assuming
away any risk of non-completion), result in a transaction that: (A) is
reasonably capable of completion in accordance with its terms without undue
delay, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of such Acquisition Proposal and the person making such Acquisition Proposal;
(B) is more favourable from a financial point of view to Thompson Shareholders
than the Arrangement (after giving effect to any changes to the terms and
conditions of this Arrangement Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 7.02), taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal
and the person making such Acquisition Proposal; and (C) is not subject to any
financing condition and in respect of which any required financing to complete
such Superior Proposal has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Board, acting in good faith, is reasonably likely to be obtained 

---|---|--- 

(any such Acquisition Proposal that satisfies all of the foregoing clauses
being referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal").



     |

(2)

 |

Thompson shall, and shall cause the officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents of Thompson and its Subsidiaries to,
immediately terminate any existing discussions or negotiations with any
parties (other than Parent) with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to constitute, an Acquisition Proposal, and, in
connection therewith, Thompson shall discontinue access of such person to the
Thompson Data Room (and not establish or allow access to any other data rooms,
virtual or otherwise or otherwise furnish information). Thompson shall
immediately request the return or destruction of all information provided to
any third party which has entered into a confidentiality agreement with
Thompson relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal to the extent that such
information has not previously been returned or  

---|---|--- -  79  - 



      |

 destroyed, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
such requests are honoured. Thompson agrees not to release any third party
from, and shall enforce, any confidentiality agreement relating to a
potential Acquisition Proposal to which such third party is a party. Thompson
further agrees that neither it, nor any of its Subsidiaries, shall terminate,
waive, amend or modify, and agrees to actively prosecute and enforce, its
rights under any agreement containing a standstill provision and any provision
of any existing confidentiality agreement or any standstill agreement to which
it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. 

---|--- 
 



     |

(3)

 |

Thompson shall immediately (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt by
Thompson) notify Parent of, at first orally and then in writing, of
any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case received after the
date hereof of which any of its directors or officers become aware, or any
amendments to the foregoing, or any request for non-public information
relating to Thompson or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of
Thompson or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that informs Thompson or
any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal and any amendment thereto and a description of the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and shall provide
the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry
and such other details of the proposal or inquiry as Parent may reasonably
request. Thompson shall keep Parent fully informed of the status, including
any change to the material terms, of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry. 

---|---|--- 



     |

(4)

 |

If, prior to receipt of the Shareholder Approval, Thompson receives a written
request for material non-public information from a person who proposes an
unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, and the Board determines in good
faith, after consideration with its financial advisers and external counsel,
that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to
(assuming completion of a due diligence review not exceeding 15 days from the
date of Thompson first determining that it is permitted to disclose non-public
information to such person making the Acquisition Proposal under this Section
7.01(4) (the "Restricted Period")), if consummated in accordance with its
terms, a Superior Proposal, then, and only in such case, following compliance
with Section 7.01(3), the Board may, subject to the execution by such person
of a confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains provisions that
are no less favourable to Thompson than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and provided that such confidentiality and standstill agreement may
not include any provisions calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with
Thompson and may not restrict Thompson or its Subsidiaries from complying with
this Section 7.01, provide such person with access in accordance with
subsection (1) to information regarding Thompson for a period of review not
to exceed the Restricted Period; provided, however that the person making the
Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded thereunder from making the
Acquisition Proposal, and provided further that Thompson sends a correct and
complete copy of any such confidentiality and 

---|---|--- -  80  - 



      |

 standstill agreement to Parent immediately upon its execution and before any
such non-public information is provided and Parent is immediately provided
with a list and copies of all information provided to such person not
previously provided to Parent and is immediately provided with access to
information similar to that which was provided to such person. 

---|--- 
 



     |

(5)

 |

Thompson shall ensure that its officers and directors and those of its
Subsidiaries and any financial or other advisors or representatives
retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section, and it shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section by any such person or its advisors
or representatives. 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(6)

 |

Nothing contained in this Arrangement Agreement shall prohibit the Board from
making any disclosure to Thompson Shareholders, responding through
a directors circular or otherwise as required by applicable Securities Laws
to any Acquisition Proposal or from calling and holding a meeting of Thompson
Shareholders requisitioned by Thompson Shareholders in accordance with the
CBCA or ordered to be held by a court pursuant to the CBCA, in each case
prior to the Effective Date if required under applicable Laws. 

---|---|--- 



   

7.02

 |

_Right to Match_ 

---|--- 



     |

(1)

 |

Subject to Section 7.02(2), Thompson covenants that it will not accept,
approve, recommend or enter into any agreement in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality and standstill agreement permitted by
Section 7.01(4)) or effect a Change in Recommendation unless: 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(a)

 |

an Acquisition Proposal has been made that the Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and external legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(b)

 |

Thompson has complied with its obligations under Section 7.01 and the other
provisions of this Article 7; 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(c)

 |

Thompson has provided Parent with a notice in writing that there is a Superior
Proposal together with all documentation comprising the Superior Proposal; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(d)

 |

a period (the "Response Period") of four Business Days shall have elapsed from
the date on which Parent received the entirety of the documentation set forth
in the prior paragraph, and, if Parent has proposed to amend the terms of the
Arrangement in accordance with Section 7.02(2), the Board shall have
determined, in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
external legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal
compared to the terms of the Arrangement after giving effect to any offer to
amend the terms of the Arrangement made by Parent in accordance with Section
7.02(2); 

---|---|--- -  81  - 



 



     |

(e)

 |

Thompson terminates this Arrangement Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(1)(e);
and 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(f)

 |

Thompson has previously, or concurrently will have, paid to Parent the
Termination Payment. 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(2)

 |

During the Response Period, Parent will have the right, but not the
obligation, to offer to amend the terms of the Arrangement, and Thompson
shall co-operate with Parent with respect thereto, including negotiating in
good faith with Parent to enable Parent to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement as Parent
deems appropriate and as would enable Parent to proceed with the Arrangement
and any related transactions on such adjusted terms. The Board will review in
good faith any such offer by Parent to amend the terms of the Arrangement,
including an increase in, or modification of, the consideration to be
received by the Thompson Shareholders, to determine whether the Acquisition
Proposal to which Parent is responding would be a Superior Proposal when
assessed against the Arrangement as Parent has offered to amend it. If the
Board does not so determine, the Board will promptly reaffirm its
recommendation to Thompson Shareholders to vote in favour of the Arrangement
Resolution and enter into an amended Arrangement Agreement with Parent
reflecting Parents offer to amend the terms of the Arrangement. 

---|---|--- 



     |

(3)

 |

If Thompson provides Parent with notice under Section 7.02(1) on a date that
is less than three Business Days before the date of the Special Meeting,
subject to applicable Laws, Thompson shall postpone or adjourn the Special
Meeting to a date that is at least three Business Days but not more than 10
Business Days after the scheduled date of the Special Meeting.  

---|---|--- 



     |

(4)

 |

Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of
such consideration) to be received by the holders of Thompson Shares shall
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 7.02
and Parent shall be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each such
Acquisition Proposal.  

---|---|--- 



   

7.03

 |

_Agreement as to Damages_ 

---|--- 



     |

(1)

 |

Notwithstanding any other provision relating to the payment of fees, including
the payment of brokerage fees, if after the execution of this Arrangement
Agreement the Arrangement is not consummated because: 

---|---|--- 



     |

(a)

 |

Parent shall have terminated this Arrangement Agreement pursuant to Section
8.02(1)(d); 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(b)

 |

(i) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been made public or proposed
publicly to Thompson or to the Thompson Shareholders after the date hereof
and prior to the Special Meeting; (ii) this Arrangement 

---|---|--- -  82  - 



      |

 Agreement is terminated pursuant to either Section 8.02(1)(a)(ii) or Section
8.02(1)(a)(iii); and (iii) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated within a
period of six months from the exercise of such termination rights (whether or
not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in
clause (i) above); provided that for the purposes of this Section 7.03(1)(b),
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 1.01, except that references to "20%" shall be deemed to
be "50%"; 

---|--- 
 



     |

(c)

 |

Parent shall have terminated this Arrangement Agreement pursuant to Section
8.02(1)(b) on the basis that Thompson intentionally and materially breached
its obligations under any of Sections 2.02, 2.07, 2.08, 7.01 or 7.02 of this
Arrangement Agreement; or 

---|---|--- 



     |

(d)

 |

Thompson shall have terminated this Arrangement Agreement pursuant to Section
8.02(1)(e), 

---|---|--- 
 

then Thompson shall pay to Parent, within two Business Days of the first to
occur of (a), (b) and (c) above (or, in the case of (d) contemporaneously or
prior to such termination), the amount of $156.5 million (the "Termination
Payment") as liquidated damages in immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent. 



     |

(2)

 |

Each Party acknowledges that the payment amount set out in this Section 7.03
is a payment of liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the
damages which Parent will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise
to such damages and the resultant termination of this Arrangement Agreement
and is not a penalty. Thompson irrevocably waives any right it may have to
raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that, subject to Article 8,
payment of the amounts determined pursuant to this Section 7.03 in the manner
provided in respect thereof is the sole monetary remedy of Parent, provided
however that payment by Thompson of the amounts required to be paid pursuant
to Section 7.03 shall not be in lieu of any damages or any other payment or
remedy available in the event of any wilful or intentional breach by Thompson
of any of its obligations under this Arrangement Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



   

7.04

 |

_Fees and Expenses_ 

---|--- 

Subject to Subsection 5.05(9), each Party shall pay all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this Arrangement Agreement
and the Arrangement.

 



   

7.05

 |

_Access to Information; Confidentiality_ 

---|--- 
 

From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Arrangement Agreement, Thompson shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
independent auditors, accounting advisers and agents to, afford to -  83  - 



 

 Parent and to the officers, employees, agents and representatives of Parent
such access as Parent may reasonably require at all reasonable times,
including for the purpose of facilitating integration business planning and
Parents financing of this transaction, to their officers, employees, agents,
properties, books, records and Contracts, and shall furnish Parent with all
data and information Parent may reasonably request. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that information furnished pursuant to this Section shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.



   

7.06

 |

_Insurance and Indemnification_ 

---|--- 



     |

(1)

 |

From and after the Effective Time, Parent will fulfill, and will cause
Thompson and/or its successors to fulfill and honour in all respects
its obligations pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Thompson
and the present and former directors or officers of Thompson or any Subsidiary
thereof (the "Indemnified Parties") in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and any indemnification provisions under the Charter Documents
of Thompson or applicable Laws, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof
and to the extent disclosed in Schedule 7.06 of the Disclosure Letter and
permitted by applicable Laws. Parent shall cause Thompson and/or its
successors to not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the provisions with
respect to exculpation and indemnification contained in the Charter Documents
of Thompson as in effect on the date hereof for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who, prior to the Effective Time, were directors or
officers of Thompson. 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(2)

 |

Prior to the Effective Time, Thompson shall (or if Thompson is unable to,
Parent shall) obtain and pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Thompsons current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO
Insurance") with benefits and levels of coverage not less favourable than
those provided under Thompsons existing policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Arrangement Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby), provided that the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance
shall not exceed $1 million. If Thompson or Parent for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, for a period
of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause Thompson
and/or its successors to, maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by
Thompsons directors and officers liability insurance policy with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
time on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and
officers of Thompson. 

---|---|--- 



     |

(3)

 |

This Section 7.06 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties referred to herein, their heirs and
personal representatives. 

---|---|--- -  84  - 



    

7.07

 |

_Additional Agreements_ 

---|--- 

If this Arrangement Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section
8.02(1), then Thompson shall have the right (the "Thompson Bond Option")
during the period from the time of termination of this Arrangement Agreement
to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the 10th Business Day after the date of
termination of this Arrangement Agreement (the "Thompson Bond Option Period")
to acquire from Parent or any affiliate of Parent all, but not less than
all, of its and their respective right, title and interest in and to the
Thompson Bonds beneficially owned or over which control or direction is
exercised by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (the "Parent Thompson Bonds")
for a purchase price equal to the aggregate acquisition cost of the Parent
Thompson Bonds (the "Thompson Bond Option Exercise Price"), and if the
Thompson Bond Option is exercised in accordance with this Section 7.07, Parent
shall sell and cause any affiliate of Parent to sell to Thompson all of its
and their respective right, title and interest in and to the Parent Thompson
Bonds. The Thompson Bond Option may be exercised by Thompson by providing to
Parent within the Thompson Bond Option Period a notice indicating Thompsons
intent to exercise the Thompson Bond Option (the "Thompson Bond Option
Exercise Notice"). Within 3 Business Days of receipt by Parent of the Thompson
Bond Option Exercise Notice, Parent shall notify Thompson of the aggregate
principal amount, if any, of the Parent Thompson Bonds; the Thompson Bond
Option Exercise Price together with reasonable supporting documentation; and
all necessary particulars in respect of Parents account to which Thompson is
to wire the Thompson Bond Option Exercise Price (the "Thompson Bond Option
Response Notice"). Within 3 Business Days of receipt by Thompson of the
Thompson Bond Option Response Notice, Thompson shall make payment of the
Thompson Bond Option Exercise Price by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in writing by Parent in the Thompson Bond
Option Response Notice. Within 3 Business Days of receipt by Parent of the
Thompson Bond Option Exercise Price, Parent shall, and shall cause its
affiliates as necessary, to deliver to Thompson instruments of conveyance of
all of its and their respective right, title and interest in and to the Parent
Thompson Bonds and such transfers, Thompson Bond certificates, powers of
attorney, evidence of ownership or rights and instruments, as applicable and
as may reasonably be requested by Thompson in furtherance of the foregoing.
During the Thompson Bond Option Period and, to the extent Thompson delivers
to Parent a Thompson Bond Option Exercise Notice, the period thereafter to the
extent that Thompson complies with its obligations under this Section 7.07,
Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its affiliates not to, sell,
transfer, gift, assign, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, convert or otherwise
dispose of any of the Parent Thompson Bonds, or enter into any agreement in
respect of any of the foregoing. The Thompson Bond Option and the benefit of
Parents covenants under this Section 7.07 may be assigned by Thompson to any
person upon not less than 3 Business Days prior written notice by Thompson to
Parent.

or formality: \- 7 -

 



 



     |

(1)

 |

Acquireco shall advance by way of a loan to Thompson an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of cash required by Thompson to acquire for cancellation the
In-The-Money Thompson Options under Section 2.2(3), the In-The-Money Thompson
Warrants under Section 2.2(6), the PSUs under Section 2.2(9) and the Quinto
Rights under Section 2.2(10) and Thompson shall deliver to Acquireco a duly
issued and executed promissory note in the form attached as Appendix A hereto

---|---|---

(2)

 |

Each Thompson Dissent Share shall be transferred by the holder thereof, free

claim against Acquireco in an amount determined and payable in accordance
with Section 4.1(2), and the name of such holder will be removed from the

Shares), and Acquireco shall be recorded as the registered holder of Thompson
Dissent Shares so transferred and shall be the sole legal and beneficial owner
of such Thompson Dissent Shares free and clear of any Liens. 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(3)

 |

Each In-The-Money Thompson Option that is outstanding and has not been duly
exercised prior to the Effective Time shall, without any further action on
behalf of any holder of such In-The-Money Thompson Option and without any
payment except as provided in this Plan of Arrangement, be acquired for
cancellation by Thompson in consideration for a cash payment from Thompson

Consideration exceeds the exercise price per Thompson Share of such In-The-
Money Thompson Option by the number of Thompson Shares underlying such In-The-
Money Thompson Option (the "Option Consideration"), subject to (for greater
certainty) applicable withholdings in accordance with Section 3.7. All In-The-

exercised prior to the Effective Time, other than any Thompson Warrants held
by Acquireco or its affiliates, shall, without any further action on behalf of
any Thompson Warrantholder and without any payment except as provided in this
Plan of Arrangement, be acquired for cancellation by Thompson in consideration
for a cash payment from Thompson equal to the product obtained by multiplying

Thompson Share of such In-The-Money Thompson Warrant by the number of Thompson
Shares underlying such In-The-Money Thompson Warrant (the "Warrant
Consideration"), subject to (for greater certainty) applicable withholdings in
accordance with Section 3.7. All In-The-Money Thompson Warrants issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter
