with the Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent amounts sufficient
in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Such funds may be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable hereunder, and, following any losses, Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. If a holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws its
demand for, or fails to perfect and therefore loses its, appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Dissenting Shares for which the holder of Dissenting Shares has withdrawn
its demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of
Delaware Law and (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to such holder
of Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within ten days
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of shares of Company Stock entitled to receive any
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement (other than any
holder of Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
approved by Parent prior to the Effective Time specifying that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of
certificates representing the shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates")
(or affidavits of loss and indemnity in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.5(e)_ ) or transfer of uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares") to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss and indemnity in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.5(e)_ ) or the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon (A) surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss and indemnity in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.5(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the
terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, or (B) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash
amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.7_ ) equal to (x) the number of
shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.5(e)_ ) or Uncertificated Shares
_multiplied by_ (y) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration set forth in
_Section 2.4(a)_ or _Section 2.4(b)_ , as applicable, and the Certificate so
surrendered and the Uncertificated Shares so transferred shall forthwith
automatically and irrevocably be cancelled and shall no longer be considered
outstanding. No interest will be paid or accrued on any

 



9  amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for
any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued
to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of
Company Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash
amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Company Stockholders for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any holder of shares of Company Stock (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general unsecured
creditor for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.7_ ) upon
due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
due transfer of its Uncertificated Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws.

 

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of loss and indemnity (in customary and reasonable
form) by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such customary and reasonable terms as may be required by
Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, a check in
the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 2.7_ ) equal to the number of shares of Company Stock represented
by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

(f) If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



10 (g) The Per Share Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Stock in respect of which such Per
Share Merger Consideration was paid. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on
or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

 

Section 2.6 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have
properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to receive the "fair value" of such shares of Company Stock
as provided in Section 262 of the Delaware Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, after the Effective Time, any such stockholder of the Company shall fail
to perfect or shall effectively and irrevocably waive, withdraw, or lose such
stockholders rights under Section 262 of the Delaware Law, such
stockholders shares of Company Stock shall no longer be considered Dissenting
Shares for the purposes of this Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any notice received by the Company
of intent to demand appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, withdrawals
of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of
the Delaware Law and received by the Company. Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent or as otherwise required by a final and non-appealable order, decree,
ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment
with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or
settle any such rights.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights _._ _ _ Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, its Subsidiaries and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax law. If the
Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or Parent, as the
case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Stock, in respect of which the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

Section 2.8 Resignations. The Company shall cause each director of the
Company to resign in their capacity as a director of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, such resignations to be effective as of the Closing. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each other director and
officer or equivalent elected or designated person of each of the Companies
requested by Parent in writing prior to the Closing to resign in such
capacity, such resignations to be effective as of the Closing.

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby any restrictions set forth in
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law on business combinations
or the ability to acquire or vote the shares of Company Stock by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Assuming
the accuracy of Parents representations and warranties set forth in _Section
5.4_ , there is no takeover or anti-takeover statute or similar Law, including
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, applicable to this
Agreement, the Platinum Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby that requires additional action by the Company or the board
of directors of the Company in order for any such anti-takeover statute to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



15 Section 4.7 Opinion of Financial Advisor. __ The Special Committee has
received a written opinion of Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., financial advisor
to the Special Committee, to the effect that, as of October 22, 2016, and

Agreement, (i) the Company hereby expressly agrees and acknowledges that
Parent and Merger Subsidiary may rely, and are relying, on the representations
and warranties in this Agreement and in all of the other certificates and
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) nothing in this

Section 6.2 Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to cause Merger

Section 6.3 Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

(a) Commencing with the Effective Time and continuing until the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the same
extent such Indemnified Persons are indemnified as of the time immediately

 



18  prior to the Effective Time by the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries
pursuant to Applicable Law or provided under the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, any equivalent governing documents and any indemnification agreements
of the Company and its Subsidiaries made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event of
any threatened or pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or
informal (each, a "Proceeding"), to which an Indemnified Person is or has been
a party or with respect to which an Indemnified Person is or has been
otherwise involved (including as a witness), arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining in whole or in part to, the fact that the Indemnified Person
is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
an officer or director of another enterprise (including any Proceeding arising
out of or pertaining to matters occurring or existing or alleged to
have occurred or existed, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, or arising out of or pertaining
to this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), then
to the extent provided for in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
equivalent governing documents or any indemnification agreement of the Company
or its applicable Subsidiaries made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof: (i) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
advance fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by each Indemnified Person in
connection with and prior to the final disposition of such Proceedings
as provided in, and in each case, subject to the same exclusions, limitations
and repayment provisions set forth in, the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or equivalent governing documents or any indemnification agreement of
the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries made available to Parent prior to
the date hereof; _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by Delaware Law or
the Surviving Corporations or its applicable Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or equivalent governing documents, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding
in which indemnification is being sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such
action, suit, Proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified Person
otherwise consents in writing. If any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Person in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.3_ , (A) the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time,
(B) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own
counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the
defense of any such Proceeding and (C) the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
extent provided in this _Section 6.3_ , pay all reasonable and documented
fees and expenses of one such counsel (and one local counsel) retained by an
Indemnified Person promptly after statements and reasonable detail therefor
are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such Proceeding.

(b) Commencing at the Effective Time and continuing until the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Parent shall not amend or modify in a manner adverse to the
Indemnified Persons the provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to

 



19  the business of the Surviving Corporation) and in the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and other governing documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries, in each case made available to Parent prior to the date hereof,
regarding (i) elimination of liability of directors, (ii) indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and (iii) advancement of expenses, in each
case as in existence immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium (such premium to be treated as a
"Transaction Expense" (as defined in the Platinum Purchase Agreement) under
the Platinum Purchase Agreement) for the non-cancellable extension of the
insurance coverage (the "Tail Policy") under the Companys existing directors
and officers insurance policies, employment practices liability insurance
policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO
Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of six
years from and after the date hereof with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
coverage provided under the Companys existing DandO Insurance policies (true
and complete copies of which have been made available to Parent prior to the
date hereof) with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay
aggregate premiums for the Tail Policy in excess of 300% of the amount of the
current annual premium of the DandO Insurance (the "Maximum Premium"), but if
they are unable to obtain the Tail Policy for an amount less than or equal to
the Maximum Premium, they shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible in the form of a customary six year "tail policy" on the terms
described in this _Section 6.3_ for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation fail to obtain the Tail
Policy as of the date hereof, subject to the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, from the date hereof, maintain the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement,
act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of
him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby) with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified
Person is or has been a party to or is or has been otherwise involved in any
Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 6.3_ shall continue in effect solely and specifically as they relate
to such Indemnified Person until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



20 (e) If, prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.3_.

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.3_ shall
be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other governing documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under
any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or this _Section 6.3_ to the
contrary, the rights, benefits or privileges set forth in this _Section 6.3_
shall not apply to, inure to the benefit of, or be enforceable by any of the
WLR Entities or any of their Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), or any director of the Company who is a designee or Affiliate
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) of the WLR Entities or any of
their Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), whether in
such Persons capacity as an officer, director or equivalent of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and no such Person shall be deemed an Indemnified
Person; _provided_ _that_ notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly
agreed for the avoidance of doubt that this _Section 6.3(g)_ does not apply
to, or limit any rights of, William Carmichael, John Gildea or Kenneth
Kunberger under this _Section 6.3_.

Section 6.4 No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company set forth in this
Agreement or in any other certificate or document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that
no other representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or
implied, at law or in equity, is made or shall be deemed to have been made by
or on behalf of the Companies with respect to their respective businesses,
affairs, assets, liabilities, financial conditions, results of operations or
prospects or with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any other
information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary by or
on behalf of the Companies, and the Company hereby disclaims any such
representation or warranty, whether by or on behalf of the Companies, and
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or
any of their Representatives or Affiliates of any documentation or other
information by any of the Companies or any of their Representatives or
Affiliates with respect to any one or more of the foregoing. Neither any of
the Companies nor any of their Representatives or Affiliates will have or be
subject to any liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any
other Person resulting from the distribution in written or verbal
communications to Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any such information,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material
made available to Parent or to Merger Subsidiary in online "data rooms,"
confidential information memoranda or management interviews and presentations
except as set forth in this Agreement, the Platinum Purchase Agreement or in
any other certificate or document contemplated therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the

 



21  Companies hereby expressly agrees and acknowledges that Parent and Merger
Subsidiary may rely, and are relying, on the representations and warranties in
this Agreement and in all of the other certificates and documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) nothing in this Agreement or any of the
other certificates or documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
limit any right or remedy of Parent or Merger Subsidiary with respect to
fraud.

enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby

exclusively in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other

the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts

this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement
by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient
to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

Section 10.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all other
agreements, documents and instruments contemplated herein (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Platinum Purchase Agreement (which the Parties
acknowledge the Company is not a party thereto) and the documents and

Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of

remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith

closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

Section 10.13 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof (and, more specifically, that irreparable
damage would occur if the Merger were not consummated and the Company
Stockholders did not receive the aggregate applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms but subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, including the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
to closing set forth in _Article IX_ ) and that the Parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the Parties obligation to consummate the Merger and Parents
obligation to pay, and the Company Stockholders right to receive, the
aggregate applicable Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger,
subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing set forth in
_Article IX_ ) in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, and the Parties further waive any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond or proof of actual damages in
connection with any such remedy.
