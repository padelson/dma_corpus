payment obligation is calculated with respect to a period that ends on the
Closing Date (e.g., by taking the volume of commodities or other product
required to be delivered by Seller during the one-year period in which the
Closing occurs and multiplying such volume by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days from the September 1 immediately preceding the
Closing Date through the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is 365 and calculating the volume of commodities or other
product actually delivered or credited as delivered in accordance with the
Connection Agreement during the period from the September 1 immediately
preceding the Closing Date through the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date and calculating the deficiency payment accordingly)), (k) liabilities
and obligations of Seller to third parties arising prior to the Effective Time
from the 42-mile replacement project on the Pipeline System, and (l) those
liabilities of Seller listed on _Schedule 1.4_. For the avoidance of doubt,

Seller Note, the Merrill Lynch Agreements and the Sellers debtor-in-
possession financing are Excluded Liabilities.

1.5. _Delayed Conveyance of Certain Property_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
not be obligated to assign, transfer, or convey (or cause to be assigned,
transferred, or conveyed) to Buyer any Delayed Acquired Asset or Delayed
Assumed Liability until such time as all Legal Impediments are removed and/or
all Consents necessary for the legal transfer and/or assumption thereof are
obtained or delivered in respect of such Delayed Acquired Asset or Delayed
Assumed Liability, as applicable; _provided_ that, for all purposes of this
_Section 1.5_, if the Bankruptcy Code (including Section 365 thereof) permits
the assignment, transfer or conveyance without any other removal of any
Legal Impediment or the obtaining or delivering of any such Consent, then the
Parties shall take whatever action is reasonably necessary under the
Bankruptcy Code to cause the assignment, transfer and conveyance of such
Delayed Acquired Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability as of the Closing Date
without such separate removal of any such Legal Impediment or such separate
obtaining or delivery of any such Consent and such asset or liability, as the
case may be, shall be transferred on the Closing Date and without regard to
the other provisions of this _Section 1.5_. Following such assignment,
transfer, and conveyance of any Delayed Acquired Asset, or the assumption of
any Delayed Assumed Liability, the applicable Delayed Acquired Asset or
Delayed Assumed Liability shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as an "Acquired Asset" or as an "Assumed Liability," as the case may be, and
shall no longer be a "Delayed Acquired Asset" or a "Delayed Assumed
Liability". For all purposes hereof, unless otherwise waived in writing by
Seller or transferred, assigned or conveyed as provided in this _Section
1.5(a)_, "Acquired Assets" shall not include any Delayed Acquired Asset and
"Assumed Liabilities" shall not include any "Delayed Assumed Liability" until
the Legal Impediments are removed and/or all Consents necessary for the legal
transfer and/or assumption thereof are obtained or delivered in respect of
such Delayed Acquired Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability.



 

7 (b) To the extent permitted by Law and to the extent otherwise permissible in
light of any Legal Impediment or required Consent, if the transfer,
assignment or conveyance or assumption of any Delayed Acquired Asset or any
Delayed Assumed Liability intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed
hereunder is not consummated on the Closing Date, then Seller shall
thereafter hold such Delayed Acquired Asset or such Delayed Assumed Liability
for the use and benefit, to the extent it may lawfully do so, of Buyer (at the
expense of Buyer). In addition, to the extent permitted by law and to the
extent otherwise permissible in light of any Legal Impediment or required
Consent, Seller shall take such other actions in order to place Buyer, to the
extent it may lawfully do so, in the same position as if such Delayed
Acquired Asset or such Delayed Assumed Liability had been transferred,
assigned or conveyed or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the
benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed Acquired Asset or such Delayed
Assumed Liability, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for
gain, and dominion, control and command over such asset, are to inure from,
and after the Closing Date to Buyer. To the extent permitted by law and to the
extent otherwise permissible in light of any Legal Impediment or required
Consent, Buyer shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the
management and the benefits and burdens of any Delayed Acquired Asset or any
Delayed Assumed Liability not yet transferred to or assumed by it as a result
of this _Section 1.5_, and, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree to use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate and coordinate with respect to obtaining any Consent or removing any
Legal Impediment, including by providing any financial information and pro
forma financial information of the relevant party and its Affiliates
reasonably required by the party from whom a Consent is sought to be obtained
or from whom a Legal Impediment is sought to be removed. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that, until a Delayed Assumed Liability is assumed by Buyer,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from such Delayed Assumed
Liability. Nothing herein shall require Seller to expend any money or
commence any litigation to obtain the removal of any Legal Impediment or
obtain any required Consent.

(c) If and when the Legal Impediments and the Consents, the failure to remove
or the absence of which caused the deferral of the transfer or assumption of
any Delayed Acquired Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability, are removed or
obtained, as the case may be, the transfer and assumption of the applicable
Delayed Acquired Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability shall be promptly effected
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or any other applicable
Ancillary Agreements, without the payment of additional consideration.

(d) In connection with Sellers retention of a Delayed Acquired Asset or
Delayed Assumed Liability due to the deferral of the transfer or assumption
of such Delayed Acquired Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability pursuant to this
_Section 1.5_, Seller shall not be obligated to expend any money, unless the
necessary funds are advanced by Buyer.

do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the

properties or assets is subject.

5.4. _Consents, Approvals and Notifications_. The execution, delivery and

5.5. _Financing_. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer will have sufficient
funds available to finance and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to perform its obligations

ARTICLE 6

COVENANTS OF SELLER  

Seller hereby covenants to Buyer as follows:

6.1. _Conduct of Business Before the Closing Date_. Without the prior written
consent of Buyer or, without any request to do so by Seller or any of its
Related Person unless consented to by Buyer, the authorization of the
Bankruptcy Court after notice and a hearing, between the date hereof through
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, except as required or expressly permitted
pursuant to the terms hereof or of any Ancillary Agreement, make any material
change in the Acquired Assets, taken as a whole, or enter into any material
transaction other than an Alternative Transaction, in each case other than in
the Ordinary Course of Business. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as may be required by the  



 

19  Bankruptcy Court without any request to do so from Seller or its Related
Persons, from the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to operate the Pipeline System and conduct
the Business in substantially the same manner as conducted by Seller in the
Ordinary Course of Business, taking into account business exigencies arising
as a result of Sellers financial condition, cash position and status as a
filer under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and Seller shall not enter into,
amend or terminate any transportation, terminaling or interconnection
agreements, or any other Material Contracts that are part of the Acquired
Assets or file any revised tariffs without Buyers prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_
that Seller may enter into or amend such agreements in the Ordinary Course of
Business if the term of such agreement or amendment is less than sixty days.
Seller shall not be obligated to make any capital expenditures related to any
expansion of the capacity of the Pipeline System. To the extent permitted by
the Bankruptcy Court, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
undertake any capital expenditures for the expansion of pipeline capacity
currently contemplated in Sellers annual budget and reasonably requested by
Buyer if and to the extent that Buyer provides all funds necessary to
undertake such activities, including for the procurement of equipment and
third party services.

6.2. _Obligations of Seller after Entry of Sale Order_. From and after the
date that the Sale Order is entered, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, and Seller shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, intentionally take any
action that is reasonably likely to prevent or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby unless otherwise required by the
Bankruptcy Court or Law. Without limiting or amending any covenant or
agreement of Seller under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement which is
not qualified by "reasonable best efforts", when a covenant or agreement
requires that Seller use its "reasonable best efforts", such covenant or
agreement shall not require Seller or any of its Related Person to expend any
money to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, to
commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, to offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party, to obtain any
Consent required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or to provide financing to Buyer for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, if Seller or any of its Affiliates
remedies such breach prior to the Closing, Seller shall not be deemed to be in
breach of such representation or warranty, or in violation of any covenant,
for purposes of determining Buyers obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.3. _Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality_. Prior to the
Closing Date, unless an Alternative Transaction is approved in accordance with
the Bidding Procedures, Seller shall afford to Buyer and to the accountants,
counsel and representatives of Buyer, reasonable access during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Closing Date (or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 13_ ) to all books and
records of Seller relating exclusively to the Business for purposes of
assisting in the transition of the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities to
the Buyer at the Closing if (a) permitted under Law, (b) such books and
records are not subject to confidentiality agreements, (c) disclosing such
books and records would not adversely affect any attorney client privilege,
work product or similar privilege and (d) such books and records do not relate
to any confidential proprietary models or other information of Seller or any
of its Affiliates pertaining to project evaluation, price curves or  



 

20  projections or other economic or other predictive models. Upon reasonable
prior notice, Seller shall also afford Buyer reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to the Business, to all operations of the Business and
to all Acquired Assets throughout the period prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of assisting in the transition of the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities to Buyer at the Closing. The rights of access contained in this
_Section 6.3_ are granted subject to, and on, the following terms and
conditions: (v) any such investigation shall not include physical testing or
samplings and shall be exercised in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operation of the Business; (w) during the period from
the date hereof through the Closing Date, all information provided to Buyer or
its agents or representatives by or on behalf of Seller or their agents or
representatives (whether pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ or otherwise) is
governed by and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February
12, 2009, by and between Flying J and Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "); (x) such rights of access shall not affect or
modify the conditions set forth in _Article 12_ in any way; (y) all such
rights of access are at Buyers sole cost, expense and risk; and Buyer shall
indemnify Seller for any damages, suits, claims, proceedings, fines,
judgments, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and incidental,
consequential or punitive damages) that Seller or any third party may suffer
as a result of Buyers exercise of its rights under this _Section 6.3_; and
(z) Buyer shall comply with and adhere to all of Sellers safety policies and
procedures.

6.4. _Rejection of Assigned Contracts_. Seller shall not reject any Assigned
Contracts pursuant to the Chapter 11 Case without the prior written consent
of Buyer.

6.5. _Casualty Loss_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, before the Closing (a) all or any portion of the Acquired
Assets is condemned or taken by eminent domain, or (b) a material portion is
damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, Seller shall notify Buyer
promptly in writing of such fact. In the case of condemnation or taking,
Seller shall assign or pay, as the case may be, any proceeds thereof to Buyer
at the Closing, and in the case of fire or other casualty, Seller shall either
restore such damage or assign the insurance proceeds therefrom to Buyer at
Closing. If Seller chooses to assign the insurance proceeds to Buyer, Seller
agrees that the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the
deductible for the insurance policy paying proceeds to Seller for such loss
(with Buyer being responsible for payment of such deductible).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ do not in
any way modify Buyers other rights under this Agreement, including any
applicable right to terminate this Agreement if any condemnation, taking,
damage or other destruction resulted in a Material Adverse Effect.

6.6. _Provision of Data; Transfer of Software_. Seller agrees to cooperate
with such reasonable requests during normal business hours as Buyer may make
prior to and following the Closing (which requests shall not interfere in any
material respect with the responsibilities of the Business Employees), so as
to assist Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense, with the integration, from
and after the Closing, of the existing operational data, software and systems
relating to the Pipeline System into Buyers software and systems.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer is
not acquiring any software or any computer or other electronic equipment
transferred to Buyer as part of the Acquired Assets, unless and only to the
extent that Buyer or Seller have obtained prior to the Closing any necessary
licenses or rights to use such software from and after the Closing. Seller
also agrees to cooperate with such reasonable requests during normal
business hours as Buyer may make in  



 

21  order to facilitate Buyers acquisition of such licenses or rights, at no
cost to Seller, but neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall have
any obligation to assist Buyer to retain the services of any other Person, or
to obtain any services provided by any such Person to support software or
systems at any particular cost.

6.7. _Further Assurances_. Upon the request and at the sole expense of Buyer
at any time after the Closing Date (but without additional consideration),
Seller shall execute and deliver such documents as Buyer or its counsel may
reasonably request to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, if at any time on or after the
Closing, Seller or any of its Related Persons comes into possession or
control of any Acquired Assets, Seller shall, subject in all respects to
_Section 1.5_ with respect to Delayed Acquired Assets, promptly but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after coming into possession or
control, return such Acquired Assets to Buyer for no additional consideration.

6.8.  _Seller s Obligation to Perform_. Seller shall pay, perform and
discharge all Excluded Liabilities in accordance with Sellers plan of
reorganization or liquidation and as permitted by the Bankruptcy Court, as
applicable, and will indemnify and hold Buyer and each of Buyers Related
Persons harmless as provided in _Article 14_ for any and all Losses suffered
by Buyer or any of its Related Persons from breach of the covenants and
agreements of Seller in this  _Section 6.8_.

6.9. _Title Insurance_. At or prior to Closing, Buyer may obtain, at its sole
cost and expense, extended coverage ALTA owners policies of title insurance
or other title insurance policy insuring fee title in Buyer to the Owned Real
Property. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in obtaining such policies,
including cooperating with Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to obtain
or extend an abstract for the Owned Real Property and to obtain surveys of the
Owned Real Property necessary to obtain such policies. In no event shall the
Closing be delayed or prevented by operation of this _Section 6.9_.

ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF BUYER

Buyer hereby covenants to Seller as follows:

7.1. _Actions Before Closing Date_. Subject to the express provisions of this
Agreement, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts (a) to perform and satisfy
all conditions to each of Buyers and Sellers obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are to be performed or
satisfied by Buyer under this Agreement and (b) for the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable and Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, intentionally take any action that is reasonably likely to
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting or amending any covenant or agreement of Buyer under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement which is not qualified by "reasonable
best efforts", when a covenant or agreement requires that Buyer use its
"reasonable best efforts", such covenant or agreement shall not require Buyer
or any of its Related Persons to expend any money to remedy any breach of any
representation or warranty hereunder (other than the representations or
warranties set forth in _Section 5.5_ and _Section 5.6_), to commence any
litigation or arbitration proceeding, to offer or grant any accommodation  



 

22  (financial or otherwise) to any third party, to obtain any Consent required
for the transactions contemplated hereby or to sell or agree to sell any of
the Acquired Assets or any assets owned by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

7.2. _Consents_. Buyer acknowledges that certain Consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to Assigned
Contracts to which Seller and/or its Affiliates are party and that such
Consents have not been obtained and may not be obtained. Buyer agrees that
neither Seller nor any of Sellers Related Persons shall have any liability
whatsoever to Buyer (and Buyer shall not be entitled to assert any claims)
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consents that may have
been, or may be, required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or because of the default, acceleration or termination of or
loss of right under any such contract, lease, license or other agreement as a
result of such failure. Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty
or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached
and no condition of Buyer shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of
the failure to obtain any Consent, as a result of any default, acceleration
or termination or loss of right resulting from such failure, or as a result of
any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any Consent or any default, acceleration or termination or
loss of right resulting from such failure. Subject to the foregoing, at
Buyers written request prior to the Closing, if such Consent is required
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable manner in connection with Buyers
obtaining any such Consents; _provided_ that such cooperation shall not
include any requirement of Seller or any of its Affiliates to expend money,
commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

7.3. _Adequate Assurances Regarding Assigned Contracts_. With respect to each
Assigned Contract, to the extent required by the Bankruptcy Court, Buyer
shall provide the Bankruptcy Court, Seller or the counterparty to any such
Contract, as the case may be, adequate assurance of the future performance of
such Assigned Contract by Buyer.

7.4. _Cure of Defaults_. Except as provided below, Buyer shall, on or prior to
the Closing, cure (or, to the extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Code,
segregate funds sufficient to cure) any and all defaults under the Assigned
Contracts that are required to be cured under the Bankruptcy Code, so that
such Contracts may be assumed by Seller and assigned to Buyer in accordance
with the provisions of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Notwithstanding
the forgoing, Buyer shall not be obligated to pay more than the Buyer Cure
Cost Obligations to cure any such defaults. On the Closing Date, Seller shall
pay or, to the extent permitted by the Sale Order, segregate funds sufficient
to pay, the Seller Cure Cost Obligations.

7.5. _Support Obligations_. 

(a) Buyer recognizes that Seller may have provided credit support with respect
to the Acquired Assets (collectively, the " _Support Obligations_ "). As
promptly as practicable after the Sale Order is entered by the Bankruptcy
Court, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to effect the full and unconditional
release of Seller from any and all Support Obligations identified by Seller
to Buyer by:

(i) furnishing letters of credit containing terms and conditions that
are substantially identical to the terms and conditions of existing letters
of credit and from lending institutions that are either investment grade
institutions or have a credit rating commensurate with or better than that of
lending institutions for existing letters of credit;



 

23 (ii) instituting escrow arrangements with terms equal to, or more favorable to
the counterparty than, the terms of existing escrow arrangements;

(iii) posting surety or performance bonds issued by an institution having a
credit rating at least equal to those of the issuer of existing surety or
performance bonds, and which replacement surety or performance bonds contain
terms and conditions that are substantially identical to the terms
and conditions of existing surety or performance bonds; and

(iv) providing substitute guaranties.

(b) Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause the beneficiary or
beneficiaries of the Support Obligations to terminate and redeliver to
Seller, prior to the Closing, each original copy of each original guaranty,
letter of credit or other instrument constituting or evidencing such Support
Obligations, to redeliver to Seller any cash collateral in respect of the
Support Obligations and, as to any Support Obligations terminated after the
Closing, promptly to redeliver such originals or cash to Seller, and in each
case, to take such other actions as may be required to terminate such Support
Obligations.

 

(c) If Buyer is not successful in obtaining the complete and unconditional
release of Seller from the Support Obligations prior to the Closing, then
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any
and all costs, expenses, reimbursements or performance incurred by Seller in
connection with the Support Obligations. Buyer shall, for so long as any
Support Obligation remains outstanding, not effect any amendments or
modifications or any other changes to the agreements, guaranties or letters of
credit to which any of such Support Obligations relate, or otherwise take any
action that would effect any change to such agreements, guaranties or letters
of credit without Sellers prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right
to contact and have discussions with each beneficiary of a Support Obligation
in order to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 7.5_; _provided_ that
(i) Buyer shall give Seller prior notice before making any such contact and
(ii) Seller shall have the right to have one of its representatives present
on the telephone line or in person, as applicable, during any such contact or
discussion.

7.6. _Availability of Business Records_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide to Seller and its Related Persons (after reasonable notice and during
normal business hours and without charge to Seller) access to all
Business Records for periods prior to the Closing and shall preserve such
Business Records until the later of (a) six (6) years after the Closing Date
and (b) the required retention period for all Government contact information,
records or documents.  



 

24  Such access includes access to any information in electronic form to the
extent reasonably available. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has the right to
retain originals or copies of Business Records for periods prior to the
Closing. Prior to destroying any Business Records for periods prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall notify Seller thirty (30) days in advance of any such
proposed destruction of its intent to destroy such Business Records, and
Buyer will permit Seller to retain such Business Records. With respect to any
litigation and claims that are Excluded Liabilities, Buyer shall, at Sellers
expense, render all reasonable assistance that Seller may request in
defending such litigation or claim and shall make available to Seller
personnel most knowledgeable about the matter in question. If, after the
Closing, Buyer (or any Affiliate or creditor of Buyer) receives any payment
or revenue that belongs to Seller pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall
promptly remit or cause to be remitted the same to Seller without set-off or
deduction of any kind or nature.

7.7. _Flying J Marks_. Buyer agrees that, within thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall (a) remove, obliterate, cover or replace, as
appropriate, all signs, billboards, containers, drums, advertisements or other
media containing any service marks, trade names, trade dress or other indicia
of origin of Flying J or any of Sellers Affiliates (other than Longhorn) and
(b) return to Seller or, at Sellers option, destroy (and certify such
destruction to Seller) all items and materials, including stationery,
letterhead and purchase orders, located on any of the Acquired Assets
containing the above described marks. In addition, Buyer agrees that, within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall replace all signs located

(a) Buyer shall pay, perform and discharge all Assumed Liabilities when due or
required and will indemnify and hold Seller and each of Sellers Related
Persons harmless as provided in _Article 14_ for any and all Losses suffered
by Seller or any of its Related Persons from breach of the covenants and
agreements of Buyer in this _Section 7.8(a)_.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that certain litigation, namely the Tanner
Litigation, the Valero Litigation and the Kinder Morgan Litigation,
pertaining to the Business and the Pipeline System is being retained by
Seller. Buyer shall, at the written request of Seller and at Sellers cost and
expense, cooperate with Seller in its pursuit, prosecution, and/or defense of
any Claim related to the Tanner Litigation, the Valero Litigation, the Kinder
Morgan Litigation or other litigation that may be instituted by or against
Seller or its Related Persons related to the Business, the Pipeline System or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including by making individuals
available to provide testimony or information in connection therewith and to
make Books and Records available for review, inspection and, as necessary,
production.

(c) Buyer also acknowledges that there are certain issues between Seller and
Longhorn Pipeline Investors, LLC (the " _Seller Note Holder_ ") concerning
the August 17, 2006 Membership Interests Purchase Agreement between Seller and
the Seller Note Holder and Claims arising thereunder. Buyer shall, at the
written request of Seller or the  



 

25  Seller Note Holder, cooperate with Seller and/or the Seller Note Holder with
respect to obtaining information related to such issues, including by making
individuals available to provide information in connection therewith and to
make relevant Business Records available for review, inspection and, as
necessary, production; _provided_ that Buyer shall have no obligation under
this  _Section 7.8(c)_ unless the party for whom such information is being
made available has agreed in a writing addressed to Buyer to reimburse Buyer
for its out-of-pocket costs and expenses related to its obligations under
this  _Section 7.8(c)_; _provided_ further that Sellers execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall constitute such written agreement by Seller.

7.9. _Further Assurances_. Upon the request and at the sole expense of Seller
at any time after the Closing Date (but without additional consideration),
Buyer shall execute and deliver such documents as Seller or its counsel may
reasonably request to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, if at any time on or after the
Closing Buyer or any of its Related Persons comes into possession or control
of any Excluded Assets (other than Excluded Assets that are the property of
Buyer or its Affiliates as the Operator), Buyer shall promptly but in no event
later than three (3) Business Days after coming into possession or control,
return such Excluded Assets to Seller for no additional consideration.

7.10. _Financing_.

(a) Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Credit Facility,
including (i) maintaining in effect the Credit Facility and, as applicable,
any Supplemental Facility without amendment after the date hereof, (ii)
negotiating, executing and delivering all documents required under the Credit
Facility and, as applicable, any Supplemental Facility to borrow under the
Credit Facility and, as applicable, any Supplemental Facility to receive the
Financing or otherwise required with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Financing in the Credit Facility and, as
applicable, any Supplemental Facility that are within the control of Buyer
and comply with its obligations under the Credit Facility and, as applicable,
any Supplemental Facility, (iv) consummating the Financing at or prior to the
Closing, (v) ensuring sufficient availability thereunder such that, when
taken together with cash on hand, at Closing and without delay for such
availability, the Financing is sufficient to fulfill Buyers obligations under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and (vi) enforcing its rights
under the Credit Facility and, as applicable, any Supplemental Facility in the
event of a breach by the financing sources that impedes or delays the Closing,
including seeking specific performance of the parties thereunder. Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons
providing such Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (including, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
7.1_ of this Agreement, by taking enforcement action, including seeking
specific performance, to cause such lenders and the other Persons providing
such Financing to fund such Financing). If any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable or Buyer becomes  



 

26  aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing
unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Credit Facility and, as applicable, any Supplemental Facility and such
portion is reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from the same
and/or alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event;  _provided_ that, without
limiting the provisions set forth at all times on and after the date of this
Agreement, Buyer shall maintain, solely for use for its obligations under this
Agreement, available borrowings under its Credit Facility in an amount not
less than $250,000,000. Buyer shall give Seller prompt oral and written notice
(but in any event not later than one (1) Business Day after the occurrence) of
(x) any material breach by any party to the Credit Facility or,
as applicable, any Supplemental Facility, (y) any condition not likely to be
satisfied or (z) any termination of the Credit Facility or, as applicable, any
Supplemental Facility or any obligations to fund thereunder.

(b) As promptly as possible after the date hereof, but in no event later than
the date (the " _FCN Deadline Date_ ") that is the earlier of (x) one
Business Day after Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries raises debt or equity
financing in an amount of not less than $100,000,000 and (y) the Bid Deadline
Date (as defined in the Bid Procedures Order), Buyer shall deliver written
notice to Seller, certified by a senior executive officer on behalf of Buyer
and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, (i) representing
and warranting (without qualification or limitation) to Seller for purposes
of Sellers reliance that Buyer has cash on hand and/or available borrowings
under the Credit Facility and, as applicable, any Supplemental Facility to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (including the Main Line Fill Purchase Agreement and the
Spur Line Fill Purchase Agreement), (ii) covenanting and agreeing with Seller
that, at all times on and after the date of such notice, Buyer shall maintain,
solely for use for its obligations under this Agreement, cash on hand and/or
available borrowings under its Credit Facility and, as applicable, any
Supplemental Facility in an amount not less than that needed to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements at the Closing
and thereafter, (iii) to the extent applicable, making the representations,
warranties, and covenants required by the definition of Supplemental Facility
and (iv) agreeing for the benefit of Seller that such representations,
warranties and covenants are, respectively, representations, warranties and
covenants of Buyer made in, under and pursuant to this Agreement on which
Buyer may rely (a written notice meeting all of such conditions, the " _Funds
Certification Notice_ "). Without limiting or amending any other rights or
remedies to which Seller may be entitled as a result thereof or arising
therefrom, in the event that a Funds Certification Notice is not delivered by
Buyer to Seller on or prior to the FCN Deadline Date, Seller or an Affiliate
thereof may, in its sole discretion, as a non-exclusive remedy, by written
notice to Buyer (a " _Line Fill Termination Notice_ "), elect to terminate
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement to deliver, or cause an
Affiliate to deliver, the Main Line Fill Purchase Agreement and the Spur Line
Purchase Agreement at the Closing.



 

27 (c) In the event that Seller or an Affiliate elects to deliver the Line Fill
Termination Notice, (v) effective immediately upon such delivery,
automatically and without further action on the part of any Party hereto, (A)
_Sections 3.2(a)(i)_ , _3.2(a)(ii)_ , _3.3(c)(i)_ and _3.3(c)(ii)_ of this
Agreement shall be amended and restated as "Intentionally Omitted", (B) the
following shall be deleted from the definition of "Ancillary Agreements": ",
including but not limited to the Main Line Fill Purchase Agreement and
the Spur Line Fill Purchase Agreement", and (C) the following shall be
deleted from the definition of "Main Line Fill": "and as more fully set forth
in the Main Line Fill Purchase Agreement", (w) after giving effect to the
amendments described in the immediately foregoing clause (v), the respective
rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect without delay, (x) Seller shall have the right at any
time either prior to or after the Closing, to, or to permit an Affiliate or
third party on its behalf to, remove the Main Line Fill and the Spur Line Fill
from the Pipeline System at the sole cost and expense of Buyer (whether
incurred prior to or after the Closing) and Buyer shall fully cooperate with
and assist Seller and its Affiliates, as Seller or any Affiliate requests, in
the removal, sale to a third party of, or any financing involving the Main
Line Fill and the Spur Line Fill, (y) Seller shall not be deemed to be in
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this
Agreement as a result of delivery of the Line Fill Termination Notice and (z)
Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for all Losses (without
limitation by _Section 15.17_ of this Agreement) suffered by Seller or any of
its Affiliates arising from or related to failure of Buyer to purchase the
Main Line Fill and the Spur Line Fill when required pursuant to
this Agreement (determined without regard to the Line Fill Termination Notice
and the amendments affected thereby).

(d) In no event shall this _Section 7.10_ be deemed to amend or modify any
representations, warranties or other covenants of Buyer under this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements or be construed that receipt of the
Financing is a condition to Buyers obligations under this Agreement (it
being understood and agreed that, for all purposes of this Agreement, failure
of Buyer to deliver the Purchase Price and, unless a Linefill Termination
Notice has been delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to such time, the purchase
price required under the Main Line Fill Purchase Agreement and the Spur Line
Fill Purchase Agreement (whether delivered or required to be delivered by
Buyer) shall be deemed a willful and intentional breach of this Agreement,
regardless of whether such failure results, in whole or in part from failure
to receive third-party financing).

7.11.  _O andM Agreement; Operational Expenses_.

(a) By its execution and delivery hereof, Operator agrees that the
monthly management fees described in Section 7.1.1 of the OandM Agreement that
were or are required to be paid by Seller or any of its Related Persons to
Operator pursuant to the OandM Agreement on June 15, 2009, July 15, 2009
and August 15, 2009 are deferred and Operator agrees that no breach or
default under the OandM Agreement shall be deemed to have occurred as a result
of a non-payment of such fees on any such date. Any such deferred fees shall
be paid to Operator by reduction, in accordance with _Section 3.3_ of this
Agreement, of the amount that Buyer is required to pay at Closing; _provided_
that if Buyer is not the winning bidder at the Auction, such deferred fees
shall be paid to  



 

28  Operator as a super-priority administrative claim of Seller under the
Bankruptcy Code subordinate in right to payment to Sellers debtor-in-
possession financing and all other super-priority administrative claims of
Seller. Operator acknowledges and agrees that reduction of the amount Buyer is
required to pay at Closing in accordance with _Section 3.3_ of this Agreement
shall be in full satisfaction of Operators rights in respect of the monthly
fees so deferred. The aggregate amount of monthly fees deferred in accordance
with this _Section 7.11_ are referred to herein as the " _Deferred
Fee Amount_ ".

(b) Operator and Seller hereby acknowledge and agree that the OandM Agreement is
hereby terminated, automatically and without further action on the part of
any party thereto, effective as of the Effective Time without further
liability to either Operator or Seller and that the OandM Agreement is hereby
amended to provide for such automatic termination effective as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ that Seller and Operator hereby agree that, without
otherwise limiting such termination of the OandM Agreement, Article 12 of the
OandM Agreement (as amended and restated by the Third Amendment to the OandM
Agreement, the " _O andM Surviving Provisions_") shall survive any such
termination with respect to occurrences prior to the Closing Date. Unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, other than (i) Claims
of Buyer for breach after the date hereof of any OandM Surviving Provision, (ii)
Claims of Buyer for payment of the Deferred Fee Amount in accordance with
_Section 3.3_, and (iii) OandM Surviving Claims which Operator asserts in the
Chapter 11 Case, Buyer and Operator hereby irrevocably waive any Claims that
Buyer or Operator may have with respect to the OandM Agreement and Buyer and
Operator agree that they shall not, and shall cause their Related Persons not
to, file or enforce any proof of claim with respect to, file any objection to
any proposed rejection by Seller of, or assert any other Claim in the Chapter
11 Case or otherwise with respect to the OandM Agreement pursuant to the
Chapter 11 Case and this _Section 7.11_ shall be a complete defense to any
such proof of claim, objection or other Claim. Buyer shall indemnify Seller
and Sellers Related Persons for any Losses of Seller or Sellers Related
Persons arising from or relating to an assertion of a Claim by any Person
arising from the termination or rejection of the OandM Agreement.

acquisition of the Business or any portion thereof, the Acquired Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any

into or perform any agreements or submit to any Orders requiring it to sell or
otherwise dispose of, or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust

Affiliates.



 

32 ARTICLE 11

TAXES AND FEES

11.1. _Taxes Related to Purchase of Assets_. All state and local sales,
use, gross-receipts, transfer, excise, value-added or other similar Taxes
incurred in connection with the transfer of the Acquired Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, and all recording and filing fees that
may be imposed by reason of the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of
the Acquired Assets (collectively, " _Transaction Taxes_ "), shall be paid by
Buyer on or prior to their due date, in all cases to the extent not discharged
by operation of the Bankruptcy Code upon entry of the Sale Order.

11.2. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) cooperate fully with each other and make
available or cause to be made available to each other for consultation,
inspection and copying (at such other Partys expense), in a timely fashion,
such personnel, Tax data, relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof and
filings, files, books, records, documents, financial, technical and operating
data, computer records and other information as may be reasonably required (a)
for the preparation by such other Party of any Tax Returns or (b) in

arises from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

11.3. _Allocation of Purchase Price and Purchase Price Allocation Forms_. The
Purchase Price, the Assumed Liabilities and other relevant items shall be
allocated among the Acquired Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer an allocation schedule setting
forth Sellers determination of the allocation (the " _Allocation Schedule_
") within sixty (60) days after the date hereof, which Allocation Schedule is
subject to the reasonable approval of Buyer. The Allocation Schedule shall
identify the transferor and transferee thereof and shall be prepared in
accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.1060-1 (or any comparable provision of
state or local Tax Law) or any successor provision. The Parties agree that
they will report the federal, state, local and other Tax consequences of the
purchase and sale hereunder (including in filings on IRS Form 8594) in a
manner consistent with such allocation and that they will not take any
position inconsistent therewith in connection with any Tax Return, refund
claim, litigation or otherwise, unless and to the extent required to do so
pursuant to applicable law. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in the filing of
any forms (including Form 8594) with respect to such allocation.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 11.3_
survives any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

11.4. _Prorations_. The items of revenue and expense set forth in this
_Section 11.4_ shall be prorated between the Parties (the "Prorations") as of
the Effective Time, or such other time expressly provided in this _Section
11.4_, so that the Closing Date is a day of income and expense for Buyer.

(a) _Ad valorem Taxes_. Seller shall be responsible to pay all real and
personal property taxes, including penalties and interest thereon, applicable
to the Acquired Assets for any fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which
the Closing occurs. Buyer shall be responsible to pay all real and personal
property taxes applicable to the Acquired Assets for fiscal years subsequent
to the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs. All real and  



 

33  personal property Taxes applicable to the Acquired Assets for the fiscal
year in which Closing occurs will be prorated between the Parties as of
the Effective Time. Sellers allocated share of the real and personal
property Taxes shall be deducted from the Purchase Price at Closing and Buyer
shall assume the responsibility for payment unless the Seller has already paid
such Taxes, in which case Buyers allocated share of such real and personal
property Taxes shall be added to the Purchase Price and paid to Seller at
Closing. If the Closing occurs before the Tax rate is fixed for such fiscal
year, the apportionment of real and personal property Taxes shall be based on
the most recently ascertainable Tax statement provided that the Parties shall
recalculate and re-prorate the Taxes and make the necessary cash adjustments
promptly upon the issuance of the actual tax statements for the fiscal year
in which Closing occurs. This _Section 11.4(a)_ shall survive the Closing.

(b)  _Real Property Leases and Licenses_. Any rents, fees, charges and other
amounts prepaid, accrued or due and payable or to become due and payable for
the calendar year or other portion thereof in which the Closing occurs under
the Real Property Leases and Real Property Licenses shall be prorated as of
the Effective Time between Seller and Buyer.

(c) _Real Property Easements_. Any fees, charges and other amounts prepaid,
accrued or due and payable or to become due and payable for the calendar year
or other portion thereof in which the Closing occurs under the Real Property
Easements shall be prorated as of the Effective Time between Seller and
Buyer.

(d) _Permits and Crossing Permits_. All amounts prepaid, accrued or due and
payable or to become due and payable for the calendar year or other portion
thereof in which the Closing occurs under any Permits and Crossing Permits
transferred to Buyer shall be prorated as of the Effective Time between Seller
and Buyer. Seller shall receive a credit for all deposits made by Seller
under the Permits and Crossing Permits (together with any interest thereon)
which are transferred to Buyer or which remain on deposit for the benefit of
Buyer.

(e) _Utilities_. All utility services shall be prorated as of the Effective
Time between Seller and Buyer. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain readings for all utilities as of the Effective Time. If
readings cannot be obtained as of the Closing Date, the cost of such utilities
shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer by estimating such cost on the
basis of the most recent bill for such service; _provided_ , however, that
after the Closing, the Parties shall re-prorate the amount for such utilities
and pay any deficiency in the original proration to the other Party promptly
upon receipt of the actual bill for the relevant billing period, which
obligation shall survive the Closing.

(f) _Third-Party Tariffs_. To the extent that, prior to the Effective Time,
Seller has collected tariff payments in cash from third-parties (specifically
excluding Flying J, LPI and any other Affiliate of Seller) for transportation
of any batch of petroleum products in the Pipeline System (other than the
spur line from Crane, Texas to Odessa, Texas) (each, a " _Third-Party Batch_
") and, after Closing, Buyer has obligations to  



 

34  continue to transport such Third-Party Batch, such third-party tariff
payments shall be prorated as of the Effective Time (for each such batch, such
tariff so collected, the " _Collected Tariff Amount_ ") as though the Seller
Percentage of such tariff collected on such Third-Party Batch is for the
benefit of, and retained by, Seller and the Buyer Percentage of such tariff
collected on such Third-Party Batch is for the benefit of, and shall be paid
in accordance with this _Section 11.4(f)_ to, Buyer. Seller shall make
payment to Buyer in an amount equal to the Buyer Percentage multiplied by the
Collected Tariff Amount for such Third-Party Batch and Buyer shall be solely
responsible for all custody and transportation obligations of Seller with
respect to each such Third-Party Batch.

(g) _Other Adjustments and Prorations_. All other items of income and expense
as are customarily adjusted or prorated upon the sale and purchase of
property similar to the Acquired Assets shall be adjusted and prorated between
Seller and Buyer accordingly.

(h) _Estimated Prorations_.

(i) On or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer its good faith estimate of the amount due
to or owing by Seller with respect to the matters referred to in this _Section
11.4_ (the " _Estimated Proration Amount_ "), together with reasonable back-
up therefor; _provided_ that, to the extent that, prior to Closing, Buyer
gives written notice to Seller that it disagrees with Sellers calculation of
the Estimated Proration Amount and provides its own good faith calculation of
the Estimated Proration Amount, the "Estimated Proration Amount" shall be (a)
the amount agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller prior to the Closing (without
delay by reason of this _Section 11.4(h)_ or (b) in the absence of such
agreement, the average of the Estimated Proration Amount delivered by Buyer
and the Estimated Proration Amount delivered by Seller. If, after
determination in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the
Estimated Proration Amount (x) is owed by Buyer to Seller, the amount
required to be delivered by Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ shall be
increased accordingly or (y) is owed by Seller to Buyer, the amount required
to be delivered by Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ shall be decreased
accordingly. To the extent that, after the Closing, any amount is required to
be re-prorated in accordance with this _Section 11.4_, to the extent such re-
proration was not taken into account in the calculation of the Estimated
Proration Amount, such amount shall be paid to Buyer or Seller in accordance
with this _Section 11.4_ promptly, but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days, after determination thereof.

(ii) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the originally scheduled
date for the hearing for entry of the Sale Order, Seller shall deliver a
draft of its computation of the Estimated Proration Amount, based on
information then in its possession and assuming the Closing Date is two
Business Days after such hearing is scheduled (or such other date as Buyer
and Seller may agree).



 

35 11.5. _Unbilled Transactional Taxes_. If a Tax assessment is levied upon
Seller or its Affiliates by an authorized Tax jurisdiction for unbilled
Transaction Taxes then Buyer shall reimburse Seller for those Taxes including
any interest and penalty.

been waived by Buyer or, if capable of cure, has not been cured by Seller. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this  _Section 13.3_: (a) the
Deposit, together with any interest accrued thereon less any fees and expenses

terminate this Agreement if there has been a material violation or breach by
Seller of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligation of

Buyer and such violation or breach is not capable of being cured or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (I)
thirty days after written notice  



 

39  thereof from Buyer, or (II) the Final Termination Date; _provided_ that the
right of termination pursuant to this _Section 13.4_ is not available to
Buyer at any time that Buyer has violated or is in breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty hereunder if such breach has prevented satisfaction
of Sellers conditions to Closing hereunder and has not been waived by
Seller or, if capable of cure, has not been cured by Buyer. If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to this _Section 13.4_: (a) the Deposit, together with

13.5.  _Termination on Alternative Transaction_.

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before Closing by
either Buyer or Seller (i) upon or after Sellers execution and delivery of

is designated as the Back-up Bidder at the Auction.

Deposit, together with any interest accrued thereon, less any fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent, shall be returned to Buyer within five (5)
Business Days after such termination ( _provided_ that the interest may not

each of Buyer and Seller shall take all actions necessary to cause such
payment as promptly as practicable after the date of such termination
(including delivery of joint written instructions to such effect), (ii) Seller
shall pay Buyer the Break-Up Fee in accordance with _Section 13.5(c)_, (iii)

(i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 13.5(a)_, Seller
shall pay to Buyer, upon closing of the Alternative Transaction, an amount in
immediately available funds equal to the Break-Up Fee. 

(ii) Sellers obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee pursuant to this _Section
13.5(c)_ survives termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
13.5_ and constitutes an administrative expense of Seller.



 

40 (iii) The Break-Up Fee, payable under the circumstances provided in  _Section
13.5(c)(i)_ constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty and is the
exclusive remedy of Buyer and its Affiliates for any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 13.5_. Buyer shall not, and shall
cause each of its Related Person not to bring any cause of action against or
otherwise seek remedies from, Seller or any of Sellers Related Persons or any
counterparty to an Alternative Transaction or any of such counter partys
Related Persons (other than for payment of the applicable Break-Up Fee when
payable hereunder), whether at equity or in law, for breach of contract, in
tort or otherwise, in the event that this Agreement is terminated for any
reason in accordance with this  _Section 13.5_, and any claim, right or
cause of action by Buyer or any other Person against Seller or its Related
Persons in excess of the applicable Break-Up Fee is hereby fully waived,
released and forever discharged.

(d) If Seller enters into an Alternative Transaction and Buyer is chosen as
the Back-up Bidder, each Partys obligations and rights to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are tolled until either (i) Seller
closes the Alternative Transaction or (ii) Seller informs Buyer that the
Alternative Transaction will not be consummated. Upon notification by Seller
that the Alternative Transaction will not close and Buyer, as Back-up Bidder,
must close the transaction, both Parties shall proceed to the closing of this
transaction in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement shall automatically, and without further
part on any party, be restored in full.

ARTICLE 14

 

INDEMNIFICATION

14.1. _Right to Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article
14_ ), Seller shall indemnify Buyer on behalf of itself and its Related
Persons (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from the Indemnity Escrow
Funds as its sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses relating to (i) Sellers
breach of any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement or in
any Ancillary Agreement, (ii) the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities
(including the KM Pre-Effective Time Deficiency Obligations) and (iii) the
failure of Seller to perform any of its covenants and obligations required to
be performed by it pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Indemnity
Escrow Funds shall be the sole and exclusive source of recovery for any Buyer
Indemnitee for any amounts owing to Buyer for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

(b) Subject to the other terms of this _Article 14_ , from and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
Related Persons (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ " and, together with
the Buyer Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay to the
applicable Seller Indemnitee the amount  



 

41  of, any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to (i)
Buyers breach of any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement and (ii) the failure of Buyer to perform any of its
covenants and obligations required to be performed by it pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

14.2. _Limitations and Other Indemnity Claim Matters_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Article 14_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
from and after the Closing, the following terms shall apply to any claim
related to a Loss pursuant to _Section 14.1_:

(a) _De Minimis_. No indemnifying party (" _Indemnifying Party_ ") will have
any liability under this _Article 14_ in respect of any individual Loss of
less than $20,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Loss_ "). For purposes of
calculating the amount of any individual Loss, Losses resulting from the same
or substantially similar or related set of facts, circumstances, acts,
omissions or occurrences shall be aggregated. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the limitations set forth in this _Section 14.2(a)_ shall not apply to Losses
arising from or related to a Partys breach of any covenant in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement to the extent providing for performance by such
Party at or after the Effective Time.

(b) _Deductible_. No Indemnifying Party will have any liability under
_Section 14.1_ until the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees (as
applicable) have suffered Losses in excess of an aggregate amount equal to
$750,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") arising from Losses under _Section 14.1_,
including De Minimis Losses, and then the recoverable Losses under _Section
14.1_ shall be limited to those that in the aggregate exceed such Deductible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this _Section
14.2(b)_ shall not apply to Losses arising from or related to (i) a Partys
breach of any covenant in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the
extent providing for performance by such Party at or after the Effective Time
(including _Section 11.4_ and the last sentence of _Section 7.4_), (ii) the
rights of the Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification under clause (ii) of
_Section 14.1(a)_ or (iii) any breach of the representations and warranties
in any of the last sentence of _Section 4.11_, the last sentence of _Section
4.12(a)_, _Section 4.14_, or _Section 4.17_.

(c) _Cap_. The aggregate liability of each of Buyer and Seller under this
Agreement and from the transactions contemplated hereby shall not exceed
$10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations
set forth in this _Section 14.2(c)_ shall not apply to Losses arising from or
related to a Partys breach of any covenant in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement to the extent providing for performance by such Party at
or after the Effective Time.

(d) _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any and all Losses under this
_Article 14_ shall be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by an
Indemnitee or any of such Indemnitees Affiliates under or pursuant to
any insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement
arrangement or contract pursuant to which or under which such Indemnitee or
such Indemnitees Affiliates is a party or has rights (collectively, "
_Alternative Arrangements_ "). An Indemnifying Party shall have no liability,
and an Indemnitee shall have no right to assert any claims, with respect to
any  



 

42  Losses that would have been covered by an Alternative Arrangement unless
such Indemnitee has used reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under
such Alternative Arrangement.

(e) _Indemnitee Knowledge_. No claims by any Indemnitee shall be so asserted
for any breach of a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement if
such Indemnitee had knowledge of such breach at the date of this Agreement or
otherwise at the time of Closing. For all purposes of this Agreement, no
knowledge of any Buyer Indemnitee shall be imputed to any Seller Indemnitee
and no knowledge of any Seller Indemnitee shall be imputed to any Buyer
Indemnitee. For purposes of this _Section 14.2(e)_ knowledge by a Seller
Indemnitee of a breach by Buyer shall be determined to exist if there was
Sellers Knowledge of such breach and knowledge by a Buyer Indemnitee of a
breach by Seller shall be determined to exist if there was Buyers Knowledge
of such breach at the occurrence thereof. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees
that, prior to the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, they shall
review the representations and warranties in this Agreement with the
individuals named in the definition of Sellers Knowledge and Buyers
Knowledge, respectively.

(f) _Mitigation of Losses_. Each Indemnitee agrees that in the event of any
breach giving rise to an indemnification obligation under this _Article 14_ ,
such Indemnitee shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take, or
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party if so requested by the Indemnifying
Party, in order to take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences
of the related breach (including taking steps to prevent any contingent
liability from becoming an actual liability).

(g) _Survival; Claims Period_. All representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date. All covenants contained in this Agreement
that are to be performed prior to the Closing shall terminate at the Closing,
and all covenants contained in this Agreement that are to be performed at or
after the Closing shall survive the Closing indefinitely. NO PARTY SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY FOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS MADE UNDER THIS _ARTICLE 14_ WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT UNLESS A NOTICE OF
SUCH CLAIM IS PROVIDED BY THE INDEMNITEE TO SUCH OTHER PARTY PRIOR TO THE
EXPIRATION OF THE APPLICABLE SURVIVAL PERIOD FOR SUCH REPRESENTATION,
WARRANTY OR COVENANT. If a Claim Notice has been timely given in accordance
with this Agreement prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period
for such representation, warranty or covenant, then the applicable
representation, warranty or covenant shall survive as to such Loss until such
Loss has been finally resolved.

14.3. _Exclusive Remedy; Payment of Indemnity Claims_.

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, IF THE CLOSING OCCURS,
EXCEPT (I) AS PROVIDED IN THIS _ARTICLE 14_ , (II) FOR CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE
OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF, OR (III) IN THE CASE OF FRAUD OR ANY INTENTIONAL
BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT,  



 

43  NO PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY, AND NO PARTY SHALL MAKE ANY CLAIM, FOR
ANY LOSS OR OTHER MATTER (AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT OF
CONTRIBUTION AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES), UNDER,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CERTIFICATE
DELIVERED PURSUANT HERETO), ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT
LIABILITY, OTHER LAWS OR OTHERWISE.

(b) To the extent it is finally determined that Seller is required to provide
an indemnification payment under the terms of this _Article 14_ to a Buyer
Indemnitee, such payment shall be satisfied exclusively by the release of a
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account. 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Losses indemnifiable under this
_Article 14_ shall include any type of damages of the type that _Section
15.17_ provides is not recoverable by any party from and after the Closing.

14.4.  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) Any Indemnitee claiming indemnification under this Agreement with respect
to any claim asserted against the Indemnitee by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that, if true (without any
responsibility for independent investigation of the facts or law contained in
such notice from the third party), would be subject to indemnification under
_Section 14.1_ shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnifying Party of the Third
Party Claim and (ii) deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third
Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnitees request for indemnification
under this Agreement and a copy of all papers served with respect to such
claim (if any). Subject to _Section 14.2(g)_, failure to timely and
completely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the
Indemnitees indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnitee
against such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnitee that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend
such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), by all appropriate
proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 14.4(b)_;  _provided_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party must conduct its defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently in all material respects in order to preserve its
rights to defend the Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the
written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided further, that such consent shall
 



 

44  not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and
unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim of
all Indemnitees affected by the claim, (ii) the settlement agreement does not
contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by any
Indemnitee and (iii) the settlement agreement does not give rise to any
liability of an Indemnitee for which the Indemnifying Party is not liable to
indemnify hereunder. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee
agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, in contesting any Third Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnitee may participate in, but
not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this  _Section 14.4(b)_, and the
Indemnitee shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnitee.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnitee that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnitee pursuant to _Section
14.4(b)_ within 30 days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of a Claim Notice,
then the Indemnitee shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its
reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnitee is actually entitled
to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by the Indemnitee, by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings
shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnitee; provided that, if the
alleged Indemnifying Party denies that it is obligated to indemnify the
alleged Indemnitee for a Third Party Claim pursuant to a Claim Notice, such
alleged Indemnitee shall not have the right to reimbursement for any defense
of such Third Party Claim until the dispute is resolved and the alleged
Indemnifying Party agrees to or is found by the final adjudicating body with
jurisdiction over the dispute to be liable or obligated for the
alleged Indemnitees requested indemnification. In such circumstances, the
Indemnitee shall have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided,
however, that the Indemnitee may not enter into any compromise or settlement
of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder,
without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the
Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section 14.4(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article 14_ , a claim for
indemnification by any Indemnitee for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by delivery of a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party from whom indemnification is sought promptly after such Indemnitee
becomes aware of the facts or circumstances giving rise to such Claim;
provided, that failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect
the Indemnitees rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such delay or omission.



 

45 14.5. _Releases of Indemnity Escrow Funds to Seller_.

(a) Not later than the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _First
Release Date_ "), Buyer and Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent (including by
delivering joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent) to disburse to
Seller from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, an amount equal to the excess of (I)
$5,000,000, _minus_ (II) the sum (without duplication) of (A) the aggregate
amount for which claims for indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees that were
asserted pursuant to this Agreement prior to the First Release Date and are
still pending (or, to the extent finally resolved in favor of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties (or any of them), have not been paid from the Indemnity
Escrow Funds) as of the First Release Date (such aggregate amount, the "
_Interim Claim Amount_ ") and (B) the aggregate amount of all distributions
from the Indemnity Escrow Funds to any Buyer Indemnitee or any designee
thereof prior to the First Release Date. In the event that, after the First
Release Date but prior to the Second Release Date, it is finally determined
in accordance with this Agreement that the Buyer Indemnitees are not entitled
to some portion of the Interim Claim Amount pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer
and Seller shall, within five (5) business days after such final
determination, cause the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent) to disburse to Seller from the Indemnity
