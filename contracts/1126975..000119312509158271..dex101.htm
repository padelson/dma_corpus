to the date of this Agreement and the respective obligations contained in the Credit Facility have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Credit Facility is
in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the parties thereto and no consents, approvals or waivers of any lenders or other Person a party thereto needs to be obtained in order for Buyer to obtain
funds under the Credit Facility. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of any borrowings under the Credit Facility, other than as expressly set forth in the Credit Facility. The available borrowings under the Credit Facility and, if
applicable, the Supplemental Facility, together with other financial resources of Buyer (including cash on hand and marketable securities of Buyer) on the Closing Date, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the timely satisfaction of
Buyer&#146;s obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, (a)&nbsp;no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Buyer under the Credit Facility or any other party to the Credit Facility and (b)&nbsp;subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in <U>Sections 12.1</U> and <U>12.3</U> hereof, Buyer
has no reason to believe that the conditions (if any) to the Financing will not be satisfied. When used herein, the &#147;<B><I>Financing</I></B>&#148; means all borrowings necessary under the Credit Facility and, if applicable, any Supplemental
Facility for Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to perform and pay Buyer&#146;s obligations when required hereunder and thereunder. Buyer has fully paid all fees required to be
