Reorganization (as defined below) and BHI will undertake the BHI
Reorganization (as defined below);

  

  

(ii) Merger Sub will merge with and into BHI, with BHI as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Entity") and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Newco on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of BHI (the "BHI

(as defined below)), will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, be converted into the right to receive one share of Class A
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Newco (the "Class A Common

(iv) Immediately following and as part of a plan that includes the Merger,
Newco will cause the Surviving Entity to be converted into a Delaware limited
liability company ("Newco LLC") by the filing of a Certificate of Formation

Newco's Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class B Common
Stock"), which Membership Interests, together with shares of Class B Common
Stock, will be exchangeable on a 1:1 basis for Class A Common Stock (subject
to adjustment pursuant to the Exchange Agreement) and (C) GE and Newco, as

ARTICLE 2 
  
  
 THE NEWCO REORGANIZATION AND THE GE TRANSFER

  

  

Section 2.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, the Merger will occur, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and BHI shall be the Surviving Entity and a direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Newco. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity
will possess all of the rights, powers and privileges and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities and restrictions of BHI and Merger Sub, all as
provided under the DGCL. At the Effective Time, (A) the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub shall be amended in its entirety to read as set
forth on _Exhibit E_ and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended as provided by
Law and such certificate of incorporation and (B) the bylaws of Merger Sub
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended as
provided by Law, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Entity and
such bylaws. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Entity, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Entity, and the officers of BHI immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Entity, in each case until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until such
officer's earlier death, resignation or removal.

  

  

Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any other action on the part of BHI or any holder of
any capital stock of BHI:

  

  

(i) Except for Appraisal Shares, each share of BHI Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and
cease to exist and will be converted into the right to receive one share of
Class A Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration");

  

  

(ii) All shares of BHI Common Stock that are held by BHI as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and retired and cease
to exist and no Merger Consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor;
and

  

  

 

10  

  

(iii) All shares of issued and outstanding common stock of Merger Sub owned by
Newco shall be automatically converted into shares of common stock of the
Surviving Entity.

  

  

(b) The outstanding shares of common stock of Newco held by BHI immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be repurchased and canceled at the Effective
Time.

  

  

Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

  

  

(a) GE shall appoint the Exchange Agent for the purpose of exchanging the
Merger Consideration for:

  

  

(i) certificates representing shares of BHI Common Stock (the "Certificates")
or

  

  

(ii) uncertificated shares of BHI Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares").

  

  

Promptly after the Closing Date, Newco will send, or will cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of shares of BHI Common Stock at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and instructions that will specify that the
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only on
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent.

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of BHI Common Stock will be entitled to receive, on

  

  

(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or

  

  

(ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares,

  

  

the aggregate Merger Consideration that the holder has a right to receive
under _Section 2.02_. The shares of Class A Common Stock constituting the
Merger Consideration will be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by the holder or is otherwise required under
applicable Law. As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, all shares
of BHI Common Stock will cease to be outstanding and each holder of BHI Common
Stock will cease to have any rights with respect to the BHI Common Stock,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
BHI Common Stock.

  

  

 

11  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it will be a condition to the payment
that:

  

  

(i) either the surrendered Certificate will be properly endorsed or will
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or the applicable Uncertificated
Share will be properly transferred, and

  

  

(ii) the Person requesting the payment will pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that the Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of shares of BHI Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity,
they will be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the BHI Common Stock provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent under _Section 2.03(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares
of BHI Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Closing Date will be returned
to the Surviving Entity, on demand. Any holder who has not exchanged shares of
BHI Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section
2.03_ before that date will look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of
the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect to
the Merger Consideration, in respect of those shares without any interest
thereon. Regardless of the preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity will not
be liable to any holder of shares of BHI Common Stock for any amounts properly
paid to a public official under applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of BHI
Common Stock six (6) years after the Closing Date (or that earlier date,
immediately before the time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) will become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Entity, free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

Section 2.04 _BHI Equity-Based Awards_.

  

  

(a) Each outstanding option to purchase shares of BHI Common Stock granted
under the BHI Stock Plans (a "BHI Option") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease
to represent a right to acquire BHI Common Stock and shall be converted into a
right to acquire Class A Common Stock (a "Newco Option") that shall continue
to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to
such BHI Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, acceleration of vesting in connection with the GE Transfer),
except that such Newco Option shall be with respect to a number of shares of
Class A Common Stock equal to the number of shares of BHI Common Stock subject
to the BHI Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the GE
Transfer and the Dividend, the exercise price per share of each Newco Option
will be reduced by the per share amount of the Dividend; _provided_ that the
Newco Options shall be further adjusted to the extent required to remain
compliant with, or exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A").

  

  

 

12  

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each restricted share of BHI Common Stock (the
"BHI Restricted Stock") granted and then outstanding under the BHI Stock Plans
shall be canceled and converted into, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, a share of Class A Common Stock that shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to such BHI
Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (and, for clarity,
the holders of such shares shall receive the Dividend in accordance with
_Section 7.15_ ). Following and by reason of the GE Transfer, each share of
Class A Common Stock received upon conversion of a share of BHI Restricted
Stock that is, as of the date hereof, subject to terms and conditions
providing for acceleration of vesting in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall be unrestricted.

  

  

(c) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit with respect to BHI
Common Stock that is not a BHI Performance Unit (a "BHI Restricted Stock
Unit") granted and then outstanding that is not, as of the date hereof,
subject to terms and conditions providing for acceleration of vesting in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
canceled and converted into a restricted stock unit with respect to a number
of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of BHI
Common Stock subject to such BHI Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a "Newco Restricted Stock Unit") that shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to
such BHI Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including with respect to rights relating to the Dividend). As of the
Effective Time, each BHI Restricted Stock Unit granted and then outstanding
under the BHI Stock Plans that is, as of the date hereof, subject to terms and
conditions providing for acceleration of vesting in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which by reason of the Merger is
required to be canceled and converted into a Newco Restricted Stock Unit,
shall, by reason of the GE Transfer, be canceled and converted into, as soon
as practicable after the GE Transfer, a number of unrestricted shares of Class
A Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of BHI Common Stock subject
to such BHI Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time
(and, for clarity, the holders of such shares shall receive the Dividend in
accordance with _Section 7.15_ ).

  

  

(d) GE and Newco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ to any holders of BHI Options, BHI
Restricted Stock, BHI Restricted Stock Units or BHI Performance Units
(collectively, "BHI Incentive Awards") such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state,
local or foreign Tax or other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by GE, Newco or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holders of such BHI Incentive Awards, as applicable, in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by GE, Newco or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

  

  

 

13  

  

(e) Pursuant to Section 11.20 of the BHI Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as
amended (the "ESPP"), if the Closing occurs prior to the last day of an
Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP), there shall be no purchases of BHI
Common Stock for that Offering Period, and the ESPP option holders'
accumulated payroll deductions for such Offering Period shall be returned to
the ESPP option holders without interest.

  

  

(f) Prior to the date hereof, BHI has provided GE a true and complete list of
the BHI Incentive Awards outstanding on the date of this Agreement, setting
forth, as applicable, (i) the target number of shares deliverable, on a grant
by grant basis, and the maximum number of shares deliverable, on an aggregate
basis, in respect of BHI Performance Units settled in BHI Common Stock, (ii)
the aggregate target and maximum amounts of cash subject to BHI Performance
Units settled in cash, (iii) the number of shares remaining subject to such
awards on a grant by grant basis, (iv) the dates on which such awards were
granted, (v) the exercise prices applicable to such awards, and (vi) the
settlement date for each BHI Performance Unit, BHI Restricted Stock Unit and
share of BHI Restricted Stock, and the expiration date of each BHI Option.
Promptly following request by GE after the date hereof, BHI will deliver to GE
an updated version of the list provided by BHI to GE.

  

  

(g) Newco shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to have available
for issuance under an effective registration statement filed with the SEC a
sufficient number of shares of Class A Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise, settlement, conversion or vesting of the BHI Incentive Awards with
respect to those individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Closing, will be
subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
where applicable, Newco shall administer any Newco Option, Newco Restricted
Stock Unit, or restricted share of Class A Common Stock issued pursuant to
this _Section 2.04_ in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent the corresponding BHI Incentive Award
complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

  

  

(h) As of the Closing, except as provided in this _Section 2.04_ , all BHI
Stock Plans shall be terminated and all rights under any BHI Incentive Award
and any provision of the BHI Stock Plans providing for the issuance or grant
of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of BHI shall be
canceled. BHI shall ensure that, as of and after the Closing, except as
provided in this _Section 2.04_ , no Person shall have any rights under the
BHI Stock Plans.

  

  

Section 2.05 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of
BHI shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, or any other similar event, but
excluding any change that results from (a) the exercise of stock options or
other equity awards to purchase shares of BHI Common Stock or the settlement
of restricted stock units or deferred stock units or (b) the grant of equity-
based compensation to directors or employees of BHI or under BHI's equity
compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration, amounts payable
under _Section 2.03_ and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement,
as applicable, shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 2.05_ shall not apply to
the Dividend.

  

  

 

14  

  

Section 2.06 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Exchange Agent, BHI, Newco and
Newco LLC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a
holder of BHI Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any applicable
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of BHI Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

  

  

Section 2.07 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Newco, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Newco may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of BHI Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article 2_.

  

  

Section 2.08 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of BHI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.02_ , but instead at the
Effective Time shall become the right to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and at
the Effective Time all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) such
shares of BHI Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal
Shares and (ii) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and
cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Effective Time, each
such Appraisal Share shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. BHI shall deliver prompt notice to
GE of any demands for appraisal of any shares of BHI Common Stock (provided
that the failure of BHI to deliver such prompt notice shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement) and BHI shall provide GE with the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, BHI shall not, without
the prior written consent of GE, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 2.09 _The Conversion_. On the Closing Date, immediately following the
Effective Time and as part of a plan that includes the Merger, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance
with the DGCL and the DLLCA: (i) the Conversion shall be effected pursuant to
which the Surviving Entity shall be converted to a limited liability company
by the filing of a Certificate of Formation and a Certificate of Conversion
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
DGCL and the DLLCA, with Newco as the sole managing member, (ii) Newco, as
sole managing member of Newco LLC, shall adopt, and Newco LLC shall be
governed by, a limited liability company operating agreement (the "Initial
Newco LLC Operating Agreement"), (iii) the officers of the Surviving Entity
shall be the officers of Newco LLC and (iv) the issued and outstanding shares
of the Surviving Entity shall be converted into a number of Membership
Interests in Newco LLC equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
outstanding immediately following the Effective Time.

  

  

 

15  

  

Section 2.10 _The GE Transfer_. On the Closing Date, following the Newco
Reorganization, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DLLCA and the DGCL: (i) GE will receive
in exchange for the GE Transfer Membership Interests representing 62.5% of the
Membership Interests outstanding after giving effect to any issuance of
Membership Interests in connection with such exchange, (ii) GE will contribute
the Class B Stock Purchase Price in cash to Newco in exchange for the issuance
of a number of shares of Class B Common Stock representing 62.5% of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of Newco (calculated on a
fully diluted basis, taking into account all Newco Options, Newco Restricted
Stock Units and any other security, instrument or award that is or will be
outstanding immediately following the Closing and is or will be convertible,
exchangeable or settled into shares of Common Stock of Newco) after giving
effect to such issuance and (iii) Newco and GE, as the members of Newco LLC,
shall adopt, and Newco LLC shall thereafter be governed by, the Newco LLC
Operating Agreement and, immediately following Closing, GE, as a result of (i)
and (ii), shall hold the same number of Units (as defined in the Newco LLC
Operating Agreement) and shares of Class B Common Stock.

  

  

Section 2.11 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable but in no event later than ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, Newco shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
deliver to GE a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, which shall
be prepared and calculated in accordance with the Working Capital Principles
and in the format of the Sample Closing Statement set forth therein, and the
amount by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Minimum Working
Capital or is less than the Minimum Working Capital (such deficiency, if any,
the "Preliminary Adjustment Amount"). To the extent the Closing Working
Capital includes amounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars, such amounts
shall be deemed to have been converted into U.S. dollars for the purpose of
determining the Preliminary Adjustment Amount in accordance with the Working
Capital Principles.

  

  

(b) GE shall complete its review of the Closing Statement within forty-five
(45) days after the date on which it received the Closing Statement. Newco
shall provide to GE and its Representatives such access to the books and
records of any GE OandG Holdco and its Subsidiaries, including such access to
the GE OandG Holdcos' and its Subsidiaries' employees and work papers of their
accountants, as GE shall reasonably request, in connection with GE's review of
the Closing Statement. If GE does not agree with the determination of the
Preliminary Adjustment Amount set forth on the Closing Statement prepared by
Newco, then on or before the last day of such forty-five (45)-day period, GE
shall inform Newco in writing of its objections to the determination of the
Preliminary Adjustment Amount (collectively, the "GE Objections"), setting
forth such objections in reasonable detail and GE's proposed adjustments
thereto. If no GE Objections are received by Newco within such period, then
the Preliminary Adjustment Amount reflected on the Closing Statement shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. Newco shall have thirty (30) days after
the date on which it receives any GE Objections to review and respond to such
GE Objections.

  

  

 

16  

  

(c) If GE and Newco are unable to resolve all of their disagreements as to the
determination of the Preliminary Adjustment Amount set forth in the GE
Objections within fifteen (15) days after the end of Newco's thirty (30) day
review period, then either party may refer any remaining disagreements to BDO
USA, LLP (New York office), or if BDO USA, LLP declines to act, Crowe Horwath
LLP (Chicago office), or if Crowe Horwath LLP declines to act, an
internationally recognized accounting firm, other than KPMG LLP or Deloitte and
Touche LLP, with experience in auditing the financial statements of a company
in the same or similar industry as GE OandG, which is reasonably acceptable to
GE and Newco (and in no case the Boston, Fairfield, Houston or New York office
of the agreed firm) (the "Independent Accountant") which shall determine in
accordance with this _Section 2.11_ , and only with respect to the
disagreements submitted (it being understood that in making such determination
the Independent Accountant shall be functioning as an expert and not an
arbitrator and that the Independent Accountant shall not assign any value with
respect to a disputed matter that is greater than the highest value claimed by
either party or less than the lowest value claimed by either party), whether
and to what extent, if any, the Preliminary Adjustment Amount requires
adjustment. GE and Newco shall jointly engage the Independent Accountant and
enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for such services, including
a customary non-disclosure agreement. The Independent Accountant's
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon GE and Newco and their
Affiliates, absent manifest error. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by GE and Newco. The "Final
Adjustment Amount" shall be equal to the Preliminary Adjustment Amount in the
event that there are no GE Objections in accordance with _Section 2.11(b)_ ,
or shall be as agreed by the parties or finally determined by the Independent
Accountant in accordance with this _Section 2.11(c)_ in the event that there
are GE Objections.

  

  

(d) No amounts shall be paid by any party in the event GE and Newco finally
determine in accordance with this _Section_ _2.11_ that the Closing Working
Capital equals or exceeds the Minimum Working Capital. In the event that the
Final Adjustment Amount reflects Closing Working Capital that is less than the
Minimum Working Capital, GE at its option shall, as an adjustment to the Cash
Transfer (i) pay to Newco LLC an amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount,
such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
U.S. dollars to such account as Newco LLC shall designate in writing to GE no
later than five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Final Adjustment
Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ , or (ii) reduce
the amount of any payable by Newco LLC to GE and included in Closing Working
Capital by an amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount.

  

  

 

17  

  

(e) The Closing Statement, the Preliminary Adjustment Amount and the Final
Adjustment Amount shall be prepared and calculated in good faith and in
accordance with the Working Capital Principles.

ARTICLE 4 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BHI, NEWCO AND MERGERSUB

  

  

Except as set forth in (i) the disclosure letter, delivered by BHI to GE at or
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "BHI Disclosure
Letter") or (ii) the BHI SEC Documents filed with the SEC between December 31,
2014 and the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosure set forth in any
risk factor section or forward looking statements section, the "Specified BHI
SEC Disclosure"), to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that the
disclosure in the Specified BHI SEC Disclosure is responsive to the matters
set forth in this _Article 4_ , BHI, Newco and Merger Sub represent and
warrant to GE as follows:

  

  

Section 4.01 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_.

  

  

(a) BHI and each entity that is a Subsidiary of BHI (the "BHI Subsidiaries")
is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other entity duly
organized and validly existing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has all requisite entity power and authority to own, operate
and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.

  

  

(b) BHI and each of the BHI Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or licensed, as
may be required, and in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character of the property
owned, leased or used by it makes such qualification and/or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and/or licensed does
not constitute a BHI Material Adverse Effect. A "BHI Material Adverse Effect"
means, with respect to BHI, any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
development, change or condition, either individually or together with one or
more other contemporaneously existing facts, circumstances, occurrences,
events, developments, changes or conditions that is, or would reasonably be
expected to be, materially adverse to the business or financial condition of
BHI and the BHI Subsidiaries considered collectively as a single enterprise;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
development, change or condition (or combination thereof) shall not be
considered in determining whether a BHI Material Adverse Effect has occurred
to the extent it results from (A) a change in Law, or GAAP or interpretations
thereof, (B) general economic, market (including the market price of oil and
gas), or political conditions or other conditions (including acts of terrorism
or war or other force majeure events) affecting the industries in which BHI
and its Subsidiaries operate, (C) any change in BHI's stock price, trading
volume or credit rating (unless due to a circumstance which would separately
constitute a BHI Material Adverse Effect), (D) the announcement or pendency of
this Agreement, any actions taken in compliance with this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, (E) acts of God, earthquakes or similar
catastrophes, any weather related event or any outbreak of illness or other
public health event, or (F) the failure of BHI to meet internal or analysts'
expectations, projections or budgets (unless due to a circumstance which would
separately constitute a BHI Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) any fact, circumstance, occurrence, effect, development, change or
condition referred to in clauses (A), (B) or (E) shall be taken into account
for purposes of determining whether a BHI Material Adverse Effect has occurred
to the extent, but only to the extent, such fact, circumstance, occurrence,
effect, development, change or condition adversely affects BHI in a
disproportionate manner as compared to other participants in the industries in
which BHI and its Subsidiaries operate.

  

  

 

19  

  

(c) The copies of the certificate of incorporation of BHI which is
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the BHI 10-K and the bylaws of BHI

(b) As of September 30, 2016, (i) 422,753,256 shares of BHI Common Stock were
outstanding, of which 63,594 were shares of BHI Restricted Stock, and (ii)
477,625 shares of BHI Common Stock were held by BHI in treasury. As of the

shares of BHI Common Stock are reserved for issuance in respect of future
grants under the BHI Stock Plans and (ii) 3,424,745 shares of BHI Common Stock
are reserved for issuance in respect of the ESPP. Since September 30, 2016

authorized or effected any split-up or any other recapitalization of, any of
its capital stock, or directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise

BHI's previously announced share repurchase program). BHI has not heretofore
agreed to take any such action, and there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of BHI of any kind to redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any
outstanding shares of capital stock of BHI. As of September 30, 2016, there
were outstanding BHI Options to purchase an aggregate of 7,820,642 shares of

Restricted Stock Units granted under the BHI Stock Plans, in each case
outstanding on September 30, 2016, and (ii) no BHI Incentive Awards have been
granted under the BHI Stock Plans. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness or warrants or other securities of BHI having the
right to vote (or, other than any outstanding options to purchase BHI Common

vote) on any matters on which stockholders of BHI may vote.

  

  

 

20  

  

(c) All issued and outstanding shares of BHI's capital stock are, and all
shares that may be issued or granted pursuant to the exercise of BHI Options
or options granted under the ESPP, or pursuant to the vesting of BHI
Restricted Stock Unit awards, BHI Performance Unit awards or BHI Restricted
Stock awards granted under the BHI Stock Plans, will be, when issued in
accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. The issuance and sale of all
of the shares of capital stock described in this _Section 4.02_ have been in
material compliance with United States federal and state securities Laws.
Neither BHI nor any of the BHI Subsidiaries has agreed to register any
securities under the Securities Act, or under any state securities Law or
granted registration rights to any individual or entity.

  

  

(d) Except for the BHI Options, options granted under the ESPP, BHI Restricted
Stock Unit awards, BHI Restricted Stock awards and BHI Performance Unit awards
granted under the BHI Stock Plans, as of the date of this Agreement, there are
no outstanding or authorized (i) options, warrants, preemptive rights,
subscriptions, calls or other rights, convertible securities or agreements

Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or

delivery by BHI of this Agreement or the consummation by BHI of the

be filed by BHI with the SEC. As of their respective filing dates, and giving
effect to any amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, the BHI SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the
respective rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to the BHI SEC Documents, and none of the BHI SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date hereof, except for any reports on Form 8-K required
to be filed with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, no event has
occurred with respect to BHI or any of the BHI Subsidiaries which BHI is, or
after the passage of time, will be, required to report by the filing with the

course of business).

  

  

(c) Other than any matters that do not remain the subject of any open or
outstanding inquiry, BHI has not received written notice from the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity that any of its accounting policies or practices are
or may be the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or challenge by
the SEC or other Governmental Entity. Since December 31, 2014, BHI's
independent public accounting firm has not informed BHI that it has any
material questions, challenges or disagreements regarding or pertaining to
BHI's accounting policies or practices which are unresolved as of the date of
this Agreement. Since December 31, 2014, no current officer or director of BHI

matters certified) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-
Oxley Act") and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and
the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete
and correct. Other than any matters that do not remain the subject of any open
or outstanding inquiry, neither BHI nor its officers has received notice from
any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness
or form of such certificates. Neither BHI nor any of its Subsidiaries has
outstanding, nor has arranged or modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, any "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of BHI or any of its
Subsidiaries. "Principal executive officer," "principal financial officer" and
"extensions of credit" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

 

24  

  

(e) BHI has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act);
such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
all information (both financial and non-financial) relating to BHI and the BHI

with or submitted to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to BHI's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of BHI required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. BHI has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the
date of this Agreement, to BHI's auditors and the audit committee of the Board
of Directors of BHI and on Section 4.05(e) of the BHI Disclosure Letter (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect BHI's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in BHI's internal control over financial reporting.

and corporate governance requirements of the NYSE and (ii) all rules,
regulations and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC.

any of the BHI Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or
any director, officer or employee of BHI or any BHI Subsidiary for which BHI
or any BHI Subsidiary may be liable which constitute a BHI Material Adverse
Effect. There are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, awards or orders of any
Governmental Entity outstanding against BHI or any of the BHI Subsidiaries
which constitute a BHI Material Adverse Effect.

Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

  

  

 

25  

  

The portions of the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus supplied by BHI will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation or warranty is
made by BHI with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference

requisite vote of the directors and not subsequently rescinded or modified in
any way, unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the other Transactions are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of BHI and its stockholders,
(ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other
Transactions and (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted for
consideration by the stockholders of BHI and resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of BHI approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (
_provided_ , that any change in or modification or rescission of such
recommendation by the Board of Directors of BHI in accordance with _Section
7.07_ shall not be a breach of the representation in clause (iii) of this
sentence). The Board of Directors of BHI has received from the BHI Financial
Advisor an opinion, dated the date of this Agreement, a written copy of which
will be provided to GE as soon as practicable after the date hereof, solely
for informational purposes, that, as of such date and based upon and subject
to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration
to be received in the Merger by holders of BHI Common Stock (other than GE and
its Affiliates) together with the Dividend is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view.

  

  

(b) The affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding
shares of BHI Common Stock (the "BHI Stockholder Approval") is the only vote
required of the holders of any class or series of BHI capital stock that shall

Merger. None of BHI or its "affiliates" or "associates" or, to the knowledge
of the BHI, any of its stockholders is or has been an "interested stockholder"
(as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) with respect to GE. Prior to the date

material Taxes due or claimed to be due, except for those Taxes being
contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established

disproportionate manner as compared to other participants in the industries in
which the GE OandG Subsidiaries operate.

reasonably customary in comparison to coverage carried by companies in similar
lines of business as GE OandG. Except as would not constitute a GE Material
Adverse Effect none of the GE OandG Subsidiaries is in breach or default under
any such insurance policy, and none of the GE OandG Subsidiaries has taken any
action or failed to take any action which (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a breach or default, or permit a termination or
material modification of any of the material insurance policies of such GE OandG
Subsidiary.

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

Section 7.01 _Preparation of Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Stockholder
's Meeting_.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the delivery by GE to BHI of
the GE OandG Audited Financial Statements in accordance with _Section 7.05(a)_
(and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), BHI shall
cause to be prepared and filed with the SEC the Combined Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form. Each of GE and BHI shall obtain and
furnish the information concerning itself and its Affiliates required to be
included in the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of GE and BHI shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to the Combined
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. Each party shall
promptly notify the other party upon the receipt of any oral or written
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement and shall provide the other party with copies of
all written correspondence and a summary of all oral communications between
it, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to
the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. Each
party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any substantive correspondence (including
responses to SEC comments), amendments or supplements to the Combined Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement prior to filing with the
SEC, and shall provide to the other a copy of all such filings made with the
SEC.

  

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the delivery by GE to BHI of
the GE OandG Audited Financial Statements in accordance with _Section 7.05(a)_
(and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), Newco shall
file with the SEC the Registration Statement containing the Combined Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as necessary to consummate the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Newco shall take any action (other than
filing a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction) required
to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock in the Merger and BHI shall furnish
all information concerning BHI and the holders of shares of BHI Common Stock
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Promptly
after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, BHI and Newco shall
cause the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to BHI's
stockholders, and if necessary, after the definitive Combined Proxy
Statement/Prospectus has been mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemented
or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection therewith, re-
solicit proxies or written consents, as applicable. If at any time prior to
the Closing, the officers and directors of GE or BHI discover any statement
which, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or
misleading with respect to a material fact or omits to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements made in the Combined Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement not misleading, then such party
shall immediately notify the other party of such misstatements or omissions.
BHI shall advise GE and GE shall advise BHI, as applicable, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement becomes
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Class A
Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information.

  

  

 

61  

  

(c) BHI shall, (i) in accordance with BHI's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and applicable Law, take all actions to establish a record date (which
will be as soon as practicable after the date hereof) for, duly call, give
notice of, convene, and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the
"Special Meeting"), for the purpose of securing the BHI Stockholder Approval,
(ii) in accordance with BHI's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
applicable Law, distribute to BHI's stockholders the Combined Proxy
Statement/Prospectus as soon as practicable after the date upon which the
Registration Statement becomes effective and (iii) except as provided in
_Section 7.07_ , use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders
of BHI proxies in favor of the Merger and to take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure the BHI Stockholder Approval. Within forty-five (45)
days following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes
effective, BHI shall convene and hold the Special Meeting. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, BHI's obligations pursuant to the first two
sentences of this _Section 7.01(c)_ shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to BHI of
any Alternative Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board
of Directors of BHI of the BHI Board Recommendation or the Board of Directors
of BHI's approval of this Agreement or the Transactions. Once the Special
Meeting has been called and noticed, BHI shall not postpone or adjourn the
Special Meeting without the consent of GE (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (other than to the extent necessary (i) for
the absence of a quorum, or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board
of Directors of BHI has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by BHI's stockholders prior
to the Special Meeting; _provided_ that in the event that the Special Meeting
is delayed to a date after the Termination Date as a result of either (i) or
(ii) of this sentence, then GE may extend the Termination Date to the fifth
(5th) Business Day after such date). Except to the extent permitted by
_Section 7.07_ , (i) the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall (x) state
that the Board of Directors of BHI has determined that this Agreement and the
Merger are advisable and in the best interests of BHI and (y) include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of BHI that this Agreement be adopted
by the holders of BHI Common Stock (such recommendation described in this
clause (y), the "BHI Board Recommendation") and (ii) neither the Board of
Directors of BHI nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or
publicly propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse
to GE, the BHI Board Recommendation.

  

  

 

62  

  

Section 7.02 _Stock Exchange Listing_.

  

  

Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Class A
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including shares
issuable under any BHI Options) to be approved for listing on the NYSE at or
prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance.

  

  

Section 7.03 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  

  

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, GE shall cause
Newco and its Subsidiaries to provide to each employee of BHI or any BHI
Subsidiary who is employed immediately prior to the Closing and who remains in
the employ of Newco or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing (each such
individual, a "Continuing Employee") (i) a level of base salary or hourly
wages that is no less favorable than the level of base salary or hourly wages
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
cash incentive compensation opportunities (and for employees who are Band V
and above including ungraded employees, equity-based incentive compensation
opportunities) that are no less favorable than the cash and, if applicable,
equity-based incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing ( _provided_ that, in lieu of
equity-based compensation, cash incentive compensation of equivalent value may
be provided) and (iii) with respect to employee benefits, (A) treat similarly
situated Continuing Employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into
account all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, duties,
geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, as other employees
of Newco or its Subsidiaries and (B) not discriminate between employee
benefits provided to Continuing Employees and employee benefits provided to
other employees of Newco or its Subsidiaries, except with respect to
grandfathered employee benefits or as otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, GE shall cause Newco and its Subsidiaries to
honor all BHI Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Closing and
shall cause any employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements
established, maintained or contributed to by Newco and its Subsidiaries that
cover any of the Continuing Employees following the Closing (collectively, the
"Newco Plans") to (i) recognize the pre-Closing service of participating
Continuing Employees with BHI and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting and
eligibility to participate, except to the extent such service credit would
result in a duplication of benefits for the same period, (ii) recognize the
pre-Closing service of participating Continuing Employees with BHI and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of benefit accrual and amounts of benefits and
contributions (other than for benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit
pension plan, an arrangement providing statutory required benefits or, except
as required by a collective bargaining agreement as in effect on the date
hereof or by applicable Law, an arrangement that, under applicable Law or
collective bargaining agreement, is exclusively subject to collective
negotiation or bargaining), except to the extent such service credit would
result in a duplication of benefits for the same period, (iii) waive any pre-
existing condition limitations for participating Continuing Employees and (iv)
provide credit to each participating Continuing Employee under the applicable
Newco Plan for amounts paid by such Continuing Employee prior to the Closing
during the year in which the Closing occurs under any analogous BHI Benefit
Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms of such Newco Plan; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit
the right of BHI or Newco to amend or terminate such plans, arrangements and
agreements in accordance with their terms.

  

  

 

63  

  

(c) GE shall cause Newco and its Subsidiaries to credit under any applicable
Newco Plans each Continuing Employee with all vacation and personal holiday
time that such Continuing Employee has accrued but has not used as of the
Closing, _provided_ that any such credited accruals may be used only during
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.03(b)_ , BHI acknowledges
and agrees that all provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to the
Continuing Employees are included for the sole benefit of BHI, GE and Newco,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person,
including, without limitation, any employees, former employees, any
participant in any BHI Benefit Plan or other benefit plan or arrangement, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with
BHI, GE, Newco, or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any BHI Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plan or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Newco, BHI or any of
their Subsidiaries, to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such BHI
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement following the
Closing in accordance with its terms. In the event that (i) a party other than
the GE, BHI or any of their Subsidiaries makes a claim or takes other action
to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any BHI Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement, and (ii) such provision is
deemed in any judicial proceeding to be an amendment to such BHI Benefit Plan
or other employee benefit plan or arrangement even though not explicitly
designated as such in this Agreement then such provision, to the extent
covered by such deemed amendment, shall lapse retroactively and shall have no
amendatory effect.

  

  

(f) GE shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) communicate or
otherwise meet with any of the employees of BHI and BHI Subsidiaries to
discuss the terms and conditions of employment or employee benefits or
compensation matters without reasonable prior notice to BHI or its designee.
Such communications and/or meetings shall be effectuated solely by human
resources representatives of GE in reasonable cooperation with BHI, and shall
be limited to topics directly related to the terms and conditions of
employment with Newco or one of Newco's Subsidiaries and employee benefits or
compensation matters following the Closing.

  

  

(g) Without limiting _Section 7.03(f)_ , GE and BHI agree that for the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Termination Date, each of GE
and BHI will not, and will ensure that its Affiliates (and any person acting
on behalf of or in concert with it or any of its Affiliates) will not,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any officer, director,
or employee of the other party or any of the other party's Subsidiaries that
(i) was or is involved in the negotiation or implementation of this Agreement
(including members of the integration teams of GE and BHI) or (ii) (A) is an
officer or employee at the Executive Band level or above of GE, or equivalent
of BHI (and shall include employees that are three levels or less down from
the Chief Executive Officer of BHI) and (B) in the case of officers or
employees of GE, is substantially devoted to the GE OandG business. The
restrictions of this _Section 7.03(g)_ shall not prohibit either party,
however, from conducting any general solicitations for employment, such as any
newspaper or Internet help wanted advertisement, directly or through any agent
(including placement and recruiting agencies) that is not directed at such
persons.

  

  

 

64  

  

(h) If, during the twelve (12) month period beginning on the Closing Date, the
employment of any Continuing Employee is terminated as a result of an
Involuntary Termination, (i) Newco LLC shall pay (or shall cause its Affiliate
to pay) such Continuing Employee a lump sum cash severance payment in an
amount equal to the greater of (A) (x) the cash severance payment that would
be payable to such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance plan,
program, agreement or arrangement of BHI or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a
"BHI Severance Arrangement"), if any, that covers such Continuing Employee as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date, under the terms of such BHI
Severance Arrangement as in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing Date
(taking into account service rendered by such Continuing Employee for Newco
and Newco's Affiliates after the Closing Date and disregarding any ability of
BHI or its Subsidiaries to terminate or adversely amend such BHI Severance
Arrangement) or (y) if greater, the amount determined in accordance with the
formula set forth in Annex 7.03(h) of the BHI Disclosure Letter or (B) the
cash severance payable to such Continuing Employee under any severance program
or arrangement of Newco or its Subsidiary and (ii) the vesting of all BHI
Incentive Awards (as converted to Newco equity awards pursuant to _Section
2.04_ ) held by such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date (but excluding
any grants made by Newco after the Closing Date) shall immediately accelerate
in full. Such cash severance amount will be paid on the date that is sixty
(60) days following such Continuing Employee's Separation From Service;
_provided_ that, if such Continuing Employee is a Specified Employee, such
payment shall be made on the date that is six (6) months following such
Continuing Employee's Separation From Service, except to the extent that such
payment may be made prior to such date without incurring additional taxes or
interest under Section 409A.

  

  

For purposes of this _Section 7.03(h)_ , the terms "Separation From Service"
and "Specified Employee" have the meanings ascribed to those terms in Section
409A; the term "Involuntary Termination" shall mean the termination of a
Continuing Employee's employment with Newco or its Subsidiary (without a
contemporaneous transfer of employment to GE or its Affiliate) that occurs
during the twelve (12) month period following the Closing and that results
from either such Continuing Employee's termination of employment by Newco or
its Subsidiary other than for Cause (as defined herein) or a resignation by
such Continuing Employee for Good Reason (as defined herein).

  

  

For purposes of this _Section 7.03(h)_ , the term "Cause" with respect to a
Continuing Employee has the meaning assigned to it (or to a term of like
import) in the applicable BHI Severance Arrangement as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing, or if such applicable BHI Severance
Arrangement that covered such Continuing Employee does not define "Cause" (or
if such Continuing Employee is not covered by a Company Severance Arrangement
as of immediately prior to the Closing) then "Cause" means (i) the willful and
continued failure by the Continuing Employee to substantially perform the
Continuing Employee's duties with Newco (other than any such failure resulting
from the Continuing Employee's incapacity due to physical or mental illness)
or (ii) the willful engaging by the Continuing Employee in conduct which is
demonstrably and materially injurious to Newco or its Affiliate, monetarily or
otherwise.

  

  

 

65  

  

For purposes of this _Section 7.03(h)_ , the term "Good Reason" with respect
to a Continuing Employee has the meaning assigned to it (or to a term of like
import) in the applicable BHI Severance Arrangement as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing, or if such applicable BHI Severance
Arrangement that covered such Continuing Employee does not define "Good
Reason" (or if such Continuing Employee is not covered by a BHI Severance
Arrangement as of immediately prior to the Closing) then "Good Reason" means
(without the Continuing Employee's express written consent) (x) a reduction by
Newco or its Affiliate in the Continuing Employee's annual base compensation
as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to
time, except for across-the-board salary reductions similarly affecting all
individuals having a similar level of authority and responsibility with Newco
or its Affiliate (as applicable), unless such act is corrected prior to the
effective date of the Continuing Employee's termination for Good Reason, or
(y) the relocation of the Continuing Employee's principal place of employment
to a location outside of a 30-mile radius from the Continuing Employee's
principal place of employment immediately prior to the Closing, or Newco or
its Affiliate requiring the Continuing Employee to be based anywhere other
than such principal place of employment (or permitted relocation thereof)
except for required travel on Newco's or its Affiliate's business to an extent
substantially consistent with the Continuing Employee's business travel
obligations immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

The Continuing Employee's continued employment shall not constitute consent
to, or a waiver of any rights with respect to, any act or failure to act
constituting Good Reason hereunder.

  

  

Section 7.04 _Tax Matters_.

  

  

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

  

  

(b) BHI shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Newco
Reorganization to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. BHI will not take (or fail to take) any action which
action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to cause the Newco
Reorganization to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

(c) Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements between GE and any of its
Affiliates (other than the GE OandG Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any GE
OandG Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be terminated prior to the Closing
and neither GE nor such Affiliates nor any GE OandG Subsidiaries shall have any
further liability thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section
7.04(c)_ shall not apply to the Tax Matters Agreement.

  

  

(d) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, BHI shall prepare all Tax
Returns of BHI for any Tax period which are required to be filed on or before
the Closing Date (taking extensions into account) using accounting methods,
principles and positions consistent with those used for prior Tax periods,
unless a change is required by applicable Law or regulation, and all such Tax
Returns shall be timely filed and all related Taxes paid on or before the
Closing Date.

  

  

 

66  

  

(e) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, except as set forth on
Section 7.04(e) of the GE Disclosure Letter, GE shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Tax Returns that (1) solely include one or more GE OandG
Subsidiaries and (2) are not filed or required to be filed with or as part of
any other Tax Return of any consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary or
other Tax group that includes GE or any of its Affiliates (other than a group
that consists solely of one or more GE OandG Holdcos and any of their
Subsidiaries) for any Tax period which are required to be filed on or before
the Closing Date (taking extensions into account) using accounting methods,
principles and positions consistent with those used for prior Tax periods,
unless a change is required by applicable Law or regulation, and all such Tax
Returns shall be timely filed and all related Taxes paid on or before the
Closing Date.

  

  

(f) Between the date of the Transaction Agreement and until the Closing, GE
and BHI shall mitigate, to the extent possible, any Formation Taxes (as
defined in the term sheet for Tax Matters Agreement). Such cooperation shall
include (i) BHI and GE providing any information with respect to Formation
Transactions reasonably requested by the other party and (ii) GE and BHI
jointly determining any Formation Transactions (as defined in the term sheet
for Tax Matters Agreement) to be undertaken by BHI and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that, in the event that GE and BHI disagree on any Formation
Transaction, GE shall make such determination in its reasonable discretion
(for this purpose, any position supported by "substantial authority" under
Treas. Reg. § 1.6662-4(d) (or any similar standard under applicable Law) shall
be considered reasonable). For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.04(f)_
shall apply with respect to the transactions described in the Transactions
Schedule.

  

  

(g) From and after the execution of the Tax Matters Agreement, if there is any
conflict between this Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement with respect to
a matter addressed in the Tax Matters Agreement, to the extent of such
conflict, the Tax Matters Agreement shall prevail and control.

  

  

Section 7.05 _GE O andG Audited Financial Statements_.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following December 31, 2016 (and in
any event no later than April 15, 2017), GE shall deliver to BHI the audited
financial statements of GE OandG required under the Securities Act to be

December 31, 2016 and combined statements of income and cash flows of GE OandG
for the years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016),
prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with all related notes and

combined balance sheets and statements of income for the years ended December

Statements together with the September 30 Audited Financial Statements are the

67  

  

(b) GE shall deliver to BHI not later than three Business Days following the
public filing of the related GE SEC Documents, for the three month period
ending on December 31, 2016 and each three month period thereafter (each, an
"Interim Period") until the Closing Date, an unaudited combined balance sheet
of GE OandG at the end of the applicable Interim Period and unaudited combined
statements of operations of GE OandG for such Interim Period, prepared in
conformity with GAAP, as modified by the Accounting Principles (the "GE

Section 7.06 _Access; Confidentiality_.

  

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing and subject to the requirements of
applicable Laws, BHI shall (i) give to GE and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to the offices, properties, books and
records of BHI and the BHI Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to GE and its
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information as GE
may reasonably request, and (iii) instruct its and the BHI Subsidiaries'
Representatives to cooperate reasonably with GE in its investigation of BHI
and the BHI Subsidiaries, except that nothing herein shall require BHI or any
BHI Subsidiary to disclose any information that would cause a risk of a loss
of privilege to BHI or any BHI Subsidiary. Notwithstanding this _Section 7.06_
, no party nor its Representatives shall have the right to conduct
environmental sampling on any of the properties owned or operated by the other
party or its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section
7.06(a)_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of the business of BHI or the BHI Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Each of GE and BHI acknowledges that the information provided to it and
its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions is
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between GE Oil and Gas UK
Limited and BHI, dated as of May 17, 2016 (as amended or modified from time to
time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"). The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate at the Closing.

  

  

(c) No investigation by and of the parties or their respective Representatives
made pursuant to this _Section 7.06_ shall modify, nullify, amend or otherwise
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.07 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

  

  

(a) Subject to _Section 7.07(b)_ , BHI agrees that from and after the date of
this Agreement, it shall (i) immediately cease and terminate, and cause to be
ceased and terminated, all of its and its Representatives' discussions and
negotiations with any other Person (other than GE or its Affiliates) regarding
any Alternative Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) promptly request, and
cause to be requested that, each Person that has received confidential
information in connection with a possible Alternative Proposal within the last
twelve (12) months return to BHI or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of BHI and the BHI
Subsidiaries and (iii) not grant any waiver or release under or knowingly fail
to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement entered into
or amended during the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof in respect
of a proposed Alternative Proposal unless the Board of Directors of BHI
concludes in good faith that a failure to take any action described in this
clause (iii) would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary obligations to BHI's stockholders under applicable Law.

  

  

 

68  

  

From and after the date of this Agreement, subject to _Section 7.07(b)_ and
_Section 9.03_ , BHI shall not, directly or indirectly, nor shall BHI
authorize or permit any BHI Subsidiary or any of its or their respective
directors, officers, members, employees, representatives, agents, attorneys,
consultants, contractors, accountants, financial advisors and other advisors
(a "Representative") to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information), or engage in
discussions or negotiations regarding, any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the
making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer
(including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its stockholders) which
constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to an Alternative
Proposal, (ii) except for confidentiality agreements entered into pursuant to
the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 7.07(b)_ , or a definitive
agreement entered into or to be entered into concurrently with a termination
of this Agreement by BHI pursuant to _Section 9.03_ , approve or enter into a
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other contract with any
Person, other than GE, for, constituting or otherwise relating to an
Alternative Proposal, (iii) provide or cause to be provided any information or
data relating to BHI or any BHI Subsidiary in connection with, or in response
to, any Alternative Proposal by any Person, or (iv) terminate, amend, waive or
permit the waiver of any voting restriction contained in the organizational or
governing documents of BHI, or take any action contemplated by paragraph
(a)(1) of Section 203 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, BHI acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any officer,
director or financial advisor of BHI takes any action that if taken by BHI
would be a breach of this _Section 7.07_ , the taking of such action by such
officer, director or financial advisor shall be deemed to constitute a breach
of this _Section 7.07_ by BHI.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.07(a)_ , BHI and its
Representatives shall be entitled, prior to obtaining the BHI Stockholder
Approval, to furnish information regarding BHI and any BHI Subsidiary to, or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide, written third party proposal with respect to an
Alternative Proposal that is submitted to BHI by such Person (for so long as
such Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn) if (i) none of BHI, the
Representatives of BHI, the BHI Subsidiaries or the Representatives of the BHI
Subsidiaries shall have breached the provisions set forth in this _Section
7.07_ in any material respect with respect to such Person, and (ii) the Board
of Directors of BHI shall have determined, in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with BHI's financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
(as hereinafter defined); _provided_ that BHI may not enter into negotiations
or discussions or supply any information in connection with an Alternative
Proposal without entering into a confidentiality agreement, which
confidentiality agreement may allow such third party to make Alternative
Proposals to BHI in connection with the negotiations and discussions permitted
by this _Section 7.07(b)_. GE shall be entitled to receive an executed copy of
any such confidentiality agreement and notification of the identity of such
Person promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after BHI's
entering into such discussions or negotiations or furnishing information to
the Person making such Alternative Proposal or its Representatives. BHI shall
promptly provide or make available to GE any non-public information concerning
BHI and any BHI Subsidiary that is provided to the Person making such
Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided
or made available to GE.

  

  

 

69  

  

BHI agrees that it shall notify GE promptly (and in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours of receipt) if any inquiry, contact or proposal related to an
Alternative Proposal is received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, BHI, any BHI Subsidiary, any of its Representatives, or any
Representatives of any BHI Subsidiary, and thereafter shall keep GE informed
in writing, on a reasonably current basis, of all material developments
regarding the status of any such inquiry, contact or proposal and the status
of any such negotiations or discussions. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Board of Directors of BHI from complying with Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from making
any similar disclosure; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure by BHI
that relates to an Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of BHI reaffirms BHI Board
Recommendation in such disclosure.

  

  

(c) Neither the Board of Directors of BHI nor any committee thereof shall (i)
(A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to GE), or propose to
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to GE), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of BHI
or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or approve,
or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve any Alternative Proposal,
(C) fail to include BHI Board Recommendation in the Combined Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Change in Recommendation") or (ii) (A) recommend, adopt or approve, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, or allow BHI or any of the
BHI Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal or that
would require BHI to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 7.07(b)_ ) (an
"Acquisition Agreement") or (B) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if,
prior to obtaining the BHI Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of BHI
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) that the failure to do so would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to BHI's stockholders under applicable
Law, it may (A) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)_ and
cause BHI to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal or (B) make a Change in Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal, but in the case of (1) the foregoing clause (A), only if such
Superior Proposal has not resulted from a breach of its obligations pursuant
to this _Section_ _7.07_ , and (2) the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) only if
(x) BHI provides written notice to GE (a "Notice of Change in Recommendation")
advising GE that the Board of Directors of BHI intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person making Superior Proposal and
copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal that BHI
has received from the Person or its Representatives that made such proposal
and that are the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors of
BHI, including a copy of the proposed Acquisition Agreement (if any) (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change
in Recommendation and compliance with the requirements of this _Section
7.07(c)_ ); (y) during a period of four (4) Business Days following GE's
receipt of a Notice of Change in Recommendation (or, in the event of a new
Notice of Change in Recommendation as a result of any such amendment, an
extension of two (2) additional Business Days), if requested by GE, BHI and
its Representatives shall have negotiated with GE and its Representatives in
good faith to make such revisions or adjustments proposed by GE to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable BHI to proceed with its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and not to make such Change in
Recommendation; and (z) if applicable, at the end of such applicable 4- or
2-Business Day period, the Board of Directors of BHI, after considering in
good faith any such revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that GE, prior to the expiration of such applicable period,
shall have offered in writing in a manner that would form a binding contract
if accepted by BHI, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that the Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to make such Change in
Recommendation would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to BHI's stockholders under applicable Law.

  

  

 

70  

  

(d) Other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, BHI may, at any
time prior to, but not after, obtaining the BHI Stockholder Approval, make a
Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event (an "Intervening
Event Change in Recommendation") if the failure to take such action would
likely be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
BHI to BHI's stockholders under applicable Law, _provided_ , that: (A) GE
shall have received written notice from BHI of BHI's intention to make an
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation at least four (4) Business Days
prior to the taking of such action by BHI, which notice shall specify the
applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) during such period and
prior to making an Intervening Event Change in Recommendation, if requested by
GE, BHI and its Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with GE
and its Representatives regarding any revisions or adjustments proposed by GE
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable BHI to proceed
with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and not make such
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation and (C) BHI may make an Intervening
Event Change in Recommendation only if the Board of Directors of BHI, after
considering in good faith any revisions or adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that GE shall have, prior to the expiration of
the 4-Business Day period, offered in writing in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by BHI, continues to determine in good faith that
failure to make an Intervening Event Change in Recommendation would likely be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to BHI's stockholders under applicable
Law. An "Intervening Event" shall mean any fact, circumstance, occurrence,
event, development, change or condition or combination thereof that (i) was
not known to the Board of Directors of BHI as of the date of this Agreement
(or if known, the consequences or magnitude of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable) and (ii) does not relate to (A) any Alternative
Proposal or (B) clearance of the Merger under the HSR Act, the EC Merger
Regulation or any other Regulatory Law, including any action in connection
therewith taken pursuant to or required to be taken pursuant to _Section 7.08_
; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) any change in the price or trading volume
of BHI Common Stock or of oil or gas shall not be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred (it being
acknowledged, however, that in the case of the price or trading volume of BHI
Common Stock, any underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred); (2) in no
event shall any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or
condition or combination thereof (including any of the foregoing set forth on
or reflected in the GE OandG Audited Financial Statements) that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the business or financial
condition of GE or any of its Subsidiaries constitute an Intervening Event
unless such event, fact, circumstance or development constitutes a GE Material
Adverse Effect; and (3) BHI or GE (in respect of GE OandG) meeting, failing to
meet or exceeding projections shall not be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged,
however, that any underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred).

  

  

 

71  

  

(e) As used in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Alternative Proposal" shall mean any bona fide proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons other than GE or any of its Subsidiaries or any
group of which GE or any of its Subsidiaries is a member (A) for a merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or any similar transaction or
series of transactions involving BHI (or any BHI Subsidiary or BHI
Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of BHI and the BHI Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (B) for
the issuance by BHI of 15% or more of its equity securities or (C) to acquire
in any manner, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of BHI or 15% or more of the aggregate equity
securities of the BHI Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean any Alternative Proposal (A) which
provides that 100% of BHI's outstanding equity securities shall be converted
into, exchanged for or otherwise canceled in exchange for the right to receive
consideration that does not constitute 50% or more of the outstanding equity
securities of the acquiring or surviving entity or its ultimate parent or (B)
providing for the sale of all or substantially all of BHI's assets, in either
case on terms which the Board of Directors of BHI determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with BHI's outside counsel and financial
advisors, would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of BHI Common Stock than the Merger (or
any bona fide written offer or proposal made by GE in response to such
Alternative Proposal or otherwise), taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such Alternative Proposal and this Agreement (including any
conditions to and expected timing of consummation thereof, and all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of such Alternative Proposal and this
Agreement).

  

  

 

72  

  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth in this _Section
7.07_ shall not apply to any action taken by or on behalf of BHI in connection
with its obligations under _Section 7.08_.

  

  

Section 7.08 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Filings, etc._

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
the limitations set forth in _Section 7.08(d)_ , each of the parties hereto
shall, and BHI shall cause each of BHI Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take
promptly, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or to
cause to be done, and to assist and to cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) Subject to _Section 7.08(c)_ and the other terms and conditions herein
provided and without limiting the foregoing, BHI and GE shall (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to):

  

  

(i) make their respective required filings (and filings considered by GE to be
advisable after consulting with, and considering in good faith the views of,
BHI) under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation and any other Regulatory Laws
(and GE shall be responsible for all filing fees incident thereto), which
filings shall be made as promptly as GE deems advisable (after consulting
with, and considering in good faith the views of, BHI), and thereafter shall
make any other required submissions under the HSR Act or other such Laws as
promptly as GE deems advisable (after consulting with, and considering in good
faith the views of, BHI); without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply as
promptly as GE deems advisable with any request for information regarding the
Transactions or any such filings for any Governmental Entity charged with
enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating any Regulatory Law;

  

  

(ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in (A)
determining which filings are required (or considered by GE to be advisable
after consulting with, and considering in good faith the views of, BHI) to be
made prior to the Closing with, and which consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Closing from,
Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions and (B) timely making all
such filings;

  

  

 

73  

  

(iii) promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this
Agreement or the Transactions to that party from any Governmental Entity, it
being understood that correspondence, filings and communications received from
any Governmental Entity shall be immediately provided to the other party upon
receipt, subject in appropriate cases to appropriate confidentiality
agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and consultants;

  

  

(iv) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or substantive
discussion (including any discussion relating to the antitrust merits, any
potential remedies, commitments or undertakings, the timing of any waivers,
consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations, and any agreement
regarding the timing of consummation of the Transactions) with any
Governmental Entity relating to any filings or investigation concerning this
Agreement or the Transactions unless it consults with the other party and its
Representatives in advance and invites the other party's Representatives to
attend, subject in appropriate cases to appropriate confidentiality agreements
to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and consultants, unless the
Governmental Entity prohibits such attendance; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the requirements of this clause (iv) shall not apply to any meeting or
substantive discussion between GE or its Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, to the extent (1) such a meeting
or discussion relates to the sale or disposal of a GE business to the extent
that it is not required by a Governmental Entity as part of a potential
remedy, commitment or undertaking, and (2) GE has sought BHI's consent to a
waiver of the requirements of this clause (iv), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld;

  

  

(v) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with draft copies prior to submission to a Governmental
Entity, with reasonable time and opportunity to comment and consult, of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) that they, their Affiliates or their respective
Representatives intend to submit to any Governmental Entity;

  

  

(vi) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with
their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of
information to any Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, any
filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions of Regulatory Laws; and

  

  

(vii) deliver to the other party's outside counsel complete copies of all
documents furnished to any Governmental Entity as part of any filing, subject
to appropriate confidentiality agreements.

  

  

 

74  

  

(c) GE shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the Transactions
in any investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental
Entity or other person relating to the Transactions or regulatory filings
under applicable Regulatory Law, subject to the provisions of _Section
7.08(a)_ , _Section 7.08(b)_ , _Section 7.08(d)_ and _Section 7.08(e)_ and
_provided_ that GE shall consult with, and consider in good faith the views
of, BHI throughout the antitrust defense of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including by providing BHI with reasonable opportunity to
evaluate, as promptly as practicable, steps to be taken in pursuit of such
defense. BHI shall not make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or
otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Entity
with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy,
or, in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing
or scheduling, except as specifically requested by or agreed with GE. BHI
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide full and effective support of
GE in all material respects in all such investigations, litigation,
negotiations and discussions to the extent requested by GE.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, GE shall take all such action (including
any Antitrust Action) as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any,
that the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice, the European Commission, state antitrust
enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction, may assert under Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any Antitrust Action necessary to
resolve any objection raised by any Governmental Entity in relation to the
businesses set forth on _Annex 7.08_ , or any business of which such business
set forth on _Annex 7.08_ forms a substantial part), and to avoid or
eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and every impediment under
Regulatory Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the Termination Date); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement requires GE or BHI to
take, or cause to be taken, any Antitrust Action with respect to any of the
assets, businesses or product lines of BHI or any of its Subsidiaries, or of
GE or any of its Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Entity or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any combination thereof, if such action would exceed the
Detriment Limit (it being agreed, however, that (i) this proviso shall not be
construed to limit or prevent any Antitrust Action necessary to resolve any
objection raised by any Governmental Entity in relation to the businesses set
forth on _Annex 7.08_ or any business of which such business set forth on
_Annex 7.08_ forms a substantial part and (ii) no Antitrust Action necessary
to resolve any objection raised by any Governmental Entity in relation to the
businesses set forth on _Annex 7.08_ or any business of which such business
set forth on _Annex 7.08_ forms a substantial part shall be subject to, or
taken into account for purposes of calculating, the Detriment Limit). For
purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Action" means any action with respect
to assets, businesses or product lines, including a request that they be (x)
divested or held separate pending divesture or (y) subject to conduct
remedies, limitations or other actions, and the "Detriment Limit" would be
exceeded if the assets, businesses or product lines subject to Antitrust
Action in order to obtain actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations,
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities under Regulatory Laws account for more
than $200,000,000 of revenue for the twelve (12) months ended December 31,
2015. The parties hereto agree that the calculation of revenue for any
overlapping asset, business or product line subject to any Antitrust Action
shall be measured by the lowest such revenue for GE or BHI, as the case may
be, for each overlapping asset, business or product line subject to any
Antitrust Action, regardless of which asset, business or product line GE
actually selects for such Antitrust Action. If requested by GE, BHI will agree
to and take any action contemplated by this _Section 7.08(d)_ , _provided_
that the consummation of any divestiture or the effectiveness of any other
remedy is conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions. The foregoing
agreement in this _Section 7.08(d)_ is made solely to facilitate the closing
of the Transactions and does not constitute a representation or admission that
the Transactions, if consummated without any modification, would violate any
Regulatory Laws or that agreeing to any divestitures, hold separate conditions
or other restrictions permitted herein or suggested by any person or authority
acting under any Regulatory Law would not be harmful to the parties hereto.

  

  

 

75  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the next sentence, GE shall have the right, but not the obligation, to oppose
or refuse to consent to, through litigation or otherwise, any request, attempt
or demand by any Governmental Entity or other person for any divestiture, hold
separate condition or any other restriction with respect to any assets,
businesses or product lines of GE, BHI or any of their respective Subsidiaries
and shall have the obligation to defend any litigation instituted by a
Governmental Entity or other person with respect to the legality of the
Transactions under applicable Regulatory Laws. In the event GE opposes or
refuses to consent to, through litigation or otherwise, including any appeals,
any request, attempt or demand by any Governmental Entity or other person as
provided in the preceding sentence, and (i) such proceedings conclude prior to
the Termination Date with a decree, injunction or order restricting or
prohibiting the Transactions or (ii) no decree, order or injunction has been
issued in such proceedings prior to the Termination Date, then GE shall take
such actions (including Antitrust Actions) in a timely manner, as are
necessary to achieve the clearance by or approval of the Governmental Entity
or other person and satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section
8.01(b)_ (Antitrust/Competition) and _Section 8.01(c)_ (No Injunctions or
Restraints) (with respect to any Regulatory Law) prior to the Termination
Date, _provided_ that GE shall not be required to take any action that would
exceed the Detriment Limit.

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Laws" means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the EC Merger Regulation, and all other federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative

BHI, GE and Newco shall consult with each other prior to issuing, and provide
each other with the opportunity to review and comment upon, any public

that each of BHI and GE may make any public statements in response to
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or analyst or investor conference calls, so long as such

and GE. In addition, BHI shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and
except for any public disclosure under _Section 7.07_ , consult with GE
regarding the form and content of any public disclosure of any material
developments or matters involving BHI, including earnings releases, reasonably
in advance of publication or release. BHI and GE agree to issue a joint press
release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.11 _Efforts; Release of Credit Support; Notification of Certain
Matters_.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions that are necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, to consummate the Transactions, including
using its commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) the obtaining of all material consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any failure to obtain a
consent, approval or waiver from a third party shall not constitute a failure
of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_ or _8.03(b)_ to be
satisfied on the Closing Date); and

  

  

(ii) the obtaining of the unconditional release of GE and its Affiliates
(other than the GE OandG Subsidiaries) from each of the guarantees, letters of
credit, financial assurances, surety bonds, performance bonds or other
contractual obligations in respect of GE OandG (including those securing
obligations in excess of $10,000,000 set forth on Section 7.12(a)(ii) of the
GE Disclosure Letter) and entered into in the ordinary course of business
prior to the Closing (the "Credit Support Instruments"), including effecting
such release through Newco LLC's provision of guarantees or other credit
support or the substitution in all respects of Newco LLC for GE or any
Subsidiary of GE (other than the GE OandG Subsidiaries) that is a party to any
Credit Support Instrument so that Newco LLC or the applicable Subsidiary of
Newco LLC shall be solely responsible for the obligations of such Credit
Support Instruments; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such release or
substitution must be effected pursuant to documentation reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to BHI and GE. In the event GE identifies,
after the date hereof, guarantees or other credit support instruments relating
to GE OandG to which GE or one of its Affiliates (other than the GE OandG
Subsidiaries) is a party (the "Additional Credit Support"), GE shall notify
BHI in writing of the existence and terms of such Additional Credit Support,
and BHI, upon receipt of such notice, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly cause the release and
substitution of such Additional Credit Support in a manner consistent with the
foregoing; _provided_ , _further_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any
failure to obtain a release of a Credit Support Instrument shall not
constitute a failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_
or _Section 8.03(b)_ to be satisfied on the Closing Date. All costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the release or substitution of the Credit
Support Instruments and the Additional Credit Support, as the case may be,
shall be borne by Newco LLC. From and after the Closing, Newco LLC shall
indemnify GE for any and all Damages arising from or relating to the Credit
Support Instruments and the Additional Credit Support to the extent resulting
from a breach of the underlying obligation by Newco. In the event that GE or
any of its Affiliates (other than the GE OandG Subsidiaries) remains a party to
any Credit Support Instruments or Additional Credit Support following the
Closing, Newco LLC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish
the foregoing release and substitution in accordance with this _Section
7.11(a)(ii)_.

  

  

 

77  

  

(b) BHI agrees to give prompt notice to GE, and to use commercially reasonable
efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, the occurrence or failure to occur, or
the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause the failure
of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ ; _provided_ , _however_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.11(b)_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice. GE agrees to give prompt notice to BHI, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, the occurrence
or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably
likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.03_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 7.11(b)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

Section 7.12 _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

  

(a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers and employees of BHI and the BHI Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Persons") as provided in the organizational and governing
documents of BHI and the BHI Subsidiaries or under indemnification agreements
between Indemnified Persons and BHI and the BHI Subsidiaries, in each case as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing (the "Indemnification Obligations") shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect as obligations of the
Surviving Entity for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing
unless otherwise required by Law, _provided_ that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made during such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. Newco LLC shall
guarantee the full performance of the Indemnification Obligations by the
Surviving Entity.

  

  

(b) BHI may prior to Closing obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance
policies for the Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the
Closing Date, are covered by BHI's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,
that in no event shall BHI expend an amount pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_
in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by BHI for its existing
coverage in the aggregate set forth on Section 7.13(b) of the BHI Disclosure
Letter.

  

  

 

78  

  

If for any reason BHI does not obtain and fully pay for such "tail" insurance
policies prior to the Closing, Newco or Newco LLC shall maintain director and
officer liability insurance policies from a reputable and financially sound
carrier through and including the date six (6) years after the Closing with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior
to or at the Closing (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby) and such policies shall contain
coverage that is at least as favorable to the Persons covered by such existing
policies (a complete and accurate copy of which has been made available to
Newco); _provided_ , that in no event shall Newco or Newco LLC be required to
expend an amount pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_ in excess of 300% of the
current annual premium paid by BHI for its existing coverage in the aggregate
and if such comparable coverage cannot be obtained by paying an aggregate
premium equal to or below 300% of the current annual premium, the Surviving
Entity shall only be required to maintain as much coverage as can be
maintained by paying an aggregate premium equal to 300% of such amount.

  

  

(c) This _Section 7.12_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person
(notwithstanding that such Persons are not parties to this Agreement) and
their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided
for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. If Newco or Newco LLC or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Newco or Newco
LLC, as the case may be, shall assume the applicable obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.12_.

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to BHI
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents or fiduciaries under any BHI Benefit Plan, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.12_ is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies.

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

79  

  

Section 7.13 _Integration Planning_. After the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date, GE and BHI shall establish a mechanism, subject to applicable
Law, reasonably acceptable to both parties by which the parties will confer on
a regular and continued basis regarding the general status of the ongoing
operations of BHI and the BHI Subsidiaries and GE OandG and reasonably necessary
integration planning matters and communicate and consult with specific persons
to be identified by each party to the other with respect to the foregoing. In
furtherance of the foregoing, BHI and GE shall reasonably cooperate with each
other to the extent reasonably required in connection with any Tax matters
relating to post-Closing integration planning (including by the provision of
reasonably relevant records or information and using commercially reasonable
efforts to make available relevant third party advisors).

  

  

Section 7.14 _Entity Formations and Reorganizations_.

will not undertake any activity except for any activity specifically required
by this Agreement or otherwise specifically required to consummate the Newco
Reorganization.

  

  

(b) _Merger Sub_. BHI shall cause Newco to cause Merger Sub to take any action

except for any activity specifically required by this Agreement or otherwise
specifically required to consummate the Merger.

  

  

(c) _BHI Reorganization_. Prior to the Closing, BHI shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, undertake certain restructuring transactions (the "BHI
Reorganization") as described in the Transactions Schedule. In connection with
the BHI Reorganization, BHI shall, and shall cause the counterparties thereto
to enter into the Long-Term Ancillary Agreements, in each case effective at
the Closing.

  

  

(d) _GE Reorganization_. Prior to the Closing, GE shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, undertake certain restructuring transactions (the "GE
Reorganization") as described on the Transactions Schedule, which (a) shall
include (i) the transfer of the assets of GE and its Affiliates related to GE
OandG to the GE OandG Subsidiaries, as described on _Annex 7.14(d)(i)_ , and (ii)
the assumption by the GE OandG Subsidiaries of the Assumed Liabilities (as
described on _Annex 7.14(d)(ii)_ ) and (b) shall be pursuant to documentation
that BHI has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon (which
comments, if any, shall be reasonably considered by GE). In connection with
the GE Reorganization, GE shall, and shall cause the counterparties thereto
to, enter into the Long-Term Ancillary Agreements, in each case effective at
the Closing.

with respect to Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each officer or director who is or will be subject to the

under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(c) the condition set forth in _Section 8.03(e)(ii)_ is not satisfied upon the
delivery to BHI of the Comparable GE OandG Audited Financial Statements, and BHI

(20) Business Days of such delivery.

  

  

Section 9.04 _Termination by GE_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing by GE if:

  

  

(a) BHI shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.02(b)_ , and (ii) is incapable of
being satisfied or cured by BHI prior to the Termination Date or, if capable
of being satisfied or cured, is not satisfied or cured by BHI within thirty
(30) calendar days following receipt of written notice from GE of such breach
or failure to perform ("BHI Terminable Breach"); _provided_ that GE is not
then in GE Terminable Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement by GE contained in this Agreement;

  

  

 

86  

  

(b) a Change in Recommendation (whether in respect of a Superior Proposal or
an Intervening Event) has occurred; or

  

  

(c) BHI shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
of its obligations under _Section 7.07(a)_.

  

  

Section 9.05 _Effect of Termination_.

  

  

(a) In the event that:

  

  

(i) (A) an Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or publicly
disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at least ten (10) days prior to, the
Special Meeting, (B) this Agreement is terminated by BHI or GE pursuant to
_Section 9.02(c)_ , and (C) within twelve (12) months after the date this
Agreement is terminated, BHI enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to, or consummates, any Alternative Proposal;

  

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by GE pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_ , or by
GE or BHI pursuant to _Section 9.02(c)_ if at the time of such termination
pursuant to _Section 9.02(c)_ GE would also have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_ ;

  

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by BHI or GE pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_
with respect to Regulatory Laws;

  

  

(iv) (w) this Agreement is terminated (A) by BHI pursuant to _Section 9.03_
due to GE's material breach of _Section 7.08_ , which breach results in the
condition set forth in _Article 8_ being incapable of being satisfied, or (B)
by BHI or GE pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ and as of the Termination Date, (x)
one or more of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ or _Section 8.01(c)_
has not been satisfied (including, without limitation, as a result of GE not
agreeing to take or not taking any Antitrust Action in excess of the Detriment
Limit) and (y) all of the other conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and
_Section 8.02_ have been satisfied (other than any such conditions which by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date but subject to such
conditions being capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date
of termination) _provided_ that for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ have been satisfied, the definition
of "BHI Material Adverse Effect" shall be interpreted without taking into
account any effect resulting from any Regulatory Law applicable to the
Transactions or prohibition under or in respect of any Regulatory Law
applicable to the Transactions;

  

  

(v) this Agreement is terminated (A) by BHI pursuant to _Section 9.03(c)_ or
(B) by BHI or GE pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ if at the time of such
termination pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ the condition set forth in _Section
8.03(e)(i)_ or _(ii)_ has not yet been satisfied;

  

  

 

87  

  

then (1) in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this _Section 9.05(a)_
, BHI shall pay to GE a termination fee of $750,000,000 in cash (the "BHI
Termination Fee"), less the aggregate amount of any of GE's Expenses
previously reimbursed pursuant to the next paragraph, it being understood that
in no event shall BHI be required to pay BHI Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, and (2) in any such event under clause (iii) or (iv) of this
_Section 9.05(a)_ GE shall pay to BHI a termination fee of $1,300,000,000 in
cash (the "GE Termination Fee"), it being understood that in no event shall GE
be required to (x) pay the GE Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (y)
pay the GE Expense Reimbursement Amount if the GE Termination Fee is also
payable.

  

  

In the event that an Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or
publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at least ten (10) days prior
to, the Special Meeting and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by BHI or
GE pursuant to _Section 9.02(c)_ and no BHI Termination Fee is yet payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence, then BHI shall pay to GE
all of the Expenses of GE up to an aggregate amount of $40 million.

  

  

In the event that the Agreement is terminated in the circumstances
contemplated by _Section 9.05(a)(v)_ , (the "GE Expense Reinbursement Amount")
GE shall pay to BHI all of the Expenses of BHI up to an aggregate amount of
$40 million.

  

  

As used herein, "Expenses" shall mean, with respect to GE or BHI, all
reasonable out-of-pocket documented fees and expenses (including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and
investment bankers of GE and its Affiliates or BHI and its Affiliates, as the
case may be) incurred by such party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution, financing
and performance of this Agreement and all other matters related to the
Transactions.

  

  

For purposes of this _Section 9.05_ , the term " _Alternative Proposal_ "
shall have the meaning set forth in _Section 7.07(e)(i)_ , except that all
references to "15%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

  

  

(b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of _Section
9.05(a)_ shall be made to GE promptly following the earlier of the execution
of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, any
transaction contemplated by the Alternative Proposal (and in any event not
later than three (3) Business Days after delivery to BHI of notice of demand
for payment; any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of
_Section 9.05(a)_ shall be made to GE promptly following termination of this
Agreement by GE pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_ (and in any event not later than
three (3) Business Days after delivery to BHI of notice of demand for
payment); and in each case such payment shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account details of GE provided in writing
by GE to BHI for such purposes. Any payment required to be made pursuant to
clause (iii) of _Section 9.05(a)_ shall be made to BHI promptly following
termination of this Agreement by BHI pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_ (and in any
event not later than three (3) Business Days after delivery to GE of notice of
demand for payment) and shall be made to BHI concurrently with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by GE
pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_ ; any payment required to be made pursuant to
clause (iv) of _Section 9.05(a)_ shall be made to BHI promptly following
termination of this Agreement by BHI pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ or _Section
9.03(a)_ (and in any event not later than three (3) Business Days after
delivery to GE of notice of demand for payment) and shall be made to BHI
currently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of
this Agreement by GE pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ ; and, in each case, such
payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account details of BHI provided in writing by BHI to GE for such purposes. In
circumstances where this _Section 9.05_ requires a reimbursement of Expenses,
BHI shall reimburse GE for such Expenses on the later of (i) the day that is
three (3) Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement and
(ii) the day that is three (3) Business Days after the delivery of
documentation of such Expenses, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account details of BHI provided in writing by BHI to GE for such
purposes or the account details of GE provided in writing by GE to BHI for
such purposes, as applicable.

  

  

 

88  

  

(c) In the event that BHI or GE, as the case may be, shall fail to pay BHI
Termination Fee or the GE Termination Fee, as applicable, and/or Expenses
required pursuant to this _Section 9.05_ when due, such fee and/or Expenses,
as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the
date such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate
equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A., in the City of New York from time to time during such period, as such
bank's Prime Lending Rate. In addition, if either party shall fail to pay such
fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, when due, such party shall also pay
to the other party all of such other party's costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or
Expenses, as the case may be.

  

  

(d) GE and BHI acknowledge that the fees, Expense reimbursement and the other
provisions of this _Section 9.05_ are an integral part of this Agreement and
the Transactions and that, without these agreements, GE and BHI would not
enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that none
of the BHI Termination Fee or the GE Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather
a reasonable amount that will compensate GE, or BHI, as the case may be, for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree
that in circumstances where payment of the BHI Termination Fee or the GE
Termination Fee is required hereunder, upon such payment, the payment of any
such BHI Termination Fee or GE Termination Fee in accordance with this
_Section 9.05_ , shall be the exclusive remedy of GE or BHI, as the case may
be, for (i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions
to be consummated and (ii) any other losses, damages, obligations or
liabilities suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the
Transactions. Upon payment of the BHI Termination Fee or the GE Termination
Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.05_ , none of BHI or GE or any of their
respective stockholders, partners, members, directors, Affiliates, officers or
agents, as the case may be, shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

  

(e) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Sections 9.01_ through
_9.04_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and, except as
set forth in this _Section 9.05_ , there shall be no liability or obligation
on the part of GE, BHI or their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
_provided_ that (i) _Sections 4.10_ , _5.09_ , _7.03(b)_ , _7.03(g)_ , _9.05_
and _10.06_ will survive termination hereof and (ii) subject to _Section
9.05(d)_ , no party shall be relieved from any liabilities or damages (which
the parties acknowledge and agree may include, in addition to reimbursement of
expenses and out-of-pocket costs, and to the extent proven, other damages
suffered by the other party calculated based on loss suffered by such other
party's stockholders (taking into consideration all relevant matters and
equitable considerations), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages
of such other party and not of such other party's stockholders themselves and
may only be pursued by such other party through actions expressly approved by
its board of directors) as a result of any willful and material breach by any
party of any of such party's representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 9.05(e)_
, "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach that is a
consequence of an act or a failure to take such act by the breaching party
with the knowledge that the taking of such act (or the failure to take such
act) would cause a material breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 10.01 _Indemnification by GE_. From and after the Closing Date, GE
will indemnify and defend Newco and its Subsidiaries (including Newco LLC) and
their respective successors and assigns (the "BHI Indemnified Persons") from
and against any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any BHI Indemnified
Person arising out of, in connection with or relating to all Liabilities of GE
and its Affiliates other than the Assumed Liabilities but including the
Excluded Liabilities.

  

  

Section 10.02 _Indemnification by Newco LLC_. From and after the Closing Date,
Newco LLC will indemnify and defend GE and its Subsidiaries and their
respective successors and assigns (the "GE Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any GE Indemnified Person
arising out of, in connection with or relating to:

  

  

(a) all Assumed Liabilities; and

  

  

(b) any Liability arising out of or relating to (i) the operation of GE OandG
prior to the Closing or (ii) Newco or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing.

  

  

Section 10.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

  

(a) In the case of any claim, action, arbitration, hearing, legal complaint,
investigation, litigation or suit (whether civil, criminal, administrative)
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, any Governmental Entity
or arbitrator (a "Proceeding") with respect to which GE or Newco, as the case
may be (the "Indemnifying Party"), is obligated under _Article 10_ to
indemnify any BHI Indemnified Person or GE Indemnified Party (as the case may
be, the "Indemnified Party"), the Indemnified Party will give prompt written
notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any Proceeding
asserted by any third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party
may assume the defense of such Third Party Claim by employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party no later than thirty (30)
days after the date of the notice. The Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party
Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. The Indemnified
Party's delay or failure to notify timely the Indemnifying Party will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article 10_ ,
except to the extent the delay has an adverse impact on the Indemnifying
Party's ability to defend against the Damages. If the Indemnifying Party does
assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may, if it so desires, employ
counsel at its own expense. In addition, where the named parties to a
Proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party and an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, where the Indemnified Party has been advised by
counsel that there are conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party which make representation by the same counsel not
appropriate. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third
party may be asserted by notice to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
preclude the Indemnified Party from any indemnification which it may claim in
accordance with this _Article 10_.

  

  

 

90  

  

Section 10.04 _Limitation of Liability_. No party will be liable to any other
party for Damages under this _Article 10_ that are special, indirect,
incidental, exemplary, consequential or punitive damages, or loss of profits,
except where the damages or loss of profits are claimed by or awarded to a
third party in a Third Party Claim. The amount of any Damages shall be net of
(i) any recovery or benefit (including insurance and indemnification) payable
to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with the facts
giving rise to the right of indemnification and, if the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates receives such recovery or benefit after receipt of
payment from the Indemnifying Party, then the amount of such recovery or
benefit, net of reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery or
benefit, shall be paid to the Indemnifying Party and (ii) any Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Damages (determined on a with and without basis).

  

  

Section 10.05 _Exclusion of Other Remedies_. From and after the Closing Date,
the indemnification obligations set forth in this _Article 10_ will constitute
the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for any Damages based on,
arising out of or otherwise in respect of any matter addressed in _Article 10_
, except for remedies involving specific performance or other equitable
relief.

  

  

Section 10.06 _Taxes_. From and after the date hereof, GE will indemnify and
defend the BHI Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by any BHI Indemnified Person arising out of, in
connection with or relating to any Formation Taxes (as defined in the term
sheet for the Tax Matters Agreement); _provided_ that (i) such indemnity shall
only apply to the extent that the Closing does not occur (and, to the extent
the Closing occurs, the Tax Matters Agreement shall exclusively govern
Formation Taxes), (ii) GE shall not be required to indemnify the BHI
Indemnified Persons to the extent the Damages arise out of, are in connection
with, or relate to a breach of _Section 7.04(f)_ by a BHI Indemnified Person
and (iii) Damages for this purpose shall be reduced by Tax benefits actually
realized by any BHI Indemnified Person that result from Formation
Transactions; _provided_ , that to the extent any such Formation Transactions
(as defined in the term sheet for Tax Matters Agreement) would be reflected on
the same Tax Return as the Formation Transaction the gains and income of which
otherwise would constitute Damages, any such Tax benefit shall be treated as
actually realized to the extent such Tax benefit offsets (in amount and
character) such gains or income (for this purpose, by solely taking into
account such Formation Transactions). Except as provided by this _Section
10.06_ , the Tax Matters Agreement shall exclusively govern any
indemnification for Taxes, and the provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement
(and not those of this _Article 10_ ), shall govern the manner in which
matters relating to Taxes are conducted and resolved and liabilities for Taxes
are allocated, paid and indemnified against.

Section 11.04 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance_.

  

  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT
OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION
OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Chancery
Court") or, if, but only if, the Chancery Court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware with respect
to any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it
will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the courts of the State of Delaware, as described above,
and (iv) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Nothing in this _Section 11.04_ shall prevent any party from bringing
an action or proceeding in any jurisdiction to enforce any judgment of the
Chancery Court or any federal court located in the State of Delaware, as
applicable. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section 11.01_ shall be effective service of process
for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

94  

  

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that,
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party
shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it
whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to (i) a decree or order
of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. In circumstances where the parties are obligated to
consummate the Transactions and the Transactions have not been consummated
(other than as a result of the other party's refusal to close in violation of
this Agreement) each of the parties expressly acknowledges and agrees that the
other party and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that
monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party and its
stockholders, and that such other party on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically the breaching party's
obligation to consummate the Transactions.

  

  

Section 11.05 _Counterparts; Electronic Transmission of Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of electronic
mail transmission or otherwise, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

  

Section 11.06 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  

  

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties

contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it

inclusion of any item in the BHI Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty of BHI in this Agreement or the GE Disclosure
Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty of GE in this Agreement
shall not be deemed to be an admission that such item is a material exception,

materiality qualification.

subsection (a) above and the deemed Capital Contribution by Newco to the

Common Unit registered in the name of Newco for each share of Class A Common
Stock issued by Newco under the Incentive Plan;

subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and is not transferable for
purposes of Code Section 83, and if a valid election under Code Section 83(b)
has not been made with respect to such share of Class A Common Stock, the
foregoing transactions shall be deemed to occur for U.S. federal income tax

purchase the same percentage of the total outstanding shares of Newco common
stock it held immediately prior to such issuance by Newco under _Section
3.03(d)_. The Company shall give written notice of any such proposed issuance
of additional Common Units to Newco under _Section 3.03(d)_ no less than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date of the proposed issuance (or, if later,
as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to such proposed
issuance), which notice shall include the number of additional Common Units
proposed to be issued to Newco and the proposed date of issuance; _provided_
that no such notice shall be required for any individual issuance of fewer
than 100,000 additional Common Units so long as the sum of all such individual
issuances below such amount do not exceed 1,000,000 Common Units in the
aggregate in any ninety (90) day period referred to in the following proviso;
_provided_ , _further_ , the Company shall provide at least one such notice
every ninety (90) days, which notice shall include all previous issuances of
Common Units to Newco under _Section 3.03(d)_ during such ninety (90) day
period for which a notice has not previously been provided pursuant to this
sentence. GE shall have the right to purchase a number of Common Units and an
equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock, in each case as would result
in GE holding immediately following such purchase the same percentage of the
total outstanding Common Units and shares of Newco Common Stock it held
immediately prior to such issuance by Newco under _Section 3.03(d)_ , by
delivering written notice to the Company and Newco within one hundred twenty
(120) days following the end of the year in which such issuance occurs. The
aggregate purchase price payable by GE for each such Common Unit and share of
Class B Common Stock shall be equal to (i) in the case of a Common Unit issued
by the Company in respect of a restricted share award under the Incentive
Plans, the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the NYSE (or any
successor exchange on which the Class A Common Stock may be listed) ("
_Closing Price_ ") on the date of the issuance of such restricted share award
(or, if later, the date of issuance of Common Units to GE),

  

  

 

13  

  

and (ii) in the case of a Common Unit issued by the Company in respect of an
option exercise (or the exercise of any other instrument that entitles the
holder thereof to purchase a share of Class A Common Stock) under the
Incentive Plans, the Closing Price on the date such option or other instrument
is exercised (or, if later, the date of issuance of Common Units to GE), and
GE shall pay an amount equal to the par value per share of Class B Common
Stock to Newco in respect of each such share of Class B Common Stock so
purchased and pay the balance to the Company in respect of each such Common
Unit so purchased. GE's rights under this _Section 3.05(a)_ shall accrue in
arrears and shall be exercisable by GE at any time, and from time to time, at,
from and after the issuance by the Company of additional Common Units to Newco
provided for in _Section 3.03(d)_ (but subject to the limitations set forth
herein).

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time
GE is permitted to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock under the
Stockholders Agreement (" _Permitted Acquisition_ "), GE may instead, at its
election purchase Paired Interests (and the Company shall be obligated to
issue the Common Units forming a part of such Paired Interests to GE) on the
following terms and conditions:

  

(i) In the case of a Permitted Acquisition of Class A Common Stock from Newco,
the aggregate purchase price shall be equal to the per share price of the
Class A Common Stock that would have been paid to Newco by GE multiplied by
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that would have been acquired by
GE, in each case but for such election.

  

(ii) In the case of a Permitted Acquisition of Class A Common Stock from any
Person other than Newco, GE shall give Newco notice of its election under this
Section 3.05(b)(ii) specifying the number of Paired Interests it desires to
acquire (which number shall not be greater than the number of shares of Class
A Common Stock it would otherwise be permitted to acquire). Within five
Business Days after its receipt of such notice, subject to applicable law,
Newco shall repurchase a number of shares of Class A Common Stock in the
market equal to the number of Paired Interests GE desires to acquire. The
aggregate purchase price payable by GE for the Paired Interests shall be the
price paid by Newco for the shares of Class A Common Stock so repurchased.
Concurrently with Newco's repurchase of such shares of Class A Common Stock,
the Company shall repurchase the same number of Common Units from Newco for
the same aggregate purchase price.

  

(iii) The aggregate purchase price payable by GE under this Section _3.05(b)_
shall be paid by GE to Newco and the Company in a manner consistent with
_Section 3.05(a)_.

  

(iv) GE shall indemnify Newco for any Taxes incurred by Newco or the Company
resulting from or arising out of an acquisition by GE of Class B Common Stock
and Common Units pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 3.05(b)_ ,
_provided_ that any such Taxes indemnified against shall be treated as
Formation Taxes (as defined in and for purposes of the term sheet for the Tax
Matters Agreement, as defined in the Transaction Agreement).

  

  

 

14  

  

Section 3.06 _Authorization and Issuance of Additional Uni_ _ts_.

  

The Company shall only be permitted to issue additional Units or other Equity
Securities in the Company to the Members and on the terms and conditions
provided for in _Section 3.02_ , _Section 3.03_ , _Section 3.0_ 4, _Section
3.05_ and this _Section 3.06_. Subject to the foregoing, the Managing Member
may cause the Company to issue additional Common Units authorized under this
Agreement at such times and upon such terms as the Managing Member shall
determine and the Managing Member shall amend this Agreement as necessary in
connection with the issuance of additional Common Units and admission of
additional Members under this _Section 3.06_ without the requirement of any
consent or acknowledgement of any other Member.

  

Section 3.07 _Certificates Representing Units; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates; Registration and Transfer of Units_.

  

(a) Units shall not be certificated unless otherwise determined by the
Managing Member. If the Managing Member determines that one or more Units
shall be certificated, each such certificate shall be signed by or in the name
of the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer and any other Officer
designated by the Managing Member, representing the number of Units held by
such holder. Such certificate shall be in such form (and shall contain such
legends) as the Managing Member may determine. Any or all of such signatures
on any certificate representing one or more Units may be a facsimile, engraved
or printed, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The Managing Member
agrees that it shall not elect to treat any Unit as a "security" within the
meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code unless thereafter all
Units then outstanding are represented by one or more certificates.

  

(b) If Units are certificated, the Managing Member may direct that a new
certificate representing one or more Units be issued in place of any
certificate theretofore issued by the Company alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon delivery to the Managing Member of an affidavit of
the owner or owners of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The
Managing Member may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to give the Company a bond
sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or
the issuance of any such new certificate.

  

(c) Upon surrender to the Company or the transfer agent of the Company, if
any, of a certificate for one or more Units, duly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, in
compliance with the provisions hereof, the Company shall issue a new
certificate representing one or more Units to the Person entitled thereto,
cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, the Managing Member may prescribe such
additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the
issue, Transfer and registration of Units.

  

  

 

15  

  

Section 3.08 _Negative Capital Accounts_. No Member shall be required to pay
to any other Member or the Company any deficit or negative balance which may
exist from time to time in such Member's Capital Account (including upon and
after dissolution of the Company).

  

Section 3.09 _No Withdrawal_. No Person shall be entitled to withdraw any part
of such Person's Capital Contribution or Capital Account or to receive any
Distribution from the Company, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

  

Section 3.10 _Loans From Members_. Loans by Members to the Company shall not
be considered Capital Contributions. Subject to the provisions of _Section
3.01_ , the amount of any such loans shall be a debt of the Company to such
Member and shall be payable or collectible in accordance with the terms and
conditions upon which such loans are made.

  

Section 3.11 _Repurchase or Redemption of Newco Equity Securities_. If at any
time any shares of Equity Securities of Newco that are not Class B Common
Stock are repurchased or redeemed (whether by exercise of a put or call,
automatically or by means of any other arrangement) by Newco for cash, then
the Managing Member shall cause the Company, immediately after such repurchase
or redemption, to repurchase or redeem a corresponding number of Common Units
held by Newco (in the case of a repurchase or redemption of Class A Common
Stock) or a corresponding number of the class or series of Units that are
substantially equivalent to the class or series of Equity Securities of Newco
repurchased or redeemed (in the case of a repurchase or redemption of any
other Equity Securities of Newco), at an aggregate repurchase or redemption
price equal to the aggregate repurchase or redemption price of the shares of
the Equity Securities of Newco being repurchased or redeemed (plus any
expenses related thereto) and upon such other terms as are the same for the
Equity Securities of Newco being repurchased or redeemed. The Company shall
indemnify Newco for any Taxes incurred by Newco resulting from or arising out
of an acquisition by the Company of Common Units pursuant to this _Section
3.11_.

  

ARTICLE IV 
  
 DISTRIBUTIONS

  

Section 4.01 _Distributions_.

  

(a) Distributions. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and hereunder,
Distributions to Members in respect of any class or series of Units may be
declared by the Managing Member out of funds or property legally available
therefor in such amounts and on such terms (including the payment dates of
such Distributions) as the Managing Member shall determine using such record
date as the Managing Member may designate, and any such Distributions shall be
made to the Members that hold such class or series of Units as of the close of
business on such record date on a pro rata basis in accordance with each
Member's Percentage Interest with respect to such class or series of Units as
of the close of business on such record date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Managing Member shall have the obligation to make Distributions as set
forth in _Sections 4.01(b)_ and _13.02_ ; and _provided_ _further_ that,
notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no Distributions
shall be made to any Member to the extent such Distribution would render the
Company insolvent. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, insolvency means
the inability of the Company to meet its payment obligations when due.

  

  

 

16  

  

Promptly following the designation of a record date and the declaration of a
Distribution pursuant to this _Section 4.01(a)_ , the Managing Member shall
give notice to each Member of the record date, the amount and the terms of the
Distribution and the payment date thereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, it
is intended that the Managing Member shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and hereunder, have the right in its sole discretion to make
Distributions to the Members pursuant to this _Section 4.01(a)_ in such
amounts as shall enable Newco to pay dividends or to meet its obligations,
including its obligations pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement (to the extent
such obligations are not otherwise able to be satisfied as a result of Tax
Distributions required to be made pursuant to _Section 4.01(b)_ ).

  

(b) Tax Distributions.

  

(i) On or about each date (a " _Tax Distribution Date_ ") that is five (5)
Business Days prior to each due date for a tax return of Newco, as determined
without regard to extensions, or other date on which Newco is required to
satisfy a tax liability (including as a result of any audit or other
proceeding or pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement), the Company shall be
required to (x) make a Distribution to Newco such that Newco receives the
amount required to enable Newco to meet its tax obligations, including its
obligations pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, due on such date (a "
_Newco Tax Distribution_ ") and (y) make a Distribution to each other Member
so that the Distributions made to Newco under clause (i) and the Distributions
made to each other Member under this clause (ii) are in accordance with the
Members' respective Percentage Interests on the applicable Tax Distribution
Date (a " _Member Tax Distribution_ " and, together with Newco Tax
Distributions, " _Tax Distributions_ ").

  

(ii) If, on a Tax Distribution Date, there are insufficient funds on hand to
distribute to the Members the full amount of the Tax Distributions to which
such Members are otherwise entitled, Newco Tax Distributions shall be made in
full (to the extent of available funds) and Member Tax Distributions shall be
made to the Members to the extent of available funds remaining after such
Newco Tax Distributions in accordance with the Members' Percentage Interests
and the Company shall make future Distributions to the Members as soon as
funds become available in a manner such that each Member has received the same
aggregate Tax Distributions such Member would have received if there had been
sufficient funds available on the applicable Tax Distribution Date to make the
full amount of Tax Distributions required to have been made under _Section
4.01(b)(i)_ on such Tax Distribution Date.

  

(iii) The amount of any Tax Distribution to a Member pursuant to this _Section
4.01(b)_ shall be treated as having been made pursuant to _Section 4.01(a)_
and shall reduce the amounts that otherwise would be distributed to the
Members pursuant to _Section 4.01(a)_.

  

Section 4.02 _Restricted Distributions_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make any
Distribution to any Member on account of any Company Interest if such
Distribution would violate any applicable Law.

ARTICLE V 
  
  
 CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; ALLOCATIONS; TAX MATTERS

  

Section 5.01 _Capital Accounts_.

  

(a) A separate capital account (" _Capital Account_ ") shall be maintained for
each Member in accordance with Section 704(b) of the Code, and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder including Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). The Capital Account of each Member as of the date hereof
shall be the dollar value set forth opposite the Member's name on the Schedule
of Members.

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.01(a)_ , the Capital Account for
each Member shall consist of the Member's initial Capital Contribution (actual
or deemed), increased by any additional Capital Contributions made by the
Member, by the Member's share of all items of Net Income allocated pursuant to
_Section 5.02_ and any items in the nature of income or gain which are
specially allocated pursuant to _Section 5.03_ and by the amount of any
Company liabilities which the Member is deemed to assume or which are secured
by any Company property distributed to the Member, and decreased by the
Member's share of all items of Net Loss allocated pursuant to _Section 5.02_
and any items in the nature of loss or deduction which are specifically
allocated pursuant to _Section 5.03_ , by any Distributions to the Member and
by the amount of any liabilities of the Member which the Company is deemed to
assume or which are secured by property contributed by the Member to the
Company. A transferee of a Member's Interest in the Company (or a portion
thereof) shall succeed to the Capital Account of such Member (or the pro rata
or other appropriate portion thereof, as applicable).

  

(c) No interest shall be paid on the initial Capital Contributions or on any
subsequent Capital Contributions. No amount distributed pursuant to _Section
4.01_ of this Agreement shall constitute a payment under Code Section 707(a)
or Section 707(c).

  

Section 5.02 _Allocations_.1 Subject to the other provisions of this _Article
V_ , Net Income, Net Loss, and, to the extent necessary, individual items of
income (including gross income), gain, loss or deduction of the Company, for
each Fiscal Period shall be allocated among the Members so that the Capital
Account of each Member, after making such allocation, is, or is as nearly as
possible, equal (or in proportion thereto, if the total amount to be allocated
is insufficient) to the Distributions that would be made to such Member if the
Company were dissolved, its affairs wound up, and its assets other than money
sold for cash equal to their respective Gross Asset Values (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not be booked up or written down to fair market
value for this purpose outside of an actual liquidation), all Company
liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability
to the Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such liability), and the net
assets of the Company (if any) were distributed to the Members in accordance
with _Section 13.02_ immediately after making such allocation. For purposes
of, and prior to, making allocations under this _Section 5.02_ , (x) Capital
Accounts shall be reduced by any Distributions made with respect to the Fiscal
Period, (y) Capital Accounts shall be adjusted for any special allocations
required pursuant to _Section 5.03_ with respect to the Fiscal Period, and (z)
each Member's Capital Account balance shall be deemed to be increased by such
Member's share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain.

   1 NTD: Section 5.02 to be coordinated with the provisions of the Tax Matters
Agreement.

  

  

 

18  

 

  

Section 5.03 _Regulatory Allocations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in _Section 4.01_ , the following special allocations will apply.

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f),
notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article V_ , if there is a net
decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Period, each Member shall
be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Period
(and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Periods) in an amount that equals such
Member's share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain, determined in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant
to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Member pursuant to such sentence. The items
to be allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This _Section 5.03(a)_ is intended
to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4), notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article V_ , if
there is a net decrease in Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable
to a Member Nonrecourse Debt during any Fiscal Period, each Member that has a
share of the Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to such Member
Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain
for such Fiscal Period (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Periods) in an
amount that equals such Member's share of the net decrease in Member
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain that is attributable to such Member Nonrecourse
Debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in
proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Member
pursuant to such sentence. The items to be allocated shall be determined in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2).
This _Section 5.03(b)_ is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback
requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

  

(c) In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2, any Nonrecourse
Deductions for any Fiscal Period shall be specially allocated among the
Members in accordance with the Members' respective Percentage Interests.

  

(d) Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Period shall be specially
allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to
the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse Deductions are
attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(1).

  

(e) If any Member unexpectedly received any adjustments, allocations, or
distributions described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) items of Company income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate the deficit balance in such Member's Adjusted Capital Account
Balance created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as promptly
as possible; _provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this _Section 5.03(e)_
shall be made only to the extent that a Member would have a deficit Adjusted
Capital Account Balance in excess of such sum after all other allocations
provided for in this _Article V_ have been tentatively made as if this
_Section 5.03(e)_ were not in this Agreement. This _Section 5.03(e)_ is
intended to comply with the "qualified income offset" requirement of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

  

  

 

19  

  

(f) If any Member has a deficit Capital Account at the end of any Fiscal
Period which is in excess of the sum of (i) the amount such Member is
obligated to restore, if any, pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, and
(ii) the amount such Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to
the penultimate sentences of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(1) and
1.704-2(i)(5), each such Member shall be specially allocated items of Company
income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible;
_provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this _Section 5.03(f)_ shall be made
only if and to the extent that a Member would have a deficit Capital Account
in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this
_Article V_ have been tentatively made as if _Section 5.03(e)_ and this
_Section 5.03(f)_ were not in this Agreement.

  

(g) The allocations set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_ - _(f)_ , inclusive (the "
_Regulatory Allocations_ "), are intended to comply with certain requirements
of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2. It is the intent of
the Members that, to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be
offset either with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of
other items of Company income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this
_Section 5.03_. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section 5.03_ (other than the Regulatory Allocations) to the contrary, the
Managing Member shall make such offsetting special allocations of income,
gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that,
after such offsetting allocations are made, each Member's Capital Account
balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such
Member would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part of the
Agreement and all Company items were allocated pursuant to the general
allocation provisions.

  

(h) The Company shall make an election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code
effective for the Company taxable year that includes the date hereof and all
future taxable years. Pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of
any Company asset under Code Section 734(b) or 743(b) is required to be taken
into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to
the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment
increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
basis), and such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Members in a
manner that is consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are
required to be adjusted pursuant to such Treasury Regulations.

  

Section 5.04 _Tax Allocations_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.04(b)_ , as of the end of each
Fiscal Period, items of Company income, gain, loss, deduction, and expense
shall be allocated for federal, state, and local income tax purposes among the
Members in the same manner as the income, gain, loss, deduction, and expense
of which such items are components were allocated to Capital Accounts pursuant
to this _Article V_.

  

  

 

20  

  

(b) In accordance with Code Sections 704(b) and 704(c) and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, Company income, gains, deductions, and
losses with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Company
shall be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation
between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company for federal income
tax purposes and its fair market value at that time (to be computed in
accordance with Treasury Regulations). If Company property is revalued in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) at any time,
subsequent allocations of Company income, gains, deductions and losses with
respect to such property's revaluation and its adjusted basis for federal
income tax purposes in the same manner as the variation is taken into
consideration under Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.2

  

Section 5.05 _Indemnification and Reimbursement for Payments on Behalf of a
Member_. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to pay any
amount to a Governmental Entity (or otherwise makes a payment to a
Governmental Entity) that is specifically attributable to a Member or a
Member's status as such (including federal withholding taxes, state personal
property taxes and state unincorporated business taxes, but excluding payments
such as professional association fees and the like made voluntarily by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on behalf of any Member based upon such
Member's status as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries),
then such Member shall indemnify the Company or its Subsidiary in full for the
entire amount paid (including interest, penalties and related expenses). The
Managing Member may offset Distributions to which a Member is otherwise
entitled under this Agreement against such Member's obligation to indemnify
the Company or its Subsidiary under this _Section 5.05_. A Member's obligation
to make contributions to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under this
_Section 5.05_ shall survive the termination, dissolution, liquidation and
winding up of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and for purposes of this
_Section 5.05_ , the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be treated as
continuing in existence. Each Member hereby agrees to furnish to the Company
or its Subsidiaries such information and forms as required or reasonably
requested in order to comply with any laws and regulations governing
withholding of tax or in order to claim any reduced rate of, or exemption
from, withholding to which the Member is legally entitled.

_Managing Member_ ") and (ii) the Managing Member shall conduct, direct and
exercise full control over all activities of the Company.

   2 NTD: Section 5.04 to be coordinated with the provisions of the Tax Matters
Agreement.

 

  

 

21  

  

The Managing Member shall be the "Manager" of the Company for the purposes of
the DLLCA. Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein and subject to
the other provisions of this Agreement, the Members hereby consent to the
exercise by the Managing Member of all such powers and rights conferred on the
Members by the DLLCA with respect to the management and control of the
Company. Any vacancies in the position of Managing Member shall be filled in
accordance with _Section 6.04_.

  

(b) The day-to-day business and operations of the Company shall be overseen
and implemented by officers of the Company (each, an " _Officer_ " and
collectively, the " _Officers_ "), subject to the limitations imposed by the
Managing Member. An Officer may, but need not, be a Member. Each Officer shall
be appointed by the Managing Member and shall hold office until his or her
successor shall be duly designated and shall qualify or until his or her death
or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner
hereinafter provided. Any one Person may hold more than one office. Subject to
the other provisions in this Agreement (including in _Section 6.07_ below),
the salaries or other compensation, if any, of the Officers of the Company
shall be fixed from time to time by the Managing Member. The authority and
responsibility of the Officers shall include such duties as the Managing
Member may, from time to time, delegate to them and the carrying out of the
Company's business and affairs on a day-to-day basis. The initial officers of
the Company shall be those persons appointed and designated by the Managing
Member on the date hereof. All Officers shall be, and shall be deemed to be,

or the merger, consolidation, reorganization or other combination of the
Company with or into another entity.

  

Section 6.02 _Actions of the Managing Member_. The Managing Member may act
through any Officer or through any other Person or Persons to whom authority
and duties have been delegated pursuant to _Section 6.07_.

  

Section 6.03 _Resignation; No Removal_. The Managing Member may resign at any
time by giving written notice to the Members. Unless otherwise specified in
the notice, the resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the
Members, and the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make
it effective. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members (other than Newco) have
no right under this Agreement to remove or replace the Managing Member.

  

Section 6.04 _Vacancies_. Vacancies in the position of Managing Member
occurring for any reason shall be filled by Newco (or, if Newco has ceased to
exist without any successor or assign, then by the holders of a majority in
interest of the voting capital stock of Newco immediately prior to such
cessation). For the avoidance of doubt, the Members (other than Newco) have no
right under this Agreement to fill any vacancy in the position of Managing
Member.

  

  

 

22  

  

Section 6.05 _Transactions Between the Company, the Managing Member and
Affiliates_. The Managing Member may cause the Company to contract and deal
with any Subsidiary of the Company on such terms as the Managing Member, the
Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall determine. Subject to Section
4.5 of the Stockholders Agreement, the Managing Member may cause the Company
to contract and deal with any Affiliate of the Managing Member which is not a
Subsidiary of the Company, _provided_ such contracts and dealings are on arm's
length terms and are in the best interests of the Company.

  

Section 6.06 _Reimbursement for Expenses_. The Managing Member shall not be
compensated for its services as Managing Member of the Company except as
expressly provided in this Agreement. The Members acknowledge and agree that,
upon the effective time of the Merger (as defined in the Transaction
Agreement), the Managing Member's Class A Common Stock will be publicly traded
and therefore the Managing Member will have access to the public capital
markets and that such status and the services performed by the Managing Member
will inure to the benefit of the Company and all Members; therefore, the
Managing Member shall be reimbursed by the Company for any expenses incurred
on behalf of the Company, including all fees, expenses and costs of Newco
being a public company (including public reporting obligations, proxy
statements, stockholder meetings, stock exchange fees, transfer agent fees,
SEC and FINRA filing fees and offering expenses) and maintaining its corporate
existence. To the extent practicable, expenses incurred by the Managing Member
on behalf of or for the benefit of the Company shall be billed directly to and
paid by the Company and, if and to the extent any reimbursements to the
Managing Member by the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ constitute
gross income to such Person (as opposed to the repayment of advances made by
the Managing Member on behalf of the Company), such amounts shall be treated
as "guaranteed payments" within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code and
shall not be treated as Distributions for purposes of computing the Members'
Capital Accounts.

  

Section 6.07 _Delegation of Authority_. The Managing Member (a) may, from time
to time, delegate to one or more Persons such authority and duties as the
Managing Member may deem advisable, and (b) may assign titles (including chief
executive officer, president, chief executive officer, chief financial
officers, chief operating officer, vice president, secretary, assistant
secretary, treasurer or assistant treasurer) and delegate certain authority
and duties to such Persons as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented
and/or otherwise modified from time to time. Any number of titles may be held
by the same individual. The salaries or other compensation, if any, of such
agents of the Company shall be fixed from time to time by the Managing Member,
subject to the other provisions in this Agreement.

  

Section 6.08 _Limitation of Liability of Managing Member_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in an agreement entered into by
such Person and the Company, neither the Managing Member nor any of the
Managing Member's Affiliates shall be liable to the Company or to any Member
that is not the Managing Member for any act or omission performed or omitted
by the Managing Member in its capacity as the sole managing member of the
Company pursuant to authority granted to the Managing Member by this Agreement
or the DLLCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise provided
herein, such limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent the act or
omission was attributable to the Managing Member's gross negligence, willful
misconduct or knowing violation of Law or for any present or future breaches
of any representations, warranties or covenants by the Managing Member or its
Affiliates contained herein or in the other agreements with the Company.

  

  

 

23  

  

The Managing Member may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this
Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either
directly or by or through its agents, and shall not be responsible for any
misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent (so long as such agent
was selected in good faith and with reasonable care). The Managing Member
shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts, including financial advisors, and any act of or
failure to act by the Managing Member in good faith reliance on such advice
shall in no event subject the Managing Member to liability to the Company or
any Member that is not the Managing Member.

  

(b) Whenever in this Agreement the Managing Member is permitted or required to
take any action or to make a decision in its "sole discretion" or
"discretion," or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the Managing
Member shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires,
including its own interests, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any
interest of or factors affecting the Company or other Members ( _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.08(b)_ shall
limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties under the
Stockholders Agreement).

  

(c) Whenever in this Agreement the Managing Member is permitted or required to
take any action or to make a decision in its "good faith" or under another
express standard, the Managing Member shall act under such express standard
and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall not be subject to any
other or different standards imposed by this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated herein, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, so long as the Managing Member acts in good faith, the resolution,
action or terms so made, taken or provided by the Managing Member shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or impose liability upon the Managing
Member or any of the Managing Member's Affiliates ( _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.08(c)_ shall limit or otherwise
affect the obligations of the parties under the Stockholders Agreement).

  

Section 6.09 _Investment Company Act_. The Members shall use their respective
best efforts to ensure that the Company shall not be subject to registration
as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act.

  

Section 6.10 _Outside Activities of the Managing Member_. The Managing Member
shall not, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any business or
operations, other than in connection with (a) the ownership, acquisition and
disposition of Common Units, (b) the management of the business and affairs of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (c) the operation of the Managing Member as
a reporting company with a class (or classes) of securities registered under
Section 12 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and listed on a
securities exchange, (d) the offering, sale, syndication, private placement or
public offering of stock, bonds, securities or other interests, (e) financing
or refinancing of any type related to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
assets or activities,

  

  

 

24  

  

and (f) such activities as are incidental to the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as otherwise provided herein, the net proceeds of any
financing raised by the Managing Member pursuant to the preceding clauses (d)
and (e) shall be made available to the Company, whether as Capital
Contributions, loans or otherwise, as appropriate, and, _provided_ _further_ ,
that the Managing Member may, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time
to time hold or acquire assets in its own name or otherwise other than through
the Company and its Subsidiaries so long as the Managing Member takes
commercially reasonable measures to ensure that the economic benefits and
burdens of such assets are otherwise vested in the Company or its
Subsidiaries, through assignment, mortgage loan or otherwise or, if it is not
commercially reasonable to vest such economic interests in the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, the Members shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
Agreement to reflect such activities and the direct ownership of assets by the
Managing Member. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit the
Managing Member from executing any guarantee of indebtedness of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

  

Section 6.11 _Corporate Opportunities_.

  

(a) In recognition and anticipation (i) that the Company will not be a wholly-
owned subsidiary of GE and that GE will be a significant stockholder of the
Company, (ii) that directors, officers and/or employees of GE may serve as
directors, managers and/or officers of the Company, (iii) that, subject to any
contractual arrangements that may otherwise from time to time be agreed to
between GE, the Company and/or Newco, including the Stockholders Agreement, GE
may engage in the same, similar or related lines of business as those in which
the Company, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other business
activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the Company,
directly or indirectly, may engage, (iv) that GE may have an interest in the
same areas of corporate opportunity as the Company and Affiliated Companies
thereof, and (v) that, as a consequence of the foregoing, it is in the best
interests of the Company, that the respective rights and duties of the
Company, and of GE, and the duties of any directors, managers and/or officers
of the Company who are also directors, officers and/or employees of GE be
determined and delineated in respect of any transactions between, or
opportunities that may be suitable for both, the Company and Affiliated
Companies thereof, on the one hand, and GE, on the other hand, the sections of
this _Section 6.11_ shall to the fullest extent permitted by Law regulate and
define the conduct of certain of the business and affairs of the Company in
relation to GE and the conduct of certain affairs of the Company as they may
involve GE and its directors, officers and/or employees, and the powers,
rights, duties and liabilities of the Company and its officers, directors,
managers and unitholders in connection therewith. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any Units, or
any interest therein, shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented
to the provisions of this _Section 6.11_.

  

(b) Newco has entered into the Stockholders Agreement with GE, and, subject to
the Stockholders Agreement, the Company may from time to time enter into and
perform, and cause or permit any Affiliated Company of the Company to enter
into and perform, one or more agreements (or modifications or supplements to
pre-existing agreements) with GE pursuant to which the Company or an
Affiliated Company thereof, on the one hand, and GE, on the other hand, agree
to engage in transactions of any kind or nature with each other and/or agree
to compete, or to refrain from competing or to limit or restrict their
competition, with each other, including to allocate and to cause their
respective directors, managers, officers and/or employees (including any who
are directors, managers, officers and/or employees of both) to allocate
opportunities between or to refer opportunities to each other.

  

  

 

25  

  

Subject to _Section 6.11(d)_ , and except as otherwise agreed in writing
(including in the Stockholders Agreement), no such agreement, or the
performance thereof by the Company or any Affiliated Company thereof, or GE,
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be considered contrary to (i)
any fiduciary duty that GE may owe to the Company or any Affiliated Company
thereof or to any Member or other owner of an equity interest in the Company
or an Affiliated Company thereof by reason of GE being a controlling or
significant equityholder of the Company of any Affiliated Company thereof or
participating in the control of the Company or of any Affiliated Company
thereof or (ii) any fiduciary duty owed by any director, manager and/or
officer of the Company or any Affiliated Company thereof who is also a
director, manager, officer and/or employee of GE to the Company or such
Affiliated Company, or to any equityholder thereof. Subject to _Section
6.11(d)_ , to the fullest extent permitted by Law, GE, as a Member of the
Company or as an equityholder of any Affiliated Company thereof, or as a
participant in control of the Company or any Affiliated Company thereof, shall
not have or be under any fiduciary duty to refrain from entering into any
agreement or participating in any transaction referred to above, and no
manager and/or officer of the Company who is also a director, officer and/or
employee of GE shall have or be under any fiduciary duty to the Company or any
Affiliated Company thereof to refrain from acting on behalf of the Company or
any Affiliated Company thereof or of GE in respect of any such agreement or
transaction or performing any such agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

(c) Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the Company and GE,
including in the Stockholders Agreement, and subject to _Section 6.11(d)_ , GE
shall to the fullest extent permitted by Law have no duty to refrain from (i)
engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as the Company
or (ii) doing business with any client, customer or vendor of the Company, and
(except as provided in _Section 6.11(d)_ ) neither GE nor any officer,
director and/or employee thereof shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, be deemed to have breached its fiduciary duties, if any, to the Company
solely by reason of GE's engaging in any such activity. Except as otherwise
agreed in writing between the Company and GE, in the event that GE acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate
opportunity for both the Company and GE, GE shall to the fullest extent
permitted by Law have fully satisfied and fulfilled its fiduciary duty with
respect to such corporate opportunity, and the Company to the fullest extent
permitted by Law renounces any interest or expectancy in such business
opportunity and waives any claim that such business opportunity constituted a
corporate opportunity that should have been presented to the Company or any
Affiliated Company thereof, if GE acts in a manner consistent with the
following policy: if GE acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or
matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Company and GE, such
corporate opportunity shall belong to GE unless such opportunity was expressly
offered to GE in its capacity as a Member of the Company. In the case of any
corporate opportunity in which the Company has renounced its interest and
expectancy in the previous sentence, GE shall to the fullest extent permitted
by Law not be liable to the Company or its Members for breach of any fiduciary
duty as a stockholder of the Company by reason of the fact that GE acquires or
seeks such corporate opportunity for itself, directs such corporate
opportunity to another Person, or otherwise does not communicate information
regarding such corporate opportunity to the Company.

  

  

 

26  

  

(d) For purposes of this _Section 6.11_ , (1) " _Affiliated Company_ " in
respect of the Company shall mean any entity controlled by the Company, (2)
"corporate opportunities" shall include, but not be limited to, business
opportunities that the Company is financially able to undertake, which are,
from their nature, in the line of the Company's business, are of practical
advantage to it and are ones in which the Company, but for _Section 6.11(c)_ ,
would have an interest or a reasonable expectancy, and in which, by embracing
the opportunities, the self-interest of GE or its directors, officers and/or
employees will be brought into conflict with that of the Company, and (3) "
_GE_ " shall mean GE and its Affiliates (other than the Managing Member, the
Company and any entity that is controlled by the Managing Member or the
Company).

  

(e) The Managing Member will conduct the operations of the Managing Member and
its Subsidiaries through the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries.

  

ARTICLE VII 
  
 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

  

Section 7.01 _Limitation of Liability and Duties of Members_.

  

(a) Except as provided in this Agreement or in the DLLCA, no Member (including
the Managing Member) shall be obligated personally for any debts, obligation
or liability solely by reason of being a Member or acting as the Managing
Member of the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the failure of the Company to observe any formalities or
requirements relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its
business and affairs under this Agreement or the DLLCA shall not be grounds
for imposing personal liability on the Members for liabilities of the Company.

  

(b) In accordance with the DLLCA and the laws of the State of Delaware, a
Member may, under certain circumstances, be required to return amounts
previously distributed to such Member. To the extent that a Member may be
obligated under the DLLCA or other Delaware law to return to or for the
benefit of the Company any Distribution made by the Company to or for the
benefit of such Member, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, such
obligation shall be deemed to be compromised within the meaning of Section
18-502(b) of the DLLCA so that, except as required by Law, the Members to whom
money or property is distributed shall not be obligated to return such money
or property to the Company or any other Person. However, if any court of
competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Agreement, any Member is obligated to make any such payment, such obligation
shall be the obligation of such Member and not of any other Member.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (subject to _Section
6.08_ with respect to the Managing Member), to the extent that, at law or in
equity, any Member (or any Member's Affiliate or any Managing Member, managing
member, general partner, director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary or
trustee of any Member or of any Affiliate of a Member) has duties (including
fiduciary duties) to the Company, to the Managing Member, to another Member,
to any Person who acquires an interest in a Company Interest or to any other
Person bound by this Agreement, all such duties (including fiduciary duties)
are hereby eliminated, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and replaced
with the duties or standards expressly set forth herein, if any.

  

  

 

27  

  

The elimination of duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, the
Managing Member, each of the Members, each other Person who acquires an
interest in a Company Interest and each other Person bound by this Agreement
and replacement thereof with the duties or standards expressly set forth
herein, if any, are approved by the Company, the Managing Member, each of the
Members, each other Person who acquires an interest in a Company Interest and
each other Person bound by this Agreement.

  

Section 7.02 _Lack of Authority_. No Member, other than the Managing Member or
a duly appointed Officer, in each case in its capacity as such, has the
authority or power to act for or on behalf of the Company, to do any act that
would be binding on the Company or to make any expenditure on behalf of the
Company. The Members hereby consent to the exercise by the Managing Member and
the Officers of the powers conferred on them by Law and this Agreement.

  

Section 7.03 _No Right of Partition_. No Member, other than the Managing
Member, shall have the right to seek or obtain partition by court decree or
operation of Law of any Company property, or the right to own or use
particular or individual assets of the Company.

  

Section 7.04 _Indemnification_.

  

(a) Subject to _Section 5.05_ , the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless any Person (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ") to the fullest
extent permitted under the DLLCA, as the same now exists or may hereafter be
amended, substituted or replaced (but, in the case of any such amendment,
substitution or replacement only to the extent that such amendment,
substitution or replacement permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than the Company is providing immediately prior to such
amendment), against all expenses, liabilities, damages, and losses (including
attorneys' fees, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines, interest or
penalties) incurred or suffered by such Person (or one or more of such
Person's Affiliates) by reason of the fact that such Person is or was a Member
or Affiliate thereof or is or was serving as the Managing Member or an
Affiliate thereof or is or was an Officer or is or was serving at the request
of the Company as an officer, director, principal, member, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Person
shall be indemnified for (i) any expenses, liabilities, damages and losses
suffered that are attributable to such Indemnified Person's or its Affiliates'
gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violation of Law or for any
present or future breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants by
such Indemnified Person or its Affiliates contained herein or in the other
agreements with the Company or (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, any taxes or
related interest or penalties imposed on such Indemnified Person, including,
with respect to any Member, as a result of any allocations to such Member
pursuant to _Section 5.04_. Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by
any such Indemnified Person in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the
Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, including any
appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

  

  

 

28  

  

(b) The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in
this _Section 7.04_ shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, bylaw, action by
the Managing Member or otherwise.

  

(c) The Company shall maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance,
or substantially equivalent insurance, at its expense, to protect any
Indemnified Person against any expense, liability or loss described in
_Section 7.04(a)_ whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify
such Indemnified Person against such expense, liability, damage or loss under
the provisions of this _Section 7.04_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to purchase and maintain property, casualty and liability
insurance in types and at levels customary for companies of similar size
engaged in similar lines of business, as determined in good faith by the
Managing Member, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to purchase directors' and officers' liability insurance (including employment
practices coverage) with a carrier and in an amount determined necessary or
desirable as determined in good faith by the Managing Member.

  

(d) If this _Section 7.04_ or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall
nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person pursuant to
this _Section 7.04_ to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion
of this _Section 7.04_ that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

Section 7.05 _Members Right to Act_. For matters that require the approval of
the Members, the Members shall act through meetings and written consents as
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) below:

  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement, acts by the
Members holding a majority of the Voting Units (which shall in all cases
include the Managing Member) voting together as a single class, shall be the
acts of the Members. Any Member entitled to vote at a meeting of Members or to
express consent or dissent to Company action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another Person or Persons to act for it by proxy. An electronic mail
or similar transmission by the Member, or a photographic, photostatic,
facsimile or similar reproduction of a writing executed by the Member shall
(if stated thereon) be treated as a proxy executed in writing for purposes of
this _Section 7.05(a)_. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after eleven
(11) months from the date thereof, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A proxy shall be revocable unless the proxy form conspicuously states
that the proxy is irrevocable and that the proxy is coupled with an interest.
Should a proxy designate two or more Persons to act as proxies, unless that
instrument shall provide to the contrary, a majority of such Persons present
at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have
and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby
conferred, or, if only one be present, then such powers may be exercised by
that one; or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any
particular issue, the Company shall not be required to recognize such proxy
with respect to such issue if such proxy does not specify how the votes that
are the subject of such proxy are to be voted with respect to such issue.

  

(b) The actions by the Members permitted hereunder may be taken at a meeting
called by the Managing Member or by the Members holding a majority of the
Voting Units entitled to vote on such matter on at least five (5) Business
Days' prior written notice to the other Members entitled to vote, which notice
shall state the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is being called.

  

  

 

29  

  

The actions taken by the Members entitled to vote or consent at any meeting
(as opposed to by written consent), however called and noticed, shall be as
valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if
(but not until), either before, at or after the meeting, the Members entitled
to vote or consent as to whom it was improperly held sign a written waiver of
notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the
minutes thereof. The actions by the Members entitled to vote or consent may be
taken by vote of the Members entitled to vote or consent at a meeting or by
written consent, so long as such consent is signed by Members having not less
than the minimum number of Units that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all Members entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted. Prompt notice of the action so taken, which shall state the
purpose or purposes for which such consent is required and may be delivered
via email, without a meeting shall be given to those Members entitled to vote
or consent who have not consented in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to give any such notice shall not affect the validity of the
action taken by such written consent. Any action taken pursuant to such
written consent of the Members shall have the same force and effect as if
taken by the Members at a meeting thereof.

  

Section 7.06 _Inspection Rights_. The Managing Member may, but shall not be
required to, permit any Member and each of its designated representatives to
(i) visit and inspect any of the properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, all at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, (ii) examine
the corporate and financial records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and make copies thereof or extracts therefrom, or (iii) consult with the
Managing Members, Officers, employees and independent accountants of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries concerning the affairs, finances and
accounts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The presentation of an
executed written consent of the Managing Member by any Member to the Company's
independent accountants shall constitute the Company's permission to its
independent accountants to participate in discussions with such Persons and
their respective designated representatives. No Member (other than GE), unless
permitted by the Managing Member, shall have any inspection rights under
Section 18-305 of the DLLCA.

  

ARTICLE VIII 
  
 BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS, AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

  

Section 8.01 _Records and Accounting_. The Company shall keep, or cause to be
kept, appropriate books and records with respect to the Company's business,
including all books and records necessary to provide any information, lists
and copies of documents required to be provided pursuant to applicable Laws.
All matters concerning (a) the determination of the relative amount of
allocations and Distributions among the Members pursuant to _Articles III_ and
_IV_ and (b) accounting procedures and determinations, and other
determinations not specifically and expressly provided for by the terms of
this Agreement, shall be determined by the Managing Member, whose
determination shall be final and conclusive as to all of the Members absent
manifest clerical error.

  

  

 

30  

  

Section 8.02 _Fiscal Year_. The Fiscal Year of the Company shall end on
December 31 of each year or such other date as may be established by the
Managing Member.

  

ARTICLE IX 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  

Section 9.01 _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

  

(a) The Managing Member shall be responsible for the preparation and timely
filing of all tax returns required to be filed by the Company, including
arranging for the preparation of such tax return by an accounting firm or
other qualified adviser; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to filing the
Company's Internal Revenue Service Form 1065, any material foreign, state or
local income tax return of the Company, or any material franchise tax return
of the Company, the Managing Member shall submit such tax return no less than
thirty (30) days prior to its due date to GE for its review, and shall not
file or cause to be filed any such tax return with the applicable taxing
authority without the consent of GE, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. GE may object to the filing of such tax return by
delivering a written notice to the Managing Member within ten (10) days of
receipt of such tax return from the Company. Such written notice shall specify
the item or items included in the tax return disputed by GE. After delivery of
such written notice, GE and the Managing Member shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute. If GE and the Managing Member are
unable to resolve such dispute within five days, the disputed item or items
shall be resolved within ten (10) days using the procedures set forth in the
Tax Matters Agreement. If GE does not object to the filing of such tax return
within ten (10) days of receipt of such tax return from the Managing Member,
GE shall be deemed to have consented to the filing of such tax return by the
Managing Member. The cost of such preparation and filing shall be borne by the
Company.

  

(b) Except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement, the Managing Member
shall make any decisions with respect to tax elections or other decisions
relating to taxes of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
any election that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on GE
that is material and disproportionate as to its effect on GE (as compared to
its effect on Newco), such election shall not be made without the consent of
GE, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Managing
Member shall cause the Company to furnish to each Member (i) as soon as
reasonably practicable after the close of each Fiscal Year such information
concerning the Company as is reasonably required for the preparation of such
Member's income tax returns and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after
the close of each of the Company's first three fiscal quarters of each Fiscal
Year, such information concerning the Company as is reasonably required to
enable the Member to calculate and pay estimated taxes, and (iii) information
(including without limitation a Schedule K-1 and any comparable foreign, state
and local tax forms) as shall be necessary to enable each Member to prepare
its income tax returns and shall provide such information no later than five
Business Days after the filing of the Company's appropriate tax returns.

  

Section 9.02 _Tax Controversies_. The Managing Member is hereby designated as
"tax matters partner" of the Company (the " _Tax Matters Partner_ ") for
purposes of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code (as in effect prior to repeal of
such section pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015).

  

  

 

31  

  

The Managing Member shall designate the "partnership representative" of the
Company (the " _Partnership Representative_ ") for purposes of Section 6223 of
the Code and all applicable non-U.S. tax purposes. In the event of any
examinations of the Company's affairs by tax authorities, including resulting
administrative and judicial proceedings, the Managing Member shall control the
conduct of such examinations at the Company's expense and to expend Company
funds for professional services reasonably incurred in connection therewith;
_provided_ , that the Managing Member shall promptly provide each other Member
a written notice informing the Members that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, is the subject of an examination by a tax
authority with respect to a material tax return or that could result in a
material amount of taxes (including taxes imposed on Members), shall keep each
other Member reasonably informed of material developments relating to such
examination and not settle such examination, to the extent relating to a
matter that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any
Member that is material and disproportionate as to its effect on other Members
or their Affiliates, without the consent of such adversely affected Member,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

Section 9.03 _Member Tax Matters_. Each Member agrees that such Member shall
not, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, treat, on such Member's
separate income tax returns, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit relating to such Member's interest in the Company in a manner
inconsistent with the treatment of such item by the Company as reflected in
the Form K-1 or other information statement furnished by the Company to such
Member pursuant to _Section 9.01_.

  

ARTICLE X 
  
 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF UNITS; PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

  

Section 10.01 _Transfers by Members_. No holder of Units or shares of Class B
Common Stock may Transfer or permit the Transfer of any interest in any Units
or shares of Class B Common Stock, except Transfers (a) pursuant to and in
accordance with the Exchange Agreement, (b) pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 10.02_ , (c) by the holders of Equity Securities in Newco (other than
Class B Common Stock) or (d) approved in writing by the Managing Member.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Transfer" shall not include an event that
terminates the existence of a Member for income tax purposes (including a
change in entity classification of a Member under Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3, termination of a partnership pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of
the Code, a sale of assets by, or liquidation of, a Member pursuant to an
election under Sections 336 or 338 of the Code, or merger, severance, or
allocation within a trust or among sub-trusts of a trust that is a Member),
but that does not in each case terminate the existence of such Member under
applicable state law (or, in the case of a trust that is a Member, does not
terminate the trusteeship of the fiduciaries under such trust with respect to
all the Company Interests of such trust that is a Member).

  

Section 10.02 _Permitted Transfers_. The restrictions contained in _Section
10.01_ shall not apply to any Transfer (each, together with any Transfer
pursuant to and in accordance with the Exchange Agreement, a " _Permitted
Transfer_ ") pursuant to (i) Section 4.2(a)(iii) of the Stockholders
Agreement, (ii) a Transfer by a Member to Newco or any of its Subsidiaries and
(iii) a Transfer to an Affiliate of such Member; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(A) the restrictions contained in this Agreement will continue to apply to
Units after any Permitted Transfer of such Units, and (B) in the case of the
foregoing clause (iii), the transferees of the Units so Transferred shall
agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the
Exchange Agreement, the transferor will deliver a written notice to the
Company and the Members, which will disclose in reasonable detail the identity
of the proposed transferee.

  

  

 

32  

  

If a Member Transfers Units pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii) and, while
the Transferee continues to hold any Units, such Permitted Transferee ceases
to qualify as an Affiliate (other than by virtue of a Permitted Spin
Transaction) in relation to the initial Transferor Member from which such
Permitted Transferee received such Units (directly or indirectly through a
series of Transfers) pursuant to such clause (iii)) (an " _Unwinding Event_
"), then the relevant initial Transferor shall (1) promptly notify the other
Members and the Company of the pending occurrence of such Unwinding Event and
(2) take all actions necessary prior to such Unwinding Event to effect a
Transfer of all of the Units held by the relevant Permitted Transferee either
back to such initial Transferor or to another Person who qualifies as an
Affiliate of such initial Transferor, in each case subject to _Section 10.04_.
A " _Permitted Transferee_ " is a Transferee of a Permitted Transfer
contemplated by clauses (i) and (iii) of the first sentence of this _Section
10.02_.

  

Section 10.03 _Restricted Units Legend_. The Units have not been registered
under the Securities Act and, therefore, in addition to the other restrictions
on Transfer contained in this Agreement, cannot be sold unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
then available. To the extent such Units have been certificated, each
certificate evidencing Units and each certificate issued in exchange for or
upon the Transfer of any Units (if such securities remain Units as defined
herein after such Transfer) shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a
legend in substantially the following form:

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED ON [●],
AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
THEREUNDER. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO
ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SPECIFIED IN THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY
AGREEMENT OF [NEWCO], LLC, AS MAY BE AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME,
AND [NEWCO], LLC RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE THE TRANSFER OF SUCH SECURITIES
UNTIL SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED WITH RESPECT TO ANY TRANSFER. A COPY
OF SUCH CONDITIONS SHALL BE FURNISHED BY [NEWCO], LLC TO THE HOLDER HEREOF
UPON WRITTEN REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE."

  

The Company shall imprint such legend on certificates (if any) evidencing
Units. The legend set forth above shall be removed from the certificates (if
any) evidencing any units which cease to be Units in accordance with the
definition thereof.

  

Section 10.04 _Transfer_. Prior to Transferring any Units (other than
Transfers to the Company pursuant to the Exchange Agreement), the Transferring
holder of Units shall cause the prospective Transferee to be bound by this
Agreement as provided in _Section 10.02_ and any other agreements (including
the Exchange Agreement) executed by the holders of Units and relating to such
Units in the aggregate (collectively, the " _Other Agreements_ "), and shall
cause the prospective Transferee to execute and deliver to the Company and the
other holders of Units counterparts of this Agreement and any applicable Other
Agreements.

  

  

 

33  

  

Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Units in violation of any provision
of this Agreement (including any prohibited indirect Transfers) (a) shall be
void, and (b) the Company shall not record such Transfer on its books or treat
any purported Transferee of such Units as the owner of such securities for any
purpose.

  

Section 10.05 _Assignee 's Rights._

  

(a) The Transfer of a Company Interest in accordance with this Agreement shall
be effective as of the date of its Transfer (assuming compliance with all of
the conditions to such Transfer set forth herein), and such Transfer shall be
shown on the books and records of the Company. Profits, Losses and other
Company items shall be allocated between the transferor and the Assignee
according to Section 706 of the Code, using any permissible method as
determined in the reasonable discretion of the Managing Member. Distributions
made before the effective date of such Transfer shall be paid to the
transferor, and Distributions made after such date shall be paid to the
Assignee.

  

(b) Unless and until an Assignee becomes a Member pursuant to _Article XI_ ,
the Assignee shall not be entitled to any of the rights granted to a Member
hereunder or under applicable Law, other than the rights granted specifically
to Assignees pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
without relieving the transferring Member from any such limitations or
obligations as more fully described in _Section 10.06_ , such Assignee shall
be bound by any limitations and obligations of a Member contained herein that
a Member would be bound on account of the Assignee's Company Interest
(including the obligation to make Capital Contributions on account of such
Company Interest).

  

Section 10.06 _Assignor 's Rights and Obligations_. Any Member who shall
Transfer any Company Interest in a manner in accordance with this Agreement
shall cease to be a Member with respect to such Units or other interest and
shall no longer have any rights or privileges, or, except as set forth in this
_Section 10.06_ , duties, liabilities or obligations, of a Member with respect
to such Units or other interest (it being understood, however, that the
applicable provisions of _Sections 6.08_ and _7.04_ shall continue to inure to
such Person's benefit), except that unless and until the Assignee (if not
already a Member) is admitted as a Substituted Member in accordance with the
provisions of _Article XI_ (the " _Admission Date_ "), (i) such assigning
Member shall retain all of the duties, liabilities and obligations of a Member
with respect to such Units or other interest, and (ii) the Managing Member
may, in its sole discretion, reinstate all or any portion of the rights and
privileges of such Member with respect to such Units or other interest for any
period of time prior to the Admission Date. Nothing contained herein shall
relieve any Member who Transfers any Units or other interest in the Company
from any liability of such Member to the Company with respect to such Company
Interest that may exist on the Admission Date or that is otherwise specified
in the DLLCA and incorporated into this Agreement or for any liability to the
Company or any other Person for any materially false statement made by such
Member (in its capacity as such) or for any present or future breaches of any
representations, warranties or covenants by such Member (in its capacity as
such) contained herein or in the other agreements with the Company.

  

  

 

34  

  

Section 10.07 _Overriding Provisions_.

  

(a) Any Transfer in violation of this _Article X_ shall be null and void ab
initio, and the provisions of _Sections 10.05_ and _10.06_ shall not apply to
any such Transfers. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person to whom a Transfer
is made or attempted in violation of this _Article X_ shall not become a
Member, shall not be entitled to vote on any matters coming before the Members
and shall not have any other rights in or with respect to any rights of a
Member of the Company. The approval of any Transfer in any one or more
instances shall not limit or waive the requirement for such approval in any
other or future instance. The Managing Member shall promptly amend the
Schedule of Members to reflect any Permitted Transfer pursuant to this
_Article X_.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Section 10.01_ and _Article XI_ ),
in no event shall any Member Transfer any Units to the extent such Transfer
would:

  

(i) result in the violation of the Securities Act, or any other applicable
federal, state or foreign Laws;

  

(ii) cause an assignment under the Investment Company Act;

  

(iii) cause the Company to fail to qualify as a partnership or disregarded
entity for federal income tax purposes or, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, such Transfer was effected on or through an "established
securities market" or a "secondary market or the substantial equivalent
thereof," as such terms are used in Section 1.7704-1 of the Treasury
Regulations;

  

(iv) cause the Company to be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" or to
be taxed as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704 of the Code or successor
provision of the Code; or

  

(v) result in the Company having more than one hundred (100) partners, within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(1) (determined
pursuant to the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)).

  

ARTICLE XI 
  
 ADMISSION OF MEMBERS

  

Section 11.01 _Substituted Members_. Subject to the provisions of _Article X_
hereof, in connection with the Permitted Transfer of a Company Interest
hereunder, the transferee shall __ become a substituted Member (" _Substituted
Member_ ") on the effective date of such Transfer, which effective date shall
not be earlier than the date of compliance with the conditions to such
Transfer, and such admission shall be shown on the Schedule of Members.

  

  

 

35  

  

Section 11.02 _Additional Members_. Subject to the provisions of _Article X_
hereof, any Person may be admitted to the Company as an additional Member (any
such Person, an " _Additional Member_ ") only upon furnishing to the Managing
Member (a) counterparts of this Agreement and any applicable Other Agreements
and (b) such other documents or instruments as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to effect such Person's admission as a Member (including entering
into such documents as the Managing Member may deem appropriate in its
reasonable discretion). Such admission shall become effective on the date on
which the Managing Member determines in its reasonable discretion that such
conditions have been satisfied and when any such admission is shown on the
Schedule of Members.

  

ARTICLE XII 
  
 WITHDRAWAL AND RESIGNATION; TERMINATION OF RIGHTS

  

Section 12.01 _Withdrawal and Resignation of Members_. No Member shall have
the power or right to withdraw or otherwise resign as a Member from the
Company prior to the dissolution and winding up of the Company pursuant to
_Article XIII_. Any Member, however, that attempts to withdraw or otherwise
resign as a Member from the Company without the prior written consent of the
Managing Member upon or following the dissolution and winding up of the
Company pursuant to _Article XIII_ , but prior to such Member receiving the
full amount of Distributions from the Company to which such Member is entitled
pursuant to _Article XIII_ , shall be liable to the Company for all damages
(including all lost profits and special, indirect and consequential damages)
directly or indirectly caused by the withdrawal or resignation of such Member.
Upon a Transfer of all of a Member's Units in a Transfer permitted by this
Agreement, subject to the provisions of _Section 10.06_ , such Member shall
cease to be a Member.

  

ARTICLE XIII 
  
 DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

  

Section 13.01 _Dissolution_. The Company shall not be dissolved by the
admission of Additional Members or Substituted Members or the attempted
withdrawal or resignation of a Member. The Company shall dissolve, and its
affairs shall be wound up, only upon:

  

(a) the unanimous decision of the Managing Member together with the Members
that then hold Voting Units to dissolve the Company;

  

(b) a dissolution of the Company under Section 18-801(a)(4) of the DLLCA,
unless the Company is continued without dissolution as permitted under Section
18-801(a)(4) of the DLLCA; or

  

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Company under Section
18-802 of the DLLCA.

  

Except as otherwise set forth in this _Article XIII_ , the Company is intended
to have perpetual existence. An Event of Withdrawal shall not cause
dissolution of the Company and the Company shall continue in existence subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

 

36  

  

Section 13.02 _Liquidation and Termination_. On dissolution of the Company,
the Managing Member shall act as liquidator or may appoint one or more Persons
as liquidator. The liquidators shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs
of the Company and make final Distributions as provided herein and in the
DLLCA. The costs of liquidation shall be borne as a Company expense. Until
termination of the Company, the liquidators shall continue to operate the
Company properties with all of the power and authority of the Managing Member.
The steps to be accomplished by the liquidators are as follows:

  

(a) as promptly as possible after dissolution and again after final
liquidation, the liquidators shall cause a proper accounting to be made by a
recognized firm of certified public accountants of the Company's assets,
liabilities and operations through the last day of the calendar month in which
the dissolution occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as applicable;

  

(b) the liquidators shall pay, satisfy or discharge from Company funds, or
otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof (including
the establishment of a cash fund for contingent liabilities in such amount and
for such term as the liquidators may reasonably determine): first, all
expenses incurred in liquidation; and second, all of the debts, liabilities
and obligations of the Company; and

  

(c) all remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed to the Members in
accordance with _Article IV_ by the end of the Taxable Year during which the
liquidation of the Company occurs (or, if later, by ninety (90) days after the
date of the liquidation).

  

Section 13.03 _Deferment; Distribution in Kind_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of _Section 13.02_ , but subject to the order of priorities set
forth therein, if upon dissolution of the Company the liquidators determine
that an immediate sale of part or all of the Company's assets would be
impractical or would cause undue loss (or would otherwise not be beneficial)
to the Members, the liquidators may, in their sole discretion, defer for a
reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to
satisfy Company liabilities (other than loans to the Company by Members) and
reserves. Subject to the order of priorities set forth in _Section 13.02_ ,
the liquidators may, in their sole discretion, distribute to the Members, in
lieu of cash, either (a) all or any portion of such remaining Company assets
in-kind in accordance with the provisions of _Section 13.02(c)_ , (b) as
tenants in common and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 13.02(c)_
, undivided interests in all or any portion of such Company assets or (c) a
combination of the foregoing. Any such Distributions in kind shall be subject
to (y) such conditions relating to the disposition and management of such
assets as the liquidators deem reasonable and equitable and (z) the terms and
conditions of any agreements governing such assets (or the operation thereof
or the holders thereof) at such time. Any Company assets distributed in kind
will first be written up or down to their Fair Market Value, thus creating
Profit or Loss (if any), which shall be allocated in accordance with _Article
V_. The liquidators shall determine the Fair Market Value of any property
distributed in accordance with the valuation procedures set forth in _Article
XIV_.

  

Section 13.04 _Cancellation of Certificate_. On completion of the winding up
and liquidation of the Company as provided herein, the Company is terminated
(and the Company shall not be terminated prior to such time), and the Managing
Member (or such other Person or Persons as the DLLCA may require or permit)
shall file a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, cancel any other filings made pursuant to this Agreement that are or
should be canceled and take such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Company. The Company shall be deemed to continue in existence
for all purposes of this Agreement until it is terminated pursuant to this
_Section 13.04_.

  

  

 

37  

  

Section 13.05 _Reasonable Time for Winding Up_. A reasonable time shall be
allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Company
and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to _Sections 13.02_ and _13.03_ in
order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up.

  

Section 13.06 _Return of Capital_. The liquidators shall not be personally
liable for the return of Capital Contributions or any portion thereof to the
Members (it being understood that any such return shall be made solely from
and to the extent of Company assets available therefor).

  

ARTICLE XIV 
  
 VALUATION

  

Section 14.01 _Determination_. " _Fair Market Value_ " of a specific asset
will mean the amount which the seller would receive in an all-cash sale of
such asset in an arms-length transaction with a willing unaffiliated third
party buyer, with neither party having any compulsion to buy or sell,
consummated on the day immediately preceding the date on which the event
occurred which necessitated the determination of the Fair Market Value (and
after giving effect to any transfer taxes payable in connection with such
sale), as such amount is determined by the Managing Member (or, if pursuant to
_Section 13.02_ , the liquidators) in its good faith judgment using all
factors, information and data it deems to be pertinent.

  

Section 14.02 _Dispute Resolution_. If any Member or Members dispute the
accuracy of any determination of Fair Market Value in accordance with _Section
14.01_ , and the Managing Member and such Member(s) are unable to agree on the
determination of the Fair Market Value of any asset of the Company, the
Managing Member and such Member(s) shall each select a nationally recognized
investment banking firm experienced in valuing assets or securities of
similarly situated companies in the Company's industry (the " _Appraisers_ "),
who shall each determine the Fair Market Value of the asset or the Company (as
applicable) in accordance with the provisions of _Section 14.01_. The
Appraisers shall be instructed to give written notice of their determination
of the Fair Market Value of the asset or the Company (as applicable) within
thirty (30) days of their appointment as Appraisers. If Fair Market Value as
determined by an Appraiser is higher than Fair Market Value as determined by
the other Appraiser by 10% or more, and the Managing Member and such Member(s)
do not otherwise agree on a Fair Market Value, the original Appraisers shall
designate a third Appraiser meeting the same criteria used to select the
original two, whose determination shall be binding. If Fair Market Value as
determined by an Appraiser selected by the Members is within 10% of the Fair
Market Value as determined by the other such Appraiser (but not identical),
and the Managing Member and such Member(s) do not otherwise agree on a Fair
Market Value, the Managing Member shall select the Fair Market Value of one of
such Appraisers. The fees and expenses of the Appraisers shall be borne by the
Company.

ARTICLE XV

representatives.

binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended
to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder

Section 15.05 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance_.

  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT
OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION
OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

  

  

 

40  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "
_Chancery Court_ ") or, if, but only if, the Chancery Court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware with
respect to any dispute, action or other proceeding arising out of, relating to
or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action arising
out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement in any court other
than the courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (iv) waives
any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising
out of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 15.05_ shall prevent any party
from bringing an action or proceeding in any jurisdiction to enforce any
judgment of the Chancery Court or any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, as applicable. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that service
of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in _Section 15.03_ shall be effective service
of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement.

  

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that,
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party

whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to (i) a decree or order
of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach.

  

Section 15.06 _Counterparts; Electronic Transmission of Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different

shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

Section 15.07 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.

permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

  

Section 15.08 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it
legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not
containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of
the parties hereto shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

  

  

 

41  

  

Section 15.09 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Transaction Agreement
and, as applicable, the other Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the
Transaction Agreement), constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in favor of any Person.

  

Section 15.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified upon the
consent of the Majority Members and the Managing Member. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment or modification (a) to this _Section 15.10_ may be
made without the prior written consent of the Managing Member and each of the
Members, (b) to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement which terms
and conditions expressly require the approval or action of certain Persons may

may be waived at any time by any of the parties entitled to the benefit
thereof only by a written instrument signed by each such party granting such

obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of or estopped with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

  

Section 15.12 _Creditors_. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
for the benefit of or enforceable by any creditors of the Company or any of
its Affiliates, and no creditor who makes a loan to the Company or any of its

Wherever a conflict exists between this Agreement and any other agreement,
this Agreement shall control but solely to the extent of such conflict.
References to agreements or other documents shall be deemed to refer to such
agreement or other document as amended, restated, supplemented and/or

ARTICLE II 
  
 EXCHANGE

  

Section 2.01. _Exchange of Paired Interests_. Subject to any restrictions set
forth in the Stockholders Agreement and _Section 2.02(h)_ , the Holder shall
be entitled at any time and from time to time upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof, to surrender Paired Interests to the Company, in
exchange (such exchange, an " _Exchange_ ") for the delivery by the Company to
the Holder of either (i) a number of shares of Class A Common Stock that is
equal to the product of the number of Paired Interests surrendered multiplied
by the Exchange Rate or (ii) at the option of Newco, or the Company on behalf
of Newco, to be exercised pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)_ , a Cash Exchange
Payment; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
no event shall the Holder be entitled to effect an Exchange if and to the
extent that, after the effectiveness of the Exchange and after giving effect
to any disposition of Class A Common Stock that occurs immediately after such
Exchange, the Holder and its Permitted Transferees collectively would
beneficially own (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) more than 50% of
the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock at such time.

  

Section 2.02. _Exchange Procedures; Notices and Revocations_.

  

(a) The Holder may exercise the right to effect an Exchange as set forth in
_Section 2.01_ by delivering a written notice of exchange in respect of the
Paired Interests to be Exchanged substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_
hereto (the " _Notice of Exchange_ "), duly executed by the Holder or the
Holder's duly authorized attorney, to the Company at the address set forth in
_Section 4.03_ during normal business hours, or if any agent for the Exchange
is duly appointed and acting (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), to the office of the
Exchange Agent during normal business hours. If Common Units and/or the Class
B Common Stock are then represented by certificates, certificate(s)
representing at least the number of Common Units and/or Class B Common Stock
being exchanged, with instrument(s) of transfer reasonably acceptable to the
Company and executed in blank, shall be delivered by the Holder to the Company
at the address set forth in _Section 4.03_ during normal business hours or to
the offices of the Exchange Agent during normal business hours.

  

  

 

6  

  

If such certificates have been lost, the Holder may deliver, in lieu of such
certificate(s), an affidavit of lost certificates. Newco shall take such
actions as may be required, including, if applicable, the issuance and sale of
shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company for the delivery by the Company
to the Holder of a number of shares of Class A Common Stock that is equal to
the product of the number of Paired Interests surrendered multiplied by the
Exchange Rate, to ensure the performance by the Company of its obligations
under this _Article II_.

  

(b) Upon receipt of a Notice of Exchange, Newco or the Company on behalf of
Newco may deliver a notice (" _Election Notice_ ") within three (3) Business
Days after receipt by Newco and the Company of such Notice of Exchange, in
which Newco, or the Company on behalf of Newco, may elect for a Cash Exchange
Payment to be provided in an elective Exchange pursuant to _Section 2.01_.
Subject to the proviso of _Section 2.01_ , if no Election Notice is given
within such three (3) Business Day period, Newco, or the Company on behalf of
Newco, shall be deemed not to have made an election for a Cash Exchange
Payment to be provided in the applicable Exchange and shall be required to
deliver Class A Common Stock.

  

(c) _Contingent Notice of Exchange and Revocation by the Holder_.

  

(i) A Notice of Exchange from the Holder may specify that the Exchange is to
be (x) contingent (including as to the timing) upon the consummation of a
purchase by another Person (whether in a tender or exchange offer, an
underwritten offering or otherwise) of shares of any Deliverable Common Stock
into which the Paired Interests are exchangeable, or contingent (including as
to timing) upon the closing of an announced merger, consolidation or other
transaction or event in which any Deliverable Common Stock would be exchanged
or converted or become exchangeable for or convertible into cash or other
securities or property and/or (y) effective upon a specified future date.

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder may withdraw
or amend a Notice of Exchange, in whole or in part, prior to the effectiveness
of the Exchange (including following the delivery of an Election Notice), at
any time prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Exchange Date (or if later, at any time within 24
hours of the delivery of an Election Notice (the " _Election Response Period_
")) by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to Newco and the Company or
the Exchange Agent, specifying (1) the number of withdrawn Paired Interests,
(2) if any, the number of Paired Interests as to which the Notice of Exchange
remains in effect and (3) if the Holder so determines, a new Exchange Date or
any other new or revised information permitted in the Notice of Exchange
(which new Exchange Date shall not be earlier than the date that is three (3)
Business Days after the date such notice of withdrawal is received by Newco
and the Company).

  

  

 

7  

  

(d) Each Exchange shall be deemed to be effective immediately prior to the
close of business on the Exchange Date, and the Exchanging Holder (or other
Person(s) whose name or names in which any Deliverable Common Stock is to be
issued) shall be deemed to be a holder of any Deliverable Common Stock from
and after the effectiveness of the Exchange. As promptly as practicable on or
after the Exchange Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Exchanging Holder (or other Person(s) whose name or names in which any
Deliverable Common Stock is to be issued) the Cash Exchange Payment, or if
applicable, the number of shares of any Deliverable Common Stock deliverable
upon such Exchange, registered in the name of the Holder (or other Person(s)
whose name or names in which any Deliverable Common Stock is to be issued).

  

(e) The shares of any Deliverable Common Stock issued upon an Exchange, other
than any such shares issued in an Exchange registered under the Securities
Act, shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:

  

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT
BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED OTHER THAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (OR OTHER APPLICABLE
LAW), OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM.

  

(f) If (i) any shares of Deliverable Common Stock may be sold pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective by the SEC, (ii) all
of the applicable conditions of Rule 144 are met, or (iii) the legend (or a
portion thereof) otherwise ceases to be applicable, Newco, upon the written
request of the Holder shall promptly provide the Holder or its respective
transferees, without any expense to such Persons (other than applicable
transfer taxes and similar governmental charges, if any) with new certificates
(or evidence of book-entry shares) for securities of like tenor not bearing
the provisions of the legend with respect to which the restriction has
terminated. In connection therewith, the Holder shall provide Newco with such
information in its possession as Newco may reasonably request in connection
with the removal of any such legend.

  

(g) Subject to the Registration Rights Agreement, Newco, the Company and the
Holder shall bear their own respective expenses in connection with the
consummation of any Exchange by the Holder, whether or not any such Exchange
is ultimately consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that Newco will pay any
transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or other similar taxes in connection
with, or arising by reason of, any Exchange; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
any shares of Deliverable Common Stock are to be delivered in a name other
than that of the Holder, then the Holder and/or the Person in whose name such
shares are to be delivered shall pay to Newco or the Company, as applicable,
the amount of any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or other similar
taxes in connection with, or arising by reason of, such Exchange or shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Newco and the Company that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article II_ , the Holder
shall not be entitled to effect an Exchange (and, if attempted, any such
Exchange shall be void ab initio), the Company shall have the right to refuse
to honor any request to effect an Exchange, at any time or during any period,
if the Company shall reasonably determine that such Exchange would be
prohibited by any applicable Law, _provided_ this subsection _Section 2.02(h)_
shall not limit the Company's obligations under _Section 2.06(c)_.

  

  

 

8  

  

Section 2.03. _Adjustment_.

  

(a) The Exchange Rate shall be adjusted accordingly if there is any
subdivision (by any stock or unit split, stock or unit dividend or
distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise)
or combination (by reverse stock or unit split, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of the shares of Class B Common
Stock or Common Units that is not accompanied by a substantively identical
subdivision or combination of the Class A Common Stock. If there is any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction in which the Class A Common Stock is converted or changed into
another security, securities or other property, then upon any subsequent
Exchange, an Exchanging Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such
security, securities or other property that such Exchanging Holder would have
received if such Exchange had occurred immediately prior to the effective date
of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, taking into account any adjustment as a result of any subdivision
(by any split, dividend or distribution, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of such
security, securities or other property that occurs after the effective time of
such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction and prior to the effectiveness of the Exchange. For the avoidance
of doubt, if there is any reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization
or other similar transaction in which the Class A Common Stock is converted or
changed into another security, securities or other property, this _Section
2.03(a)_ shall continue to be applicable, mutatis mutandis, with respect to
such security or other property. This Agreement shall apply to, mutatis
mutandis, and all references to "Paired Interests" shall be deemed to include,
any security, securities or other property of Newco or the Company which may
be issued in respect of, in exchange for or in substitution of shares of Class
B Common Stock or Common Units, as applicable, by reason of stock or unit
split, reverse stock or unit split, stock or unit dividend or distribution,
combination, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, merger,
exchange (other than an Exchange) or other transaction.

  

(b) This Agreement shall apply to the Paired Interests held by the Holder and
its Permitted Transferees as of the date hereof, as well as any Paired
Interests hereafter acquired by the Holder and its Permitted Transferees.

  

Section 2.04. _Tender Offers and Other Events with Respect to Newco_. Subject
to the restrictions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, in the event that
a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, merger, recapitalization or
similar transaction with respect to Class A Common Stock (a " _Newco Offer_ ")
is proposed by Newco or is proposed to Newco or its stockholders and approved
by the Board or is otherwise effected or to be effected with the consent or
approval of the Board, the Holder of Paired Interests shall be permitted (and,
in the case of a Newco Change of Control Transaction that occurs after (but
not upon) the Trigger Date (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement),
required) to participate in such Newco Offer by delivery of a Notice of
Exchange (which Notice of Exchange shall, in the case of a Newco Change of
Control Transaction that occurs after (but not upon) the Trigger Date, be
deemed delivered to the Company without any action by the Holder, and in any
case shall be effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Newco
Offer (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be contingent upon such Newco
Offer and not be effective if such Newco Offer is not consummated)).

  

  

 

9  

  

In the case of a Newco Offer proposed by Newco, Newco and the Holder will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take all such actions and do all
such things as are necessary or desirable to enable and permit the Holder of
Paired Interests to participate in such Newco Offer to the same extent or on
an economically equivalent basis as the holders of shares of Class A Common
Stock without discrimination; _provided_ , _however_ , that without limiting
the generality of this sentence (and without limiting the ability of the
Holder to Exchange Paired Interests at any time pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement), Newco will, other than in the case of a Newco Change of Control
Transaction that occurs after (but not upon) the Trigger Date, use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Holder may participate in each such
Newco Offer without being required to Exchange Paired Interests. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Holder of Paired Interests be
entitled to receive in such Newco Offer aggregate consideration for each
Paired Interest that is greater than the consideration payable in respect of
each share of Class A Common Stock in connection with a Newco Offer (it being
understood that payments under or in respect of the Tax Matters Agreement
shall not be considered part of any such consideration). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Company makes a Cash
Exchange Payment to effect an Exchange made to participate in a Newco Offer,
the Cash Exchange Payment shall equal the consideration payable in the Newco
Offer for the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which the Paired
Interests are exchangeable. A " _Newco Change of Control Transaction_ " shall
mean (a) a merger or consolidation in which (i) Newco is a constituent party
or (ii) a subsidiary of Newco is a constituent party and Newco issues shares
of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation, except any such
merger or consolidation involving Newco or a subsidiary of Newco in which the
holders of shares of capital stock of Newco outstanding immediately prior to
such merger or consolidation continue to hold, or whose shares of capital
stock of Newco are converted into or exchanged for shares of capital stock
that represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, a
majority, by voting power, of the capital stock of (A) the surviving or
resulting corporation or other entity or (B) if the surviving or resulting
corporation or other entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary of another
corporation or other entity immediately following such merger or
consolidation, the parent corporation or other entity of such surviving or
resulting corporation or other entity, (b) the sale, lease, transfer,
exclusive license or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, by Newco or any subsidiary of Newco of all or
substantially all the assets of Newco and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,
or the sale or disposition (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of
one or more subsidiaries of Newco if substantially all of the assets of Newco
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary or
subsidiaries, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or
other disposition is to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco or (c) the
acquisition by any Person (other than the Holder or Affiliate thereof) of a
majority of the outstanding Equity Securities (as defined in the LLC
Agreement) of Newco entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to
the Board. In the event of a Newco Change of Control Transaction that occurs
after (but not upon) the Trigger Date and that is approved by the Board after
(but not upon) the Trigger Date and, to the extent required by applicable Law
or the certificate of incorporation of Newco, the holders of Newco's common
stock, the Holder shall take all action reasonably necessary or appropriate to
cause all Paired Interests to be exchanged for shares of Class A Common Stock
prior to (but which exchange may be contingent on) the consummation of such
Newco Change of Control Transaction.

  

  

 

10  

  

Section 2.05. _Listing of Deliverable Common Stock_. Newco shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all Class A Common Stock issued upon an
Exchange to be listed on the same national securities exchange upon which the
outstanding Class A Common Stock may be listed or traded at the time of such
issuance.

  

Section 2.06. _Deliverable Common Stock to be Issued; Capital Structure;
Cancellation of Paired Units_.

  

(a) Newco shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon an
Exchange, the maximum number of shares of Deliverable Common Stock as shall be
deliverable upon Exchange of all then-outstanding Paired Interests and shall
take such other actions as are necessary to preserve the one-to-one ratio
between the number of Common Units owned by Newco and the number of shares of
Class A Common Stock then-outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained herein shall be construed to preclude Newco or the Company from
satisfying its obligations in respect of an Exchange by delivery of shares of
Deliverable Common Stock that are held in the treasury of Newco or any of its
subsidiaries or by delivery of purchased shares of Deliverable Common Stock
(which may or may not be held in the treasury of Newco or any subsidiary
thereof). Newco and the Company represent, warrant and covenant that all
shares of Deliverable Common Stock issued upon an Exchange will, upon issuance
thereof, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

  

(b) Newco and the Company shall take all actions necessary so that, at all
times for so long as this Agreement is in effect, subject to _Section 2.03_ ,
the number of Common Units outstanding equals the aggregate number of shares
of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding. Newco shall not
in any manner effect any subdivision (by any stock split, stock dividend or
distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise)
or combination (by reverse stock split, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class
B Common Stock, unless the Company simultaneously effects a subdivision or
combination of the Common Units with an identical ratio. The Company shall not
in any manner effect any subdivision (by any unit split, unit dividend or
distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise)
or combination (by reverse unit split, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the Common Units, unless Newco
simultaneously effects a subdivision or combination of the shares of Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock with an identical ratio.

  

(c) When a Paired Interest has been Exchanged in accordance with this
Agreement, (i) the share of Class B Common Stock constituting a component of
such Paired Interest shall be cancelled by Newco and (ii) the Common Unit
constituting a component of such Paired Interest shall be (A) deemed
transferred from the Exchanging Holder to Newco and, if the Exchange was made
for a Cash Exchange Payment, such Common Unit shall be redeemed (or cancelled
and deemed redeemed) by the Company.

  

  

 

11  

  

Section 2.07. _Distributions_. No Exchange shall impair the right of the
Exchanging Holder to receive any distributions payable on the Common Units so
exchanged in respect of a record date that occurs prior to the Exchange Date
for such Exchange. No adjustments in respect of dividends or distributions on
any Common Unit will be made on the Exchange of any Paired Interest, and if
the Exchange Date with respect to a Common Unit occurs after the record date
for the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Units but before
the date of the payment, then the registered Holder of the Common Unit at the
close of business on the record date will be entitled to receive the dividend
or other distribution payable on the Common Unit on the payment date
notwithstanding the Exchange of the Paired Interests or a default in payment
of the dividend or distribution due on the Exchange Date, and, for the
avoidance of doubt, no Exchanging Holder shall have the right to receive any
distributions (including tax distributions) on any exchanged Common Unit with
a record date that occurs from and after any Exchange Date, _provided_ that an
Exchanging Holder shall have the right to receive a distribution with respect
to the exchanged Common Units immediately prior to the Exchange to the extent
that the Exchanging Holder (i) did not receive its Percentage Interest of a
Tax Distribution (each as defined in the LLC Agreement) with respect to such
Common Units pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(ii) of the LLC Agreement and (ii) has
not received any additional distributions to compensate for the shortfall in
the Tax Distributions with respect to such Common Units between the applicable
Tax Distribution Date and the Exchange Date, in an amount equal to such
shortfall. For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchanging Holder shall not be
entitled to receive, in respect of a single record date, distributions or
dividends both on Common Units exchanged by the Holder and on shares of
Deliverable Common Stock received by the Holder in such Exchange.

Section 4.05. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; WAIVER OF

OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably (i) consents to submit itself to
the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(the " _Chancery Court_ ") or, if, but only if, the Chancery Court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of

constitute one and the same agreement.

  

Section 4.07. _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Agreement shall be assigned (in whole or in
part, as applicable) to any Permitted Transferee to whom Common Units and
shares of Class B Common Stock are transferred in accordance with the LLC
Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement.

  

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other

contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it
legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not
containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of
the parties hereto shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

  

Section 4.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and, as applicable, the other
Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), constitute the

Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in favor of any Person.

  

  

 

15  

  

Section 4.11. _Amendment_. This Agreement may only be amended or modified, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time by a written instrument
signed by (i) Newco, (ii) the Company, and (iii) the Holder.

  

Section 4.12. _Waiver_. Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any
obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein
may be waived at any time by any of the parties entitled to the benefit
thereof only by a written instrument signed by each such party granting such
waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such
obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

  

Section 4.13. _Tax Treatment_. This Agreement shall be treated as part of the
LLC Agreement as described in Section 761(c) of the Code and Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h) and 1.761-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

  

3.1 _Board Composition_.

  

(a) The Company Board shall initially consist of nine (9) members comprised of
(i) five (5) directors, including the chairman of the Company Board,
designated by GE in accordance with the Transaction Agreement (collectively,
with their successors, the " _GE Directors_ "), (ii) the Chief Executive
Officer of BHI immediately prior to date hereof, and (iii) three (3) directors
that are Independent Directors designated by BHI, and reasonably acceptable to
GE, in accordance with the Transaction Agreement (collectively, the " _Initial
BHI Directors_ " and together with the Chief Executive Officer of BHI and the
successors of (ii) and (iii) appointed pursuant to this Agreement, the " _Non-
GE Directors_ ").

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, until the Trigger Date, the proportion of GE
Directors to Non-GE Directors shall remain the same as that set forth in
_Section 3.1(a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , it being understood and agreed
that the proportion of GE Directors and Non-GE Directors relative to the
entire Company Board may decrease as a result of increases in the size of the
Company Board to implement director designation rights granted to a seller or
target company in connection with an arm's length merger of or acquisition by
any member of the Company Group.

  

3.2 _Director Nomination Rights_.

  

(a) Until the Trigger Date, in connection with any annual or special meeting

" _GE Designee_ "). Until the Trigger Date, GE shall have full authority and
ability to nominate, elect and remove the GE Designees in accordance with
_Section 3.2(c)_ in the case of the nomination or election of the GE
Designees. GE shall not designate any person to be a GE Designee who it
believes does not meet the requirements for director nominees as set forth in
the applicable policies of the Company relating to director qualification from
time to time. The Company Board shall promptly and in good faith consider each
GE Designee designated pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ , applying the same
standards as shall be applied for the consideration of other proposed nominees
of the Company Board. In the event that the Company Board fails to approve the
nomination of any GE Designee, GE shall have the right to designate an
alternative GE Designee for consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, current
or former employment of any GE Designee by GE or any of its Subsidiaries or
service by any such GE Designee on the board of directors of GE or any of its
Subsidiaries shall not disqualify such individual from serving on the Company
Board as a GE Designee.

  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 3.2(a)_ , until the Trigger Date, if the size of
the Company Board shall, with GE's prior written approval or otherwise, be
increased or decreased, GE shall have the right to designate one or more GE
Designees to the Company Board such that the total number of GE Directors on
the Company Board shall be proportional (rounded up to the nearest whole
number) to the number of GE Directors on the Company Board set forth in
_Section 3.1_ _(a)_.

  

  

 

7  

  

(c) The Company shall cause each GE Designee and Non-GE Designee whose
nomination has been approved to be included in the slate of nominees
recommended by the Company Board to holders of Company Common Stock for
election (including at any special meeting of stockholders held for the
election of directors) and shall use its best efforts to cause the election of
each such GE Designee and Non-GE Designee, including soliciting proxies in
favor of the election of such persons.

  

(d) Until the Trigger Date, in the event that any GE Director shall cease to
serve as a director for any reason, the vacancy resulting therefrom shall be
filled by the Company Board with a substitute GE Director.

  

(e) From and after the date hereof, in the event of a vacancy on the Company
Board upon the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from
office or other cause of any director who was not a GE Designee, the
Governance and Nominating Committee shall have the sole right to fill such
vacancy or designate a person for nomination, reasonably acceptable to GE, for
election to the Company Board to fill such vacancy (each such person, a "
_Non-GE Designee_ ").

  

(f) Until the Trigger Date, the Company shall avail itself of all available
"controlled company" exceptions to the corporate governance listing standards
of the NYSE.

  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, GE shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to waive any and all of the rights granted to it under this
_Section 3.2_ , by delivery of written notice to the Company in accordance
with _Section 7.4_.

  

3.3 _Committees of the Company Board_.

  

(a) _Audit Committee_. The Company shall cause the Audit Committee of the
Company Board to consist of three (3) directors, including at least one (1)
Company Independent Director.

Governance and Nominating Committee of the Company Board (" _Governance and
Nominating Committee_") to consist of five (5) directors, including at least
three (3) Company Independent Directors.

subcommittee (the " _Conflicts Committee_ ") consisting solely of the Company
Independent Directors. The Conflicts Committee (including, without limitation,
in connection with any transactions under _Section 4.2_ or _Section 4.5_ )
shall be fully empowered to obtain assistance from employees of the Company,
including its legal and financial staff, to retain independent legal,
financial and other advisors as the committee deems reasonably necessary and
to not approve any transaction or other matter submitted to the committee for
approval (and such non-approval shall be binding on the Company Board), and
shall have the authority and responsibilities set forth in this Agreement and
as may otherwise be delegated to the Conflicts Committee by the Governance and
Nominating Committee or the Company Board from time to time.

  

  

 

8  

  

(e) _Other Committee Composition_. The number of Non-GE Directors on all
committees of the Company Board not specified in this _Section 3.3_ shall be

GE Directors on the Company Board; _provided_ that each such committee shall
have at least one (1) Company Independent Director.

  

3.4 _Compliance with Organizational Documents_. The Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, take any and all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure continued compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with the provisions of its respective certificate or articles of

(collectively, " _organizational documents_ "), and this Agreement. The
Company shall notify GE in writing promptly after becoming aware of any act or
activity taken or proposed to be taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which resulted or would result in non-compliance with any such
organizational documents or this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the

Board and not to any board of directors or similar governing body of any
Subsidiary of the Company.

  

3.5 _GE Agreement to Vote_. From and after the date hereof, GE shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates to, (a) cause their respective shares of
Company Common Stock to be present for quorum purposes at any Company
stockholder meeting, (b) vote in favor of all Non-GE Designees and (c) not

(ii) Without limiting _Section 4.1(a)(i)_ , from the date hereof until the
Trigger Date, GE shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (x) use the same
degree of care to prevent and restrain the unauthorized use or disclosure of
the Company Confidential Information by them and their Representatives as they
currently use for their own confidential information of a like nature, but in
no event less than a reasonable standard of care and (y) not use any Company
Confidential Information to engage in a Competing Business (as defined in the
Non-Competition Agreement) or to take any other action in violation of the
Non-Competition Agreement (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) or
otherwise in a manner materially detrimental to the interests of the Company;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, following the Trigger Date the
disclosure and use of Company Confidential Information shall be governed by
_Section 4.1(a)(i)_.

  

(b)

  

(i) For a period of three (3) years following the Trigger Date, subject to
_Section 4.1(c)_ and except as contemplated by this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly,
disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person, other than its

in providing services to the Company or any member of the Company Group, or
use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of any third
party, any GE Confidential Information.

  

  

 

10  

  

If any uses or disclosures are made in connection with providing services to
any member of the Company Group under this Agreement or any Transaction
Document, then the GE Confidential Information so used or disclosed shall be
used only as required to perform the services. The Company Group shall use the
same degree of care to prevent and restrain the unauthorized use or disclosure
of the GE Confidential Information by any of their Representatives as they
currently use for their own confidential information of a like nature, but in
no event less than a reasonable standard of care. For purposes of this
_Section 4.1(b)_ , any Information, material or documents relating to the

forecasts, data, translations, studies, memoranda or other documents prepared
by the Company, any member of the Company Group or their respective officers,
directors and Affiliates, that contain or otherwise reflect such information,
material or documents is hereinafter referred to as " _GE Confidential
Information_." " _GE Confidential Information_ " does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is or
becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of a use or
disclosure by any member of the Company Group not otherwise permissible
hereunder, (ii) the Company can demonstrate was or became available to any
member of the Company Group from a source other than GE or its Affiliates or
(iii) is developed independently by a member of the Company Group without
reference to the GE Confidential Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
in the case of clause (ii), the source of such information was not known by a
member of the Company Group to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with,
or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, any
member of the GE Group with respect to such information. In the event any
member of the Company Group receives GE Confidential Information after the
Trigger Date, the Company shall keep and shall cause its Representatives to
keep such GE Confidential Information confidential until the later of (x) a
period of one (1) year following the date such GE Confidential Information was
disclosed to the Company Group and (y) the third anniversary of the Trigger
Date.

  

(ii) Without limiting _Section 4.1(b)(i)_ , from the date hereof until the
Trigger Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (x) use
the same degree of care to prevent and restrain the unauthorized use or
disclosure of the GE Confidential Information by them and their
Representatives as they currently use for their own confidential information
of a like nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care and
(y) not use any GE Confidential Information in a manner materially detrimental
to the interests of GE; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, following
the Trigger Date the disclosure and use of GE Confidential Information shall
be governed by _Section 4.1(b)(i)_.

Affiliates, on the other hand, are requested or required (by oral question,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) by any Governmental Entity or
pursuant to applicable Law or stock exchange requirements to disclose or
provide any Company Confidential Information or GE Confidential Information
(other than with respect to any such information furnished pursuant to the
provisions of _Article V_ of this Agreement), as applicable, the Person
receiving such request or demand, or so required by applicable Law or stock
exchange requirements, shall use all reasonable efforts to provide the other
Party with written notice of such request, demand or requirement as promptly
as practicable under the circumstances so that such other Party shall have an
opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order.

  

  

 

11  

  

The Party receiving such request or demand agrees to take, and cause its
Representatives to take, at the requesting Party's expense, all other
reasonable steps necessary to obtain confidential treatment by the recipient.
Subject to the foregoing, the Party that received such request or demand may
thereafter disclose or provide any Company Confidential Information or GE
Confidential Information, as the case may be, to the extent required by such
Law or stock exchange requirement (as so advised by counsel) or by lawful

4.3 _Preemptive Rights_.

  

(a) To the extent permitted under NYSE rules, the Company hereby grants to GE
the right to purchase its Pro Rata Portion of any Company Securities (other
than any Excluded Securities) that the Company may from time to time propose
to issue or sell to any Person. For purposes of this _Section 4.3_ , "Excluded
Securities" means Company Securities issued in connection with: (i) a grant to
any existing or prospective consultants, employees, officers or directors
pursuant to any stock option, employee stock purchase or similar equity-based
plans or other compensation agreement; (ii) any acquisition by the Company of
the stock, assets, properties or business of any Person; (iii) a stock split,
stock dividend or any similar recapitalization; or (iv) any issuance of
warrants or other similar rights to purchase Company Common Stock to lenders
or other institutional investors in any arm's length transaction providing
debt financing to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent stockholder approval is required under the NYSE rules for
the issuance or sale of Company Securities as provided in this _Section 4.3_ ,
(x) the Company may issue or sell Company Securities to such other Persons
prior to obtaining such stockholder approval in accordance with _Section
4.3(d)_ , and (y) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
such approval, and after receipt of such approval the Company shall issue or
sell the Company Securities (if any) that GE has irrevocably elected to
purchase to GE, on the terms set forth in the relevant Issuance Notice.

  

(b) The Company shall give written notice (an " _Issuance Notice_ ") of any
proposed issuance or sale described in _Section 4.3(a)_ to GE within five (5)
Business Days following any meeting of the Company Board at which any such
issuance or sale is approved or, if the approval of the Company Board is not
required in connection with such issuance or sale, no less than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date of the proposed issuance or sale. The Issuance
Notice shall, if applicable, be accompanied by a written offer from any
prospective purchaser seeking to purchase Company Securities and shall set
forth the material terms and conditions of the proposed issuance, including:

  

  

 

14  

  

(i) the number and class of the Company Securities to be issued and the
percentage of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company such
issuance would represent;

  

(ii) the proposed issuance date, which shall be at least ten (10) Business
Days from the date of the Issuance Notice; and

  

(iii) the proposed purchase price per Company Security.

  

(c) GE shall for a period of ten (10) Business Days following the receipt of
an Issuance Notice have the right to elect irrevocably to purchase its Pro
Rata Portion of the Company Securities at the purchase price set forth in the
Issuance Notice by delivering a written notice to the Company. If, at the
termination of such ten (10) Business Day period, GE shall not have delivered
such notice to the Company, GE shall be deemed to have waived all of its
rights under this _Section 4.3_ with respect to the purchase of such Company
Securities. The closing of any purchase by GE shall be consummated
concurrently with the consummation of the issuance or sale described in the
Issuance Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the closing of any purchase by
GE may be extended beyond the closing of the transaction in the Issuance
Notice to the extent necessary to obtain any required approval or consent of a
Governmental Entity or any other third party (and the Company and GE shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals).

  

(d) Upon the expiration of the ten (10) Business Day period described in
_Section 4.3(c)_, the Company shall be free to sell such Company Securities
that GE has not elected irrevocably to purchase on terms and conditions no
more favorable to the purchasers thereof than those offered to GE in the
Issuance Notice delivered in accordance with _Section 4.3(b)_.

  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 4.3_ shall terminate on the Trigger Date.

  

4.4 _No Violations_.

  

(a) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action or enter into any commitment or agreement
which, to the Company's Knowledge, may reasonably be anticipated to result,
with or without notice and with or without lapse of time or otherwise, in a
contravention or event of default by any member of the GE Group of: (i) any
provisions of applicable Law; (ii) any provision of the organizational
documents of any member of the GE Group; or (iii) any judgment, order or
decree of any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any member of the
GE Group or any of its respective assets. For purposes of this _Section
4.4(a)_ , the " _Company 's Knowledge_" means the actual knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company.

  

(b) GE covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action or enter into any commitment or agreement
which, to GE's Knowledge, may reasonably be anticipated to result, with or
without notice and with or without lapse of time or otherwise, in a
contravention or event of default by any member of the Company Group of: (i)
any provisions of applicable Law; (ii) any provision of the organizational
documents of any member of the Company Group; or (iii) any judgment, order or
decree of any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any member of the
Company Group. For purposes of this _Section 4.4(b)_ , " _GE 's Knowledge_"
means the actual knowledge of the executive officers of GE.

  

  

 

15

documentation reasonably requested by the other for the purpose of evaluating
and ensuring compliance with _Sections 4.4(a)_ and _Section 4.4(b)_ hereof.

than any Related Party Transactions under the Transaction Documents), shall
require the prior written approval of the Conflicts Committee, subject to and
consistent with the Related Party Transactions Policy (as defined below). Any
material amendments or modifications or terminations of any of the Transaction
Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the schedules thereto,
including the Related Party Transaction Policy) or material waivers, consents
(other than any consents of the Company, as managing member of Newco LLC
contemplated by the Newco LLC Agreement where no member of the GE Group is a
counterparty to or beneficiary of the matter in question, and such matter
would not otherwise require the prior written approval of the Conflicts
Committee under this _Section 4.5(a)_ or the Related Party Transactions
Policy) or elections of the Company's or Newco LLC's rights under any of the
Transaction Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the schedules

_however_ , that in circumstances where a provision of the Company's Charter
or Amended and Restated Bylaws or of any Transaction Document (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement) and a GE Policy would each apply, the
provision in the Company's Charter or Amended and Restated Bylaws or
Transaction Document shall control with respect to the Company Group.

  

  

 

16  

  

(b) The Company shall take, and shall cause the other members of the Company
Group to take, all commercially reasonable actions to cause its and the other
members of the Company Group's compliance policies and procedures to (i)
comply with all applicable Laws and (ii) not contravene GE's The Spirit and
the Letter, as amended from time to time; _provided_ that the Company may,
with the approval of the Company Board, adopt a new Company code of conduct
not inconsistent with GE's The Spirit and the Letter.

  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 4.6_ shall terminate on the Trigger Date.

available via the SEC's EDGAR system). Upon reasonable advance notice from GE
of its planned filing date for any given period (including reasonable notice
of any changes to such date), the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to file (x) its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC on or about
the same day as GE's planned filing date with the SEC for its quarterly
reports for the corresponding period and (y) its Annual Report on Form 10-K
with the SEC on or about the same day as GE's planned filing date with the SEC
for its annual reports for the corresponding period; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the Company file such report for any given period prior to GE's
filing of its own such report for the corresponding period, unless the Company
is so required by Law. The Parties shall cooperate in preparing all press
releases and other statements to be made available by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to the public, including information concerning material
developments in the business, properties, results of operations, financial
condition or prospects of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. GE shall
have the right to review, reasonably in advance of public release or release
to financial analysts or investors (1) all press releases and other statements
to be made available by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the public
that relate to financial or accounting matters and (2) all reports and other
information prepared by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for release to
financial analysts or investors; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither GE nor
any member of the GE Group shall disclose any material, non-public information
of the Company except pursuant to policies and procedures mutually agreed upon
by GE and the Company for the disclosure of such information and except as
required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding
anything in this _Article V_ to the contrary, after the Trigger Date, for so
long as members of the GE Group beneficially own at least 10% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on any date during the applicable
fiscal year, GE shall have the right to review such press releases, public
statements, reports and other information in advance if necessary, by virtue
of its equity ownership in the Company, for any member of the GE Group to (1)
comply with applicable financial reporting requirements or its customary
financial reporting practices or (2) respond to any reasonable requests for
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries received by GE from
investors or financial analysts. No press release, report, registration,
information or proxy statement, prospectus or other document which refers, or
contains information with respect, to any member of the GE Group shall be
filed with the SEC or otherwise made public or released to any financial
analyst or investor by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of GE (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) with respect to those portions of such document that
contain information with respect to any member of the GE Group, except as may
be required by Law (in such cases the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to notify the relevant member of the GE Group and to obtain such
member's consent before making such a filing with the SEC or otherwise making
any such information public).

  

  

 

20  

  

(e) _Meetings with Financial Analysts_. The Company shall notify GE reasonably
in advance of the date of all scheduled meetings and conference calls to be
held between the Company and members of the investment community (including
any financial analysts), and of any conferences to be attended by management
of the Company with members of the investment community, and shall consult
with GE as to the appropriate timing for all such meetings, calls and
conferences. The Company shall not schedule such meeting or call or attend
such conference on any date to which GE reasonably objects. The foregoing
shall not require the Company to notify GE of one-on-one discussions between
management of the Company and members of the investment community (including
any financial analysts).

  

(f) _Meetings with Ratings Agencies_. The Company shall notify GE reasonably
in advance of the date of all scheduled meetings and conference calls to be
held between the Company and members of the Ratings Agencies, and shall
consult with GE as to the appropriate timing for all such meetings, calls and
conferences. The Company shall not schedule such meeting or call or attend
such conference on any date to which GE reasonably objects. The foregoing
shall not require the Company to notify GE of one-on-one discussions between
management of the Company and members of the Ratings Agencies.

  

(g) _Earnings Releases_. GE agrees that, unless required by Law (and subject
to the last sentence of this paragraph) or unless the Company shall have
consented thereto, no member of the GE Group will publicly release any
quarterly, annual or other financial information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (" _Company Information_ ") delivered to GE pursuant to this
_Article V_ prior to the time that GE publicly releases financial information
of GE, for the relevant period. GE will consult with the Company on the timing
of their annual and quarterly earnings releases and GE and the Company will
give each other an opportunity to review the information therein relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries and to comment thereon; _provided_ , that GE
shall have the sole right to determine the timing of all such releases if GE
and the Company disagree. Upon reasonable advance notice from GE, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to publicly release its financial
results for each annual and quarterly period on the day of GE's earnings
release within a reasonable time following GE's release. If any member of the
GE Group is required by Law to publicly release such Company Information prior
to the public release of GE's financial information, GE will give the Company
notice of such release of Company Information as soon as practicable but no
later than two (2) days prior to such release of Company Information.

  

(h) _GE Annual Statements_.

  

(i) _Coordination of Auditors ' Opinions_. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enable its independent certified public
accountants (the " _Company Auditors_ ") to complete their audit such that
they will date their opinion on the Company's audited annual financial
statements on the same date that GE's independent certified public accountants
(the " _GE Auditors_ ") date their opinion on the GE Annual Statements, and to
enable GE to meet its timetable for the printing, filing and public
dissemination of the GE Annual Statements.

  

  

 

21  

  

(ii) _Access to Personnel and Working Papers_. The Company will request the
Company Auditors to make available to the GE Auditors both the personnel who
performed or are performing the annual audit of the Company and, consistent
with customary professional practice and courtesy of such auditors with
respect to the furnishing of work papers, work papers related to the annual
audit of the Company, in all cases within a reasonable time before the Company
Auditors' opinion date, so that the GE Auditors are able to perform the
procedures they consider necessary to take responsibility for the work of the
Company Auditors as it relates to the GE Auditors' report on the GE Annual
Statements, all within sufficient time to enable GE to meet its timetable for
the printing, filing and public dissemination of the GE Annual Statements. If
the GE Auditors identify, in any management letter or other correspondence in
connection with the annual audit of GE, any issue with the accounting
principles, any proposed adjustment or any similar area of concern with
respect to the Company Group, GE shall promptly inform the Company and provide
the Company with an excerpt of the applicable portions of such management
letter or correspondence.

  

(i) _Internal Auditors_. The Company shall provide GE, the GE Auditors or
other Representatives of GE reasonable access upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' books and records
so that GE may conduct reasonable audits relating to the financial statements
provided by the Company pursuant to this _Article V_ , as well as to the
internal accounting controls and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  

(j) _Accounting Estimates and Principles_. The Company will give GE reasonable
notice of any proposed material change in accounting estimates or material
changes in accounting principles from those in effect with respect to the
Company Group, and will give GE notice immediately following adoption of any
such changes that are mandated or required by the SEC, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
In connection therewith, the Company will consult with GE, and, if requested
by GE, the Company will consult with the GE Auditors with respect thereto. As
to material changes in accounting principles that could affect any member of
the GE Group, the Company will not make any such changes without GE's prior
written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), excluding changes that are mandated or required by the SEC, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, if such a change would be sufficiently material to be
required to be disclosed in the Company's financial statements as filed with
the SEC or otherwise publicly disclosed therein. If GE so requests, the
Company will be required to obtain the concurrence of the Company Auditors as
to such material change prior to its implementation. GE will use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly respond to any request by the Company to
make a change in accounting principles and, in any event, in sufficient time
to enable the Company to comply with its obligations under _Section 5.1_.

  

(k) _Management Certification_. The Company's chief executive officer and the
Company's chief financial or accounting officer shall submit quarterly
representations (with such changes thereto prescribed by GE consistent with
representations furnished to GE by other business units of GE or as otherwise
required by changes to applicable Law or stock exchange requirements)
attesting to the accuracy and completeness of the financial and accounting
records referred to therein in all material respects and the establishment and
maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting.

  

  

 

22  

  

(l) _Operating Review Process_. The Company shall conduct its strategic and
operational review process on a schedule that is consistent with that of GE's.
GE acknowledges that, as a supplement to the information furnished by the
Company to GE pursuant to _Section 5.3_ , GE shall conduct its strategic and
operational reviews of the Company through participation in meetings or other
activities of the Company Board by the members of the Company Board that are
designated for nomination by GE. To facilitate GE's participation in the
process in this manner, the Company shall hold all of its regularly scheduled
board meetings at which its strategic and operational reviews are discussed
within a time frame consistent with GE's strategic and operational review
process. GE shall make a good faith attempt to conduct all other reviews of
the Company's operations, affairs, finances or results (other than those
required to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements or its
customary financial reporting practices) through participation in meetings or
other activities of the Company Board by the members of the Company Board that
are designated for nomination by GE. In connection with strategic, operational
or other reviews, relevant GE personnel other than the members of the Company
Board designated for nomination by GE may participate at GE's invitation. GE
will notify the Company in advance of any such additional attendees.

  

(m) _Accountants ' Reports_. The Company agrees that, notwithstanding the
occurrence of the Trigger Date, for so long as members of the GE Group
beneficially own at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock on any date during the applicable fiscal year, the Company will promptly
upon receipt of written notice from GE, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the receipt thereof, deliver to GE copies of all
reports submitted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by their
independent certified public accountants, including each report submitted to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries concerning its accounting practices and
systems and any comment letter submitted to management in connection with
their annual audit and all responses by management to such reports and
letters.

  

5.6 _Exchange of Information_. Notwithstanding the occurrence of the Trigger
Date, for so long as members of the GE Group beneficially own at least 10% of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on any date during the
applicable fiscal year, each of GE and the Company, on behalf of itself and
the other members of its respective Group, agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, to the other, at any
time after the date hereof, as soon as reasonably practicable after written
request therefor, any Information in the possession or under the control of
such respective Group which the requesting Party reasonably needs: (i) to
comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the
requesting Party or a member of its Group (including under applicable
securities or Tax Laws) by a Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the
requesting Party or such member of its Group; (ii) for use in any other
judicial, regulatory, administrative, Tax or other proceeding or in order to
satisfy audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation, Tax or other
similar requirements, in each case other than claims or allegations that one
Party to this Agreement has against the other; or (iii) subject to the
foregoing clause (ii), to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or
any Transaction Document; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any
Party determines that any such provision of Information could be commercially
detrimental, violate any Law or agreement, or waive any attorney-client
privilege, the Parties shall take all reasonable measures to permit the
compliance with such obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or
consequence.

  

  

 

23  

  

5.7 _Ownership of Information_. Any Information owned by one Group that is
provided to a requesting Party pursuant to _Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to
remain the property of the providing Group. Unless specifically set forth
herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or
conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such Information.

  

5.8 _Compensation for Providing Information_. In connection with Information
exchanged pursuant to _Section 5.6_ or a party's obligations under _Section
5.12_ , the Party requesting Information or performance agrees to reimburse
the other Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs, if any, of creating,
gathering and copying such Information or otherwise performing, to the extent
that such costs are incurred for the benefit of the requesting Party. Except
as may be otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement or in
any other agreement between the Parties, such costs shall be computed in
accordance with the providing Party's standard methodology and procedures.

  

5.9 _Record Retention_. To facilitate the possible exchange of Information
pursuant to this _Article V_ and other provisions of this Agreement, GE and
the Company agree to use their reasonable best efforts to retain all
Information in their respective possession or control in accordance with the
policies of GE as in effect on the date hereof, to the extent such policies
are communicated in writing to the Company reasonably in advance, or such
other policies as may be reasonably adopted by the appropriate Party after the
date hereof. Neither Party will destroy, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to
destroy, any Information which the other Party may have the right to obtain
pursuant to this Agreement prior to the fifth anniversary of the date hereof
without first using its reasonable efforts to notify the other Party of the
proposed destruction and giving the other Party the opportunity to take
possession of such Information prior to such destruction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of any Information relating to Taxes or employee
benefits, such period shall be extended to the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof); _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , no Party will destroy, or permit any of its
Subsidiaries to destroy, any Information required to be retained by applicable
Law.

  

5.10 _Liability_. No Party shall have any liability to any other Party in the
event that any Information exchanged or provided pursuant to this Agreement
which is an estimate or forecast, or which is based on an estimate or
forecast, is found to be inaccurate in the absence of willful misconduct by
the Party providing such Information. No Party shall have any liability to any
other Party if any Information is destroyed after reasonable best efforts by
such Party to comply with the provisions of _Section 5.9_.

  

  

 

24  

  

5.11 _Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information_.

  

(a) The rights and obligations granted under this _Article V_ are subject to
any specific limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the
sharing, exchange, retention or confidential treatment of Information set
forth in any Transaction Document.

  

(b) Following the Trigger Date, in the event any Information provided by one
Group to the other (other than Information provided pursuant to _Section 5.9_
) is no longer needed for the purposes contemplated by any other Transaction
Document or is no longer required to be retained by applicable Law, the
receiving Party will promptly after request of the other Party either return
to the other Party all Information in a tangible form (including all copies
thereof and all notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) or certify to the
other Party that it has destroyed such Information (and such copies thereof
and such notes, extracts or summaries based thereon).

  

5.12 _Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation_.

  

(a) Except in the case of an adversarial Action by one Party against another
Party, each of GE and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to make
available to each other Party, upon written request, the former, current and
future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of the
members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books, records or other
documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make
available, to the extent that any such person (giving consideration to
business demands of such directors, officers, employees, other personnel and
agents) or books, records or other documents may reasonably be required in
connection with any Action in which the requesting Party may from time to time
be involved, regardless of whether such Action is a matter with respect to
which indemnification may be sought under the Transaction Documents. The
requesting Party shall bear all costs and expenses in connection therewith.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, GE and the Company shall cooperate and
consult to the extent reasonably necessary with respect to any Actions.

  

(c) Without limiting any provision of this _Section 5.12_ , each of GE and the
Company agrees to cooperate, and to cause each member of its respective Group
to cooperate, with each other in the defense of any infringement or similar
claim with respect to any intellectual property and shall not claim to
acknowledge, or permit any member of its respective Group to claim to
acknowledge, the validity or infringing use of any intellectual property of a
third Person in a manner that would hamper or undermine the defense of such
infringement or similar claim except as required by Law.

  

(d) The obligation of GE and the Company to provide witnesses pursuant to this
_Section 5.12_ is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate
cooperation and shall include the obligation to provide as witnesses officers
without regard to whether the witness or the employer of the witness could
assert a possible business conflict (subject to the exception set forth in the
first sentence of _Section 5.12(a)_ ).

  

(e) In connection with any matter contemplated by this _Section 5.12_ , GE and
the Company will enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement so
as to maintain to the extent practicable any applicable attorney-client
privilege, work product immunity or other applicable privileges or immunities
of any member of any Group.

  

  

 

25  

  

5.13 _Privilege_. The provision of any information pursuant to this _Article
V_ shall not be deemed a waiver of any privilege, including privileges arising
under or related to the attorney-client privilege or any other applicable
privilege (a " _Privilege_ "). Neither the Company or any member of the
Company Group nor GE or any member of the GE Group will be required to provide
any information pursuant to this _Article V_ if the provision of such
information would serve as a waiver of any Privilege afforded such
information.

members of the Company Group to irrevocably waive and not to assert any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) prior
representation of the GE OandG Subsidiaries by the GE Law Firms, and (ii)
representation of any member of the GE Group prior to and after the Closing by
the GE Law Firms. As to any privileged attorney-client communications between
the GE Law Firms and any GE OandG Subsidiary prior to the Closing (collectively,
the " _Privileged Communications_ "), the Company, together with any of its
Affiliates, successors or assigns, agrees that no such party may use or rely
on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any
of the Parties after the Closing.

  

(b) The Company further agrees, on behalf of itself and on behalf of the other
members of the Company Group, that all privileged communications in any form
or format whatsoever between or among the GE Law Firms, on the one hand, and
GE, any other member of the GE Group or the GE OandG Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on
the other hand, that relate to the negotiation, documentation and consummation
of the Transactions, any alternative transactions to the Transactions
presented to or considered by GE, any other member of the GE Group or the GE
OandG Subsidiaries, or any dispute arising under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, unless finally adjudicated to be not privileged by a
court of law (collectively, the " _Privileged Deal Communications_ "), shall
remain privileged after the Closing and that the Privileged Deal
Communications and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to GE, shall be controlled by GE, and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Company or any other member of the Company Group. The Company
agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the other members of the
Company Group not to, (i) access or use the Privileged Deal Communications,
(ii) seek to have any member of the GE Group waive the attorney-client
privilege or any other privilege, or otherwise assert that the Company or any
other member of the Company Group has the right to waive the attorney-client
privilege or other privilege applicable to the Privileged Deal Communications,
or (iii) seek to obtain the Privileged Deal Communications or Non-Privileged
Deal Communications (as defined below) from any member of the GE Group or the
GE Law Firms.

  

  

 

30  

  

(c) The Company further agrees, on behalf of itself and on behalf of the other
members of the Company Group, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of the GE Law Firms, GE, any other member of
the GE Group or the GE OandG Subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or other Affiliates or representatives that relate to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions, any
alternative transactions to the Transactions presented to or considered by GE,
any other member of the GE Group or the GE OandG Subsidiaries, or any dispute
arising under this Agreement and that are not Privileged Deal Communications
(collectively, the " _Non-Privileged Deal Communications_ "), shall also
belong solely to GE, shall be controlled by GE and ownership thereof shall not
pass to or be claimed by the Company or any other member of the GE Group.

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Company or any other member of the Company Group, on the one hand, and a
third party other than GE, any other member of the GE Group or their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, then the Company or such other
member of the Company Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such dispute relates to
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the Transactions, none of
the Company or any other member of the Company Group may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of GE. If the Company or any other member of
the Company Group is legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Deal Communications, then the Company shall promptly
(and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) notify GE in writing
(including by making specific reference to this _Section 7.10(d)_ so that GE
can, at its sole cost and expense, seek a protective order, and the Company
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

  

(e) This _Section 7.10_ shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to the
representation by the law firms listed on Schedule 7.10(e) of the Conflicts
Committee and any member of the Company Group (including BHI) and any
successors thereof.

  

7.11 _Counterparts; Electronic Transmission of Signatures_. This Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts and by different Parties in separate
counterparts, and delivered by means of electronic mail transmission or
otherwise, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the
same agreement.

  

  

 

31  

  

  

7.12 _Enforceable by the Conflicts Committee_. All of the Company's and Newco
LLC's rights under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents may be
enforced by the Conflicts Committee; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement
shall require the Conflicts Committee to act on behalf of, or enforce any
rights of, the Company or Newco LLC. Any recovery in connection with an Action
brought by the Conflicts Committee hereunder or thereunder shall be for the
proportionate benefit of all Other Stockholders.

ARTICLE 2 
 REGISTRATION RIGHTS

  

    

2.1

  |  

 _Demand Registration_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

2.1.1 _Request for Registration_.

  

(a) Commencing on the date hereof, subject to any restrictions contained in
the Stockholders Agreement, any Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities
shall have the right to require the Company to file a registration statement
on Form S-1 or S-3 or any other appropriate form under the Securities Act or
Exchange Act for a public offering or the listing or trading of all or part of
its or their Registrable Securities (including any public offering or listing
or trading of securities of (i) the Company or (ii) any wholly owned, direct
or indirect Subsidiary of GE) in connection with and subject to the
requirements applicable to a Permitted Spin Transaction (as defined in the
Newco LLC Operating Agreement) (a " _Demand Registration_ "), by delivering to
the Company written notice stating that such right is being exercised, naming,
if applicable, the Holders whose Registrable Securities are to be included in
such registration (collectively, the " _Demanding Shareholders_ "), specifying
the number of each such Demanding Shareholder's Registrable Securities to be
included in such registration and, subject to _Section 2.1.3_ hereof,
describing the intended method of distribution thereof (a " _Demand Request_
").

  

  

 

3  

  

(b) Subject to _Section 2.1.6_ , the Company shall file the registration
statement in respect of a Demand Registration as soon as practicable and, in
any event, within forty-five (45) days after receiving a Demand Request (the "
_Required Filing Date_ ") and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
same to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such
filing; provided, however, that:

  

(i) the Company shall not be obligated to effect a Demand Registration
pursuant to _Section 2.1.1(a)_ within 60 days after the effective date of a
previous Demand Registration, other than a Shelf Registration pursuant to this
_Article 2_ ; and

  

(ii) the Company shall not be obligated to effect a Demand Registration
pursuant to Section 2.1.1(a) unless the Demand Request is for a number of
Registrable Securities with a market value that is equal to at least $50
million as of the date of such Demand Request.

  

2.1.2 _Shelf Registration_. With respect to any Demand Registration, the
Requesting Holders may require the Company to effect a registration of the
Registrable Securities under a registration statement pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act (or any successor rule) (a " _Shelf Registration_ ")
or any takedown thereunder.

  

2.1.3 _Selection of Underwriters_. At the request of a majority of the
Requesting Holders, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Demand Registration shall be in the form of a "firm commitment" underwritten
offering. The Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be
registered in a Demand Registration shall select the investment banking firm
or firms to manage the underwritten offering, provided that such selection
shall be subject to the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Holder may participate in any
registration pursuant to _Section 2.1.1_ unless such Holder (x) agrees to sell
such Holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting
arrangements described above and (y) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements; provided, however, that no such Holder shall be required to make
any representations or warranties in connection with any such registration
other than representations and warranties as to (i) such Holder's ownership of
his or its Registrable Securities to be transferred free and clear of all
liens, claims, and encumbrances, (ii) such Holder's power and authority to
effect such transfer, and (iii) such matters pertaining to compliance with
securities laws as may be reasonably requested; provided, further, however,
that the obligation of such Holder to indemnify pursuant to any such
underwriting arrangements shall be several, not joint and several, among such
Holders selling Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder
will be in proportion thereto, and provided, further, that such liability will
be limited to the net amount received by such Holder from the sale of his or
its Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.

  

  

 

4  

  

2.1.4 _Rights of Nonrequesting Holders_. Upon receipt of any Demand Request,
the Company shall promptly (but in any event within ten (10) days) give
written notice of such proposed Demand Registration to all other Holders, who
shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Company within
twenty (20) days of their receipt of the Company's notice, to elect to include
in such Demand Registration such portion of their Registrable Securities as
they may request. All Holders requesting to have their Registrable Securities
included in a Demand Registration in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall be deemed to be "Requesting Holders" for purposes of this _Section 2.1_.

  

2.1.5 _Priority on Demand Registrations_. No securities to be sold for the
account of any Person (including the Company) other than a Requesting Holder
shall be included in a Demand Registration unless the managing underwriter or
underwriters shall advise the Requesting Holders that the inclusion of such
securities will not adversely affect the price, timing or distribution of the
offering or otherwise adversely affect its success (an " _Adverse Effect_ ").
Furthermore, if the managing underwriter or underwriters shall advise the
Requesting Holders that, even after exclusion of all securities of other
Persons pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the amount of
Registrable Securities proposed to be included in such Demand Registration by
Requesting Holders is sufficiently large to cause an Adverse Effect, the
Registrable Securities of the Requesting Holders to be included in such Demand
Registration shall equal the number of shares which the Requesting Holders are
so advised can be sold in such offering without an Adverse Effect and such
shares shall be allocated pro rata among the Requesting Holders on the basis
of the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by each such Requesting Holder.

  

2.1.6 _Deferral of Filing_. The Company may defer the filing (but not the
preparation) of a registration statement required by _Section 2.1_ until a
date not later than sixty (60) days after the Required Filing Date and not
more than twice and not more than ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any
twelve-month period if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company or a
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
that such registration would be materially detrimental to the Company and its
stockholders; provided, that the Board of Directors of the Company or such
committee, as applicable, shall, in making such determination, take into
consideration the benefit to the Company of completing such registration and
the reduction of the ownership of Registrable Securities by the Requesting
Holder, or (ii) prior to receiving the Demand Request, the Company had
determined to effect a registered underwritten public offering of the
Company's securities for the Company's account and the Company had taken
substantial steps (including, but not limited to, selecting a managing
underwriter for such offering) and is proceeding with reasonable diligence to
effect such offering. A deferral of the filing of a registration statement
pursuant to this _Section 2.1.6_ shall be lifted, and the requested
registration statement shall be filed forthwith, if, in the case of a deferral
pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the negotiations or other
activities are disclosed or terminated, or, in the case of a deferral pursuant
to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the proposed registration for the
Company's account is abandoned. In order to defer the filing of a registration
statement pursuant to this _Section 2.1.6_ , the Company shall promptly (but
in any event within ten (10) days), upon determining to seek such deferral,
deliver to each Requesting Holder a certificate signed by an executive officer
of the Company stating that the Company is deferring such filing pursuant to
this _Section 2.1.6_ and a general statement of the reason for such deferral
and an approximation of the anticipated delay. Within twenty (20) days after
receiving such certificate, the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities held by the Requesting Holders and for which registration was
previously requested may withdraw such Demand Request by giving notice to the
Company; if withdrawn, the Demand Request shall be deemed not to have been
made for all purposes of this Agreement. The Company may defer the filing of a
particular registration statement pursuant to this _Section 2.1.6_ only once.

2.2

  |  

 _Piggyback Registrations_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

2.2.1 _Right to Piggyback_. Each time the Company proposes to register any of
its equity securities (other than pursuant to an Excluded Registration) under
the Securities Act for sale to the public (whether for the account of the
Company or the account of any securityholder of the Company) (a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "), the Company shall give prompt written notice to each Holder
of Registrable Securities (which notice shall be given not less than ten (10)
days prior to the anticipated filing date of the Company's registration
statement), which notice shall offer each such Holder the opportunity to
include any or all of its Registrable Securities in such registration
statement, subject to the limitations contained in _Section 2.2.2_ hereof.
Each Holder who desires to have its Registrable Securities included in such
registration statement shall so advise the Company in writing (stating the
number of shares desired to be registered) within ten (10) days after the date
of such notice from the Company. Any Holder shall have the right to withdraw
such Holder's request for inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in
any registration statement pursuant to this _Section 2.2.1_ by giving written
notice to the Company of such withdrawal. Subject to _Section 2.2.2_ below,
the Company shall include in such registration statement all such Registrable
Securities so requested to be included therein; provided, however, that the
Company may at any time withdraw or cease proceeding with any such
registration if it shall at the same time withdraw or cease proceeding with
the registration of all other equity securities originally proposed to be
registered.

  

2.2.2 _Priority on Piggyback Registrations_.

  

(a) If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten offering and was initiated
by the Company, and if the managing underwriter advises the Company that the
inclusion of Registrable Securities requested to be included in the
Registration Statement would cause an Adverse Effect, the Company shall
include in such registration statement (i) first, the securities the Company
proposes to sell, (ii) second, the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such registration, pro rata among the Holders of such Registrable
Securities on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities owned by each
such Holder, and (iii) third, any other securities requested to be included in
such registration, provided that if such other securities have been requested
to be included pursuant to a registration rights agreement, then such
securities would be included as set forth in (ii) above. If as a result of the
provisions of this _Section 2.2.2(a)_ any Holder shall not be entitled to
include all Registrable Securities in a registration that such Holder has
requested to be so included, such Holder may withdraw such Holder's request to
include Registrable Securities in such registration statement.

  

(b) If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten offering and was initiated
by a security holder of the Company, and if the managing underwriter advises
the Company that the inclusion of Registrable Securities requested to be
included in the Registration Statement would cause an Adverse Effect, the
Company shall include in such registration statement (i) first, the securities
requested to be included therein by the security holders requesting such
registration and the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration, pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of
the number of securities owned by each such holder, and (ii) second, any other
securities requested to be included in such registration (including securities
to be sold for the account of the Company).

  

  

 

6  

  

If as a result of the provisions of this _Section 2.2.2(b)_ any Holder shall
not be entitled to include all Registrable Securities in a registration that
such Holder has requested to be so included, such Holder may withdraw such
Holder's request to include Registrable Securities in such registration
statement.

  

(c) No Holder may participate in any registration statement in respect of a
Piggyback Registration hereunder unless such Holder (x) agrees to sell such
Holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting
arrangements approved by the Company and (y) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents, each in customary form, reasonably required under the terms
of such underwriting arrangements; provided, however, that no such Holder
shall be required to make any representations or warranties in connection with
any such registration other than representations and warranties as to (i) such
Holder's ownership of his or its Registrable Securities to be sold or
transferred free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances, (ii) such
Holder's power and authority to effect such transfer, and (iii) such matters
pertaining to compliance with securities laws as may be reasonably requested;
provided, further, however, that the obligation of such Holder to indemnify
pursuant to any such underwriting arrangements shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Holders selling Registrable Securities, and the liability
of each such Holder will be in proportion to, and provided, further, that such
liability will be limited to, the net amount received by such Holder from the
sale of his or its Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.

  

2.3 _SEC Form S-3_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Demand Registrations to be registered on Form S-3 (or any successor form) once
the Company becomes eligible to use Form S-3, and if the Company is not then
eligible under the Securities Act to use Form S-3, Demand Registrations shall
be registered on the form for which the Company then qualifies. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to become eligible to use Form S-3
(including if applicable an automatic shelf registration statement) and, after
becoming eligible to use Form S-3, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
remain so eligible.

  

2.4 _Holdback Agreements_.

  

(a) The Company shall not effect any public sale or distribution of its equity
securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for such securities, during the seven days prior to and during the 90-day
period beginning on the effective date of any registration statement in
connection with a Demand Registration (other than a Shelf Registration), or in
the case of a Shelf Registration, the filing of any prospectus relating to the
offer and sale of Registrable Securities, or a Piggyback Registration, except
pursuant to any registrations on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor form or
unless the underwriters managing any such public offering otherwise agree.

  

  

 

7  

  

(b) If any Holder of Registrable Securities notifies the Company in writing
that it intends to effect an underwritten sale registered pursuant to a Shelf
Registration pursuant to _Article 2_ hereof, the Company shall not effect any
public sale or distribution of its equity securities, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for its equity securities,
during the seven days prior to and during the 90-day period beginning on the
pricing date for such underwritten offering, except pursuant to registrations
on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor form or unless the underwriters
managing any such public offering otherwise agree.

  

(c) Each Holder agrees, in the event of an underwritten offering by the
Company (whether for the account of the Company or otherwise), not to offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any Registrable Securities, or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
securities, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act
(except as part of such underwritten offering), during the seven days prior
to, and during the 90-day period (or such lesser period as the lead or
managing underwriters may require) beginning on the effective date of the
registration statement for such underwritten offering (or, in the case of an
offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to
Rule 415, the pricing date for such underwritten offering).

  

2.5 _Registration Procedures_. Whenever any Holder has requested that any
Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and the sale
of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of
disposition thereof as promptly as is practicable, and pursuant thereto the
Company will as expeditiously as possible:

  

    | (i) |  

prepare and file with the SEC, pursuant to _Section 2.1.1(a)_ with respect to
any Demand Registration, a registration statement on any appropriate form
under the Securities Act with respect to such Registrable Securities and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective, provided that as far in advance as practicable before filing such
registration statement or any amendment thereto, the Company will furnish to
the selling Holders copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents
prepared to be filed (including exhibits), and any such Holder shall have the
opportunity to object to any information contained therein and the Company
will make corrections reasonably requested by such Holder with respect to such
information prior to filing any such registration statement or amendment;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (ii) |  

except in the case of a Shelf Registration, prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments, post-effective amendments, and supplements to such registration
statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary
to keep such registration statement effective for a period of not less than
one hundred eighty (180) days (or such lesser period as is necessary for the
underwriters in an underwritten offering to sell unsold allotments) and comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
all securities covered by such registration statement during such period in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set
forth in such registration statement;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

8  

  

    | (iii) |  

in the case of a Shelf Registration, prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration
statement effective (including the filing of a new registration statement upon
the expiration of a prior one) and to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities
subject thereto until the date on which all the Registrable Securities subject
thereto have been sold pursuant to such registration statement;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (iv) |  

furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities and the underwriters of the
securities being registered such number of copies of such registration
statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included in
such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus), any
prospectus supplement, any documents incorporated by reference therein and
such other documents as such seller or underwriters may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by
such seller or the sale of such securities by such underwriters (it being
understood that, subject to _Section 2.6_ and the requirements of the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, the Company consents to
the use of the prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each
seller and the underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement of which such
prospectus, amendment or supplement is a part);

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (v) |  

use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions
as the managing underwriter reasonably requests (or, in the event the
registration statement does not relate to an underwritten offering, as the
holders of a majority of such Registrable Securities may reasonably request);
use its reasonable best efforts to keep each such registration or
qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period in which
such registration statement is required to be kept effective; and do any and
all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable each seller to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such seller in such jurisdictions (provided, however, that the
Company will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
subparagraph or (B) consent to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction);

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (vi) |  

promptly notify each seller and each underwriter and (if requested by any such
Person) confirm such notice in writing (A) when a prospectus or any prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed and, with respect to a
registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has
become effective,

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

9  

  

    |  |  

(B) of the issuance by any state securities or other regulatory authority of
any order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of any
of the Registrable Securities under state securities or "blue sky" laws or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, and (C) of the happening of
any event which makes any statement made in a registration statement or
related prospectus untrue or which requires the making of any changes in such
registration statement, prospectus or documents so that they will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, prepare and file with
the SEC and furnish a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as
thereafter deliverable to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (vii) |  

permit any selling Holder which, in such Holder's sole and exclusive judgment,
might reasonably be deemed to be an underwriter or a controlling person of the
Company, to participate in the preparation of such registration or comparable
statement and to require the insertion therein of material, furnished to the
Company in writing, which in the reasonable judgment of such Holder and its
counsel should be included;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (viii) |  

make reasonably available members of management of the Company, as selected by
the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such
registration, for assistance in the selling effort relating to the Registrable
Securities covered by such registration, including, but not limited to, the
participation of such members of the Company's management in road show
presentations;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (ix) |  

otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and make generally
available to the Company's securityholders an earnings statement satisfying
the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act no later than thirty
(30) days after the end of the twelve (12) month period beginning with the
first day of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective
date of a registration statement, which earnings statement shall cover said
twelve (12) month period, and which requirement will be deemed to be satisfied
if the Company timely files complete and accurate information on Forms 10-Q,
10-K and 8-K under the Exchange Act and otherwise complies with Rule 158 under
the Securities Act;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (x) |  

if requested by the managing underwriter or any seller promptly incorporate in
a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the
managing underwriter or any seller reasonably requests to be included therein,
including, without limitation, with respect to the Registrable Securities
being sold by such seller, the purchase price being paid therefor by the
underwriters and with respect to any other terms of the underwritten offering
of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering, and promptly make
all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

10  

  

    | (xi) |  

as promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC of any document which is
incorporated by reference into a registration statement (in the form in which
it was incorporated), deliver a copy of each such document to each seller;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xii) |  

cooperate with the sellers and the managing underwriter to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates (which shall not bear any
restrictive legends unless required under applicable law) representing
securities sold under any registration statement, and enable such securities
to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing
underwriter or such sellers may request and keep available and make available
to the Company's transfer agent prior to the effectiveness of such
registration statement a supply of such certificates;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xiii) |  

promptly make available for inspection by any seller, any underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to any registration statement, and
any attorney, accountant or other agent or representative retained by any such
seller or underwriter (collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "), all financial and
other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company
(collectively, the " _Records_ "), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable
them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company's
officers, directors and employees to supply all information requested by any
such Inspector in connection with such registration statement; provided,
however, that, unless the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or
correct a misstatement or omission in the registration statement or the
release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from
a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be required to
provide any information under this subparagraph (xiii) if either (1) the
Company has requested and been granted from the SEC confidential treatment of
such information contained in any filing with the SEC or documents provided
supplementally or otherwise or (2) the Company reasonably determines in good
faith that such Records are otherwise confidential and so notifies the
Inspectors in writing, unless prior to furnishing any such information such
Holder of Registrable Securities requesting such information agrees to enter
into a confidentiality agreement in customary form and subject to customary
exceptions; and provided, further, that each Holder of Registrable Securities
agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought
in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the
Company, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action and to prevent
disclosure of the Records deemed confidential;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xiv) |  

furnish to each seller and underwriter a signed counterpart of (A) an opinion
or opinions of counsel to the Company, and (B) a comfort letter or comfort
letters from the Company's independent public accountants, each in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by opinions or
comfort letters, as the case may be, as the sellers or managing underwriter
reasonably requests;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

11  

  

    | (xv) |  

cause the Registrable Securities included in any registration statement to be
(A) listed on each securities exchange, if any, on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed or (B) quoted on any inter-dealer
quotation system if similar securities issued by the Company are quoted
thereon, and, in each case, to be registered under the Exchange Act;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xvi) |  

provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
registered hereunder;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xvii) |  

cooperate with each seller and each underwriter participating in the
disposition of such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in
connection with any filings required to be made with the FINRA;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xviii) |  

during the period when the prospectus is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, promptly file all documents required to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xix) |  

notify each seller of Registrable Securities promptly of any request by the
SEC for the amending or supplementing of such registration statement or
prospectus or for additional information;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xx) |  

enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements in the managing
underwriter's customary form) as are customary in connection with an
underwritten registration, with any representations, warranties and other
agreements contained therein for the benefit of the underwriters also being
for the benefit of the sellers of Registrable Securities;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xxi) |  

provide such information and cooperation in connection with any distribution,
listing or trading of any securities of a wholly owned, direct or indirect
Subsidiary of GE in connection with and subject to the requirements applicable
to a Permitted Spin Transaction (as defined in the Newco LLC Operating
Agreement) to the same extent that would be required for the direct
registration of Registrable Securities; and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (xxii) |  

advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it shall
receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order
by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use
its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to
obtain its withdrawal at the earliest possible moment if such stop order
should be issued.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

2.6 _Suspension of Dispositions_. Each Holder agrees by acquisition of any
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice (a " _Suspension
Notice_ ") from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in _Section 2.5(vi)(C)_ , such Holder will forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until such Holder's receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus, or until it is advised in
writing (the " _Advice_ ") by the Company that the use of the prospectus may
be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
which are incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by
the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice.

  

  

 

12  

  

In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the time period regarding
the effectiveness of registration statements set forth in _Sections 2.5(ii)_
and _2.5(iii)_ hereof shall be extended by the number of days during the
period from and including the date of the giving of the Suspension Notice to
and including the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by
such registration statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented
or amended prospectus or the Advice. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts and take such actions as are reasonably necessary to render the Advice
as promptly as practicable.

  

2.7 _Registration Expenses_. All reasonable, out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incident to any registration hereunder, including, without limitation, the
Company's performance of or compliance with this _Article 2_ , all
registration and filing fees, all fees and expenses associated with filings
required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("
_FINRA_ ") (including, if applicable, the reasonable fees and expenses of any
"qualified independent underwriter" as such term is defined in FINRA Rule
2720, and of its counsel), as may be required by the rules and regulations of
FINRA, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or "blue sky" laws
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with
"blue sky" qualifications of the Registrable Securities), rating agency fees,
printing expenses (including expenses of printing certificates for the
Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with the Depository
Trust Company and of printing prospectuses), messenger and delivery expenses,
the fees and expenses incurred in connection with any listing or quotation of
the Registrable Securities, fees and expenses of counsel for the Company and
its independent certified public accountants (including the expenses of any
special audit or "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such
performance), the fees and expenses of any special experts retained by the
Company in connection with such registration, and the fees and expenses of
other persons retained by the Company, will be borne by the Company (unless
paid by a security holder that is not a Holder for whose account the
registration is being effected) whether or not any registration statement
becomes effective; provided, however, that any underwriting discounts,
commissions, or fees attributable to the sale of the Registrable Securities
will be borne by the Holders pro rata on the basis of the number of shares so
registered and the fees and expenses of any counsel, accountants, or other
persons retained or employed by any Holder will be borne by such Holder.

  

2.8 _Indemnification_.

  

2.8.1 The Company agrees to indemnify and reimburse, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, each seller of Registrable Securities, and each of its
employees, advisors, agents, representatives, partners, officers, and
directors and each Person who controls such seller (within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act) and any agent or investment advisor
thereof (collectively, the " _Seller Affiliates_ ") (A) against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, joint or several
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements except as
limited by _Section 2.8.3_ ) based upon, arising out of, related to or
resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or preliminary prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading,

  

  

 

13  

  

(B) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage, and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in
settlement of any litigation or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, and (C)
against any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) as may be reasonably incurred in investigating,
preparing, or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding
by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, or such
violation of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, to the extent that any such
expense or cost is not paid under subparagraph (A) or (B) above; except
insofar as any such statements are made in reliance upon and in strict
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such seller
or any Seller Affiliate for use therein. The reimbursements required by this
_Section 2.8.1_ will be made by periodic payments during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred.

  

2.8.2 In connection with any registration statement in which a seller of
Registrable Securities is participating, each such seller will furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or
prospectus and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such seller will
indemnify the Company and each of its employees, advisors, agents,
representatives, partners, officers and directors and each Person who controls
the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) and
any agent or investment advisor thereof against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements except as limited by _Section 2.8.3_ )
resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus, or any preliminary
prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing
to the Company by such seller or any of its Seller Affiliates specifically for
inclusion in the registration statement; provided that the obligation to
indemnify will be several, not joint and several, among such sellers of
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such seller of Registrable
Securities will be in proportion to, and will be limited to, the net amount
received by such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such registration statement; provided, however, that such seller of
Registrable Securities shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
prior to the filing of any such registration statement or prospectus or
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, such seller has furnished in writing
to the Company information expressly for use in such registration statement or
prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto which corrected or
made not misleading information previously furnished to the Company.

  

  

 

14  

  

2.8.3 Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (A) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
limit the rights of such Person) and (B) unless in such indemnified party's
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that any person
entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person unless (X) the
indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (Y) the
indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person. If such defense is not
assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder, the indemnifying
party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the
indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be
unreasonably withheld). If such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party
pursuant to the provisions hereof, such indemnifying party shall not settle or
otherwise compromise the applicable claim unless (1) such settlement or
compromise contains a full and unconditional release of the indemnified party
or (2) the indemnified party otherwise consents in writing. An indemnifying
party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim
will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such
claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party, a conflict
of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which event the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such additional counsel or counsels.

  

2.8.4 Each party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the indemnification
provisions contemplated by _Section 2.8.1_ or _Section 2.8.2_ are unavailable
to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (or actions in respect
thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
losses, claims, liabilities, or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the actions
which resulted in the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
_Section 2.8.4_ were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders or
any underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose)
or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in this _Section 2.8.4_. The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or, except
as provided in _Section 2.8.3_ , defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 2.8.4_ , no Holder shall be
required to contribute an amount greater than the dollar amount by which the
net proceeds received by such Holder with respect to the sale of any
Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of damages which such Holder has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of any and all untrue or alleged
untrue statements of material fact or omissions or alleged omissions of
material fact made in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto related to such sale
of Registrable Securities.

  

  

 

15  

  

No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
Holders' obligations in this _Section 2.8.4_ to contribute shall be several in
proportion to the amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not
joint.

  

If indemnification is available under this _Section 2.8_ , the indemnifying
parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in
_Section 2.8.1_ and _Section 2.8.2_ without regard to the relative fault of
said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration provided for in this _Section 2.8.4_ subject, in the case of the
Holders, to the limited dollar amounts set forth in _Section 2.8.2_.

  

2.8.5 The indemnification and contribution provided for under this Agreement
will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director, or controlling
Person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of securities.

  

2.9 _Transfer of Registration Rights_. The rights of each Holder under this
Agreement may be assigned to any direct or indirect transferee of a Holder
permitted under the Stockholders Agreement who agrees in writing to be subject
to and bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

2.10 _Rule 144_. The Company will file the reports required to be filed by it
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such
reports, will, upon the request of the Holders, make publicly available other
information) and will take such further action as the Holders may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the Holders to
sell Class A Common Stock without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the Securities
Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time or (ii) any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the reasonable request of any
Holder, the Company will deliver to such parties a written statement as to
whether it has complied with such requirements and will, at its expense,
forthwith upon the request of any such Holder, deliver to such Holder a
certificate, signed by the Company's principal financial officer, stating (a)
the Company's name, address and telephone number (including area code), (b)
the Company's Internal Revenue Service identification number, (c) the
Company's SEC file number, (d) the number of shares of each class of capital
stock outstanding as shown by the most recent report or statement published by
the Company, and (e) whether the Company has filed the reports required to be
filed under the Exchange Act for a period of at least ninety (90) days prior
to the date of such certificate and in addition has filed the most recent
annual report required to be filed thereunder.

  

  

 

16  

  

2.11 _Preservation of Rights_. The Company will not (i) grant any registration
rights to third parties which are more favorable than or inconsistent with the
rights granted hereunder or (ii) enter into any agreement, take any action, or
permit any change to occur, with respect to its securities that violates or
subordinates the rights expressly granted to the Holders in this Agreement.

  

2.12 _Stockholders Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to permit a Transfer
(as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) by any Holder of Registrable
Securities that is prohibited by the terms of the Stockholders Agreement.

  

ARTICLE 3 
 TERMINATION

  

3.1 _Termination_. The Holders may exercise the registration rights granted
hereunder in such manner and proportions as they shall agree among themselves.
The registration rights hereunder shall cease to apply to any particular
Registrable Security when: (a) a registration statement with respect to the
sale of such Registrable Security shall have become effective under the
Securities Act and such Registrable Security shall have been disposed of in
accordance with such registration statement; (b) such Registrable Security
shall have been sold to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
Act (or any successor provision); (c) such Registrable Security shall have
been otherwise transferred, new certificates for them not bearing a legend
restricting further transfer shall have been delivered by the Company and
subsequent public distribution of them shall not require registration or
qualification of them under the Securities Act or any similar state law then
in force; (d) such Registrable Security shall have ceased to be outstanding,
(e) in the case of Registrable Securities held by a Holder that is not GE or
any Affiliate thereof, such Holder holds less than five percent (5%) of the
then outstanding Registrable Securities and such Registrable Securities are
eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any
successor provision) without restriction or (f) in the case of Registrable
Securities held by GE or any Affiliate thereof, such Holder holds less than
three percent (3%) of the then outstanding Registrable Securities and such
Registrable Securities are eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (or any successor provision) without restriction. The Company
shall promptly upon the request of any Holder furnish to such Holder evidence
of the number of Registrable Securities then outstanding.

  

ARTICLE 4

received on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to

invalidate the entire Agreement. Such provision shall be deemed to be modified
to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no

    | 2. |

_Certificate of Incorporation_ ") to the contrary, the holders of Common Stock
shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of
Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely

include, any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other
person or a sale, lease, exchange or conveyance of all or a part of its
assets. The holders of shares of Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be

shares of such series pursuant to a sinking fund or otherwise;

   
---|---|---

exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be
personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No repeal or modification of this

was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in

Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in _section (D)_ of this _Article VII_
, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in

---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (C) |  

 _Prepayment of Expenses_. The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not
prohibited by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in
defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay all
amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person
is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Article VII_ or otherwise.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (D) |  

 _Claims_. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of

Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may
file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense (including
attorney's fees) of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation
shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to
the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (E) |

Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, any agreement, or pursuant to
any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than
Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (H) |  

 _Priority of Corporation Obligations_. In the event that a Covered Person has
rights of indemnification or advancement of expenses from any Person (an "
_Other Indemnitor_ ") other than the Corporation or an Affiliate of the
Corporation in respect of a proceeding and also has rights of indemnification
or advancement of expenses from the Corporation under this _Article VII_ , the
Corporation shall be primarily liable for indemnification and advancement of
expenses to such Covered Person in respect of such proceeding and any
obligation of an Other Indemnitor to provide indemnification or advancement of
expenses shall be secondary to the obligations of the Corporation under this
_Article VII_. If any Other Indemnitor pays or causes to be paid, for any
reason, any amounts otherwise indemnifiable or subject to advancement under
this _Article VII_ , then (i) such Other Indemnitor shall be fully subrogated
to all rights of the Covered Person with respect to the payments actually made
and (ii) the Corporation shall reimburse such Other Indemnitor for the
payments actually made.

the fullest extent permitted by law.

  

ARTICLE XI 
 AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend,

and to the Stockholders Agreement, and subject to the rights of the holders of
any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to any Preferred Stock Designation, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision
of this Certificate of Incorporation, or to adopt any new provision of this

not have jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, or, if
such other court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
be the sole and exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the Corporation, (B) any action asserting a claim of
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (C) any

ARTICLE XIV 
 CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

  

    | (A) |  

 _General_. In recognition and anticipation (1) that the Corporation will not
be a wholly owned subsidiary of GE and that GE will be a significant
stockholder of the Corporation, (2) that directors, officers and/or employees
of GE may serve as directors and/or officers of the Corporation, (3) that,
subject to any contractual arrangements that may otherwise from time to time
be agreed to between GE and the Corporation including the Stockholders
Agreement, GE may engage in the same, similar or related lines of business as
those in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or
other business activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the
Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage, (4) that GE may have an
interest in the same areas of corporate opportunity as the Corporation and
Affiliated Companies thereof, and (5) that, as a consequence of the foregoing,
it is in the best interests of the Corporation that the respective rights and
duties of the Corporation and of GE, and the duties of any directors and/or
officers of the Corporation who are also directors, officers and/or employees
of GE, be determined and delineated in respect of any transactions between, or
opportunities that may be suitable for both, the Corporation and Affiliated
Companies thereof, on the one hand, and GE, on the other hand, the sections of
this _Article XIV_ shall to the fullest extent permitted by law regulate and
define the conduct of certain of the business and affairs of the Corporation
in relation to GE and the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation as
they may involve GE and its directors, officers and/or employees, and the
power, rights, duties and liabilities of the Corporation and its officers,
directors and stockholders in connection therewith. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any shares of
capital stock of the Corporation, or any interest therein, shall be deemed to
have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this _Article XIV_.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

11  

  

    | (B) |  

 _Certain Agreements and Transactions Permitted_. The Corporation has entered
into the Stockholders Agreement with GE, and, subject to the Stockholders
Agreement, may from time to time enter into and perform, and cause or permit
any Affiliated Company of the Corporation to enter into and perform, one or
more agreements (or modifications or supplements to pre-existing agreements)
with GE pursuant to which the Corporation or an Affiliated Company thereof, on
the one hand, and GE, on the other hand, agree to engage in transactions of
any kind or nature with each other and/or agree to compete, or to refrain from
competing or to limit or restrict their competition, with each other,
including to allocate and to cause their respective directors, officers and/or
employees (including any who are directors, officers and/or employees of both)
to allocate opportunities between or to refer opportunities to each other.
Subject to _section (D)_ of this _Article XIV_ , and except as otherwise
agreed in writing (including in the Stockholders Agreement), no such
agreement, or the performance thereof by the Corporation or any Affiliated
Company thereof, or GE, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
considered contrary to (1) any fiduciary duty that GE may owe to the
Corporation or any Affiliated Company thereof or to any stockholder or other
owner of an equity interest in the Corporation or an Affiliated Company
thereof by reason of GE being a controlling or significant stockholder of the
Corporation or of any Affiliated Company thereof or participating in the
control of the Corporation or of any Affiliated Company thereof or (2) any
fiduciary duty owed by any director and/or officer of the Corporation or any
Affiliated Company thereof who is also a director, officer and/or employee of
GE to the Corporation or such Affiliated Company, or to any stockholder
thereof. Subject to _section (D)_ of this _Article XIV_ , to the fullest
extent permitted by law, GE, as a stockholder of the Corporation or any
Affiliated Company thereof, or as a participant in control of the Corporation
or any Affiliated Company thereof, shall not have or be under any fiduciary
duty to refrain from entering into any agreement or participating in any
transaction referred to above, and no director and/or officer of the
Corporation who is also a director, officer and/or employee of GE shall have
or be under any fiduciary duty to the Corporation or any Affiliated Company
thereof to refrain from acting on behalf of the Corporation or any Affiliated
Company thereof or of GE in respect of any such agreement or transaction or
performing any such agreement in accordance with its terms.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (C) |  

 _Business Activities_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the
Corporation and GE, including in the Stockholders Agreement, and subject to
_section (D)_ of this _Article XIV_ , GE shall to the fullest extent permitted
by law have no duty to refrain from (1) engaging in the same or similar
activities or lines of business as the Corporation or (2) doing business with
any client, customer or vendor of the Corporation, and (except as provided in
_section (D)_ of this _Article XIV_ below) neither GE nor any officer,
director and/or employee thereof shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, be deemed to have breached its fiduciary duties, if any, to the
Corporation solely by reason of GE's engaging in any such activity.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

12  

  

    |  |  

Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation and GE, in the
event that GE acquires knowledge (other than through its position as a
stockholder of the Corporation or through any of its directors, officers or
employees that are also directors, officers or employees of the Corporation)
of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for
both the Corporation and GE, GE shall to the fullest extent permitted by law
have fully satisfied and fulfilled its fiduciary duty with respect to such
corporate opportunity, and the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by
law renounces any interest or expectancy in such business opportunity and
waives any claim that such business opportunity constituted a corporate
opportunity that should have been presented to the Corporation or any
Affiliated Company thereof, if GE acts in a manner consistent with the
following policy: if GE acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or
matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Corporation and GE,
such corporate opportunity shall belong to GE unless such opportunity was
expressly offered to GE in its capacity as a stockholder of the Corporation.
In the case of any corporate opportunity in which the Corporation has
renounced its interest and expectancy in the previous sentence, GE shall to
the fullest extent permitted by law not be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder of the
Corporation by reason of the fact that GE acquires or seeks such corporate
opportunity for itself, directs such corporate opportunity to another Person,
or otherwise does not communicate information regarding such corporate
opportunity to the Corporation.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | (D) |  

 _Corporate Opportunities_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the
Corporation and GE, in the event that a director and/or officer of the
Corporation who is also a director, officer and/or employee of GE acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate
opportunity for both the Corporation and GE, such director and/or officer
shall to the fullest extent permitted by law have fully satisfied and
fulfilled his or her fiduciary duty with respect to such corporate
opportunity, and the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law
renounces any interest or expectancy in such business opportunity and waives
any claim that such business opportunity constituted a corporate opportunity
that should have been presented to the Corporation or any Affiliated Company
thereof, if such director and/or officer acts in a manner consistent with the
following policy:

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | 1. |  

such a corporate opportunity offered to any person who is a director but not
an officer or employee of the Corporation and who is also a director, officer
and/or employee of GE shall belong to the Corporation only if such opportunity
is expressly offered to such person in his or her capacity as a director of
the Corporation and otherwise shall belong to GE; and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

    | 2. |  

such a corporate opportunity offered to any person who is an officer or
employee of the Corporation and also is a director, officer and/or employee of
GE shall belong to the Corporation unless such opportunity is expressly
offered to such person in his or her capacity as a director, officer and/or
employee of GE, in which case such opportunity shall belong to GE.

   
---|---|--- 
  

  

  

 

13  

  

    | (E) |  

 _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this _Article XIV_ , (1) "Affiliated
Company" in respect of the Corporation shall mean any entity controlled by the
Corporation, (2) "corporate opportunities" shall include, but not be limited
to, business opportunities that the Corporation is financially able to
undertake, which are, from their nature, in the line of the Corporation's
business, are of practical advantage to it and are ones in which the
Corporation, but for _sections (C)_ and _(D)_ of this _Article XIV_ , would
have an interest or a reasonable expectancy, and in which, by embracing the
opportunities, the self-interest of GE or its directors, officers and/or
employees will be brought into conflict with that of the Corporation, and (3)
"GE" shall mean General Electric Company and its Affiliates (other than the
Corporation and any entity that is controlled by the Corporation).

   
---|---|---

at the principal office of the Corporation. The Board may, in its sole
discretion, determine that a meeting shall not be held at any place, but may

transmission consented to (in a manner consistent with the DGCL) by the
stockholder to whom the notice is given. The notices of all meetings shall

before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,

reasonably accessible electronic network, _provided_ that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the

list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication,
then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the list shall
presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at

thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to

pursuant to this paragraph (A)(2) of Section 1.10, and (ii) such other
information as the Corporation may request. The foregoing notice requirements
of this paragraph (A) of this Section 1.10 shall be deemed satisfied by a
stockholder with respect to business (other than any purported nomination) if
the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his, her or its intention to
present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8
promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto and such
stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been
prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting.

  

  

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of
this Section 1.10 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors

Corporation.

  

  

(B) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be conducted
at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
special meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations

stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board or any
committee thereof, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or
(2) provided that the Board pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof has determined that
directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the
Corporation who (a) is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided
for in this Section 1.10 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation and
at the time of the special meeting, (b) is entitled to vote at the special
meeting and (c) complies with the notice procedures and conditions set forth
in this Section 1.10 (including the information requirements in paragraph
(A)(2) of Section 1.10) as to such nomination. For the avoidance of doubt,
clause (2) of the foregoing sentence of this paragraph (B) of Section 1.10
shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to propose nominations of
persons for election to the Board at a special meeting of stockholders at
which directors are to be elected. In the event the Corporation calls a
special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more
directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election
of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for
election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of
meeting, if a stockholder's notice meeting the requirements of paragraph
(A)(2) of this Section 1.10 shall be delivered to the Secretary of the
Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier
than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to
such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting and the tenth (10th)
day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date
of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected
at such meeting. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of a
special meeting as to which notice has been sent to stockholders, or any
public announcement with respect thereto, commence a new time period (or
extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described
above.

  

  

(C) _General_. (1) Except as otherwise expressly provided in any applicable
rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act, only such persons who
are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10
shall be eligible to be properly elected at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business
shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought
before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
1.10. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to
determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought
before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 (including whether the
stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or
proposal is made, solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not
so solicit, as the case may be, proxies or votes in support of such
stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's
representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(xi) of this Section 1.10) and
(b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in
compliance with this Section 1.10, to declare that such nomination shall be
disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, unless
otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative
of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business,
such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be
transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been
received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.10, to be
considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a
duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be
authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such stockholder, to act for such stockholder as
proxy at the annual or special meeting of stockholders and such person must
produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of
the writing or electronic transmission, at the annual or special meeting of
stockholders.

  

  

(2) For purposes of this Section 1.10, " _public announcement_ " shall include
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or other national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 1.10; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any
requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business
to be considered pursuant to this Section 1.10 (including paragraphs (A)(2)
and (B) hereof), and compliance with paragraphs (A)(2) and (B) of this Section
1.10 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or
submit other business (other than, as provided in the penultimate sentence of
(A)(2), business (other than nominations) brought properly under and in
compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto,
as it may be amended from time to time). Nothing in this Section 1.10 shall be
deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of
proposals or nominations in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule
14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock to elect directors if and to the extent provided for under
any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

  

 

10  

  

(D) _Action by Stockholders without Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by
the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken
at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of

2.13 _Meetings by Conference Communications Equipment_. Directors may
participate in meetings of the Board or any committee thereof by means of
conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all

such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

  

  

2.14 _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without a
meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent

the Board. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members
of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any
meeting of the committee. Subject to the provisions of the Stockholders
Agreement, in the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the
member or members of the committee present at any meeting and not disqualified
from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board who meets the requirements for
membership on the committee to act at the meeting in the place of any such
absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by
the DGCL and provided in the resolution of the Board, shall have and may
exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the
business and affairs of the Corporation and may authorize the seal of the
Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Each such
committee shall keep minutes and make such reports as the Board may from time

may make rules for the conduct of its business, but unless otherwise provided
by the committee or in such rules, its business shall be conducted as nearly

Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the
Stockholders Agreement, these Bylaws or the resolution of the Board
designating the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees,

committee.

2.16 _Compensation of Directors_. Directors may be paid such compensation for
their services and such reimbursement for expenses of attendance at meetings
as the Board may from time to time determine. No such payment shall preclude
any director from serving the Corporation or any of its parent or subsidiary
entities in any other capacity and receiving compensation for such service.

Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other
organization in which one or more of the Corporation's directors or officers
are directors or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or
voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof
that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because any such
director's or officer's vote is counted for such purpose if: (a) the material
facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or the
committee and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or
transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; (b)
the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest
and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the

specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (c) the
contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the Board, a committee thereof or the
stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board or of a committee that
authorizes the contract or transaction.

series thereof.

  

  

Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated

4.5 _Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any

not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required
by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the
date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be

that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for
making such determination.

  

 

18  

  

If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall
also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned
meeting.

  

  

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and
which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action.
If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders
for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  

  

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date
shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been
fixed by the Board, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled
to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior
action by the Board is required under the DGCL, shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to
be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or
agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's
registered office shall be by hand or certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior
action by the Board is required under the DGCL, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, a written waiver signed by
the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
person entitled to notice, whether before, at or after the time of the event
for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice required
to be given to such person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any
meeting need be specified in any such waiver. Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

  

  

5.4 _Voting of Securities_. Except as the Board may otherwise designate, the
Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer or the

appoint any person or persons to act as, proxy or attorney-in-fact for this
Corporation (with or without power of substitution), with respect to the
securities of any other entity which may be held by this Corporation.

remaining provisions of these Bylaws (including, without limitation, each
portion of any paragraph of these Bylaws containing any such provision held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of these
Bylaws (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of
these Bylaws containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect

ARTICLE VII 
  
  
 INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT

  

  

7.1 _Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a " _Covered Person_ ") who
was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in
any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a
person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or has or had agreed to become a director or
officer of the Corporation, or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.5, the Corporation shall
be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or
part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of
such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the
specific case by the Board.

  

  

7.2 _Prepayment of Expenses_. The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not
prohibited by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in
defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay all
amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person
is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII or otherwise.

  

 

21  

  

7.3 _Authorization of Indemnification_. Any indemnification under this Article
VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth under applicable law and is
otherwise consistent with applicable law. Such determination shall be made,
with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such
determination, (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) by a
committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors,
even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors, or if
such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or
(d) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to
former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority
to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however,
that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding set forth in Section 7.1 or in defense of any claim, issue or
matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including
attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection
therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.

  

  

7.4 _Good Faith Defined_. For purposes of any determination under Section 7.3,
a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to
have had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if
such person's action was based on good faith reliance on the records or books
of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information
supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another
enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel
for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given
or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent
certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with
reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term " _another
enterprise_ " as used in this Section 7.4 shall mean any other corporation or
any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The
provisions of this Section 7.4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit
in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL.

  

  

7.5 _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim for indemnification
(following the final disposition of such proceeding) or advancement of
expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within thirty (30) days
after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the
Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of
such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be
paid the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. In any
such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered
Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of
expenses under applicable law. It shall be a defense to any such action
brought to enforce a right to indemnification (but not in an action brought to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) that the claimant has not met
the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL (or other
applicable law) for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 7.3 nor
the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such
application or create a presumption that the claimant has not met any
applicable standard of conduct.

  

 

22  

  

7.6 _Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any agreement, or pursuant to
any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that,
subject to the last sentence of Section 7.1, indemnification of the persons
specified in Section 7.1 shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law.
The provisions of this Article VII shall not be deemed to preclude the
indemnification of or advancement of expenses to any person who is not
specified in Section 7.1 but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation
to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.

  

  

7.7 _Priority of Corporation Obligations_. In the event that a Covered Person
has rights of indemnification or advancement of expenses from any person (an "
_Other Indemnitor_ ") other than the Corporation or an affiliate of the
Corporation in respect of a proceeding and also has rights of indemnification
or advancement of expenses from the Corporation under this Article VII, the
Corporation shall be primarily liable for indemnification and advancement of
expenses to such Covered Person in respect of such proceeding and any
obligation of an Other Indemnitor to provide indemnification or advancement of
expenses shall be secondary to the obligations of the Corporation under this
Article VII. If any Other Indemnitor pays or causes to be paid, for any
reason, any amounts otherwise indemnifiable or subject to advancement under
this Article VII, then (i) such Other Indemnitor shall be fully subrogated to
all rights of the Covered Person with respect to the payments actually made
and (ii) the Corporation shall reimburse such Other Indemnitor for the
payments actually made.

  

  

7.8 _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the
obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the
provisions of this Article VII.

  

 

23  

  

7.9 _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Article VII: references to "
_the Corporation_ " shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation,
any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors,
officers, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VII with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have
with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued; references to " _fines_ " shall include any excise taxes assessed
on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to "
_serving at the request of the Corporation_ " shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a
person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed
to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner " _not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation_ " as referred to in this Article VII.

  

  

7.10 _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such person.

  

  

7.11 _Contract Rights_. The obligations of the Corporation under this Article
VII to indemnify, and advance expenses to, a Covered Person shall be
considered a contract between the Corporation and such person, and no
modification or repeal of any provision of this Article VII shall affect, to
the detriment of such person, such obligations of the Corporation in
connection with a claim based on any act or failure to act occurring before
such modification or repeal.

binding outline of the terms for certain Tax matters to be entered into
between the Parties after signing. It is intended that such terms shall be
incorporated into a definitive agreement signed by the parties. Additional
terms and conditions may also be agreed upon in the definitive agreement. Any
definitive agreement remains subject to internal corporate approval by each
party. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meaning set forth in the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger
by and between GE and BHI (the " _Transaction Agreement_ ").

  


 

     

 _Agreement Name:_

  |  

Tax Matters Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ")

   
---|--- 
    

 _Parties:_

   
    

GE

  |  

General Electric Company, a New York corporation (" _GE_ ").

   
    

Newco

  |  

Bear Newco, Inc., a Delaware corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(" _Newco_ ").

   
    

Newco LLC

  |  

Newco LLC

   
    

 _Date:_

  |  

Closing Date

   
    

 _General Purpose_ :

  |  

* GE, Newco and Newco LLC desire to provide for and agree upon the allocation between the parties of Tax liabilities and benefits arising prior to, as a result of, and subsequent to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement and any restructuring transactions in connection therewith, and to provide for and agree upon other matters relating to Taxes.

   
    

 _Structure Tax Benefit Sharing:_

   
    

Formation Taxes

  |  

* GE will bear 100% of any net Formation Taxes (irrespective of whether the Transactions are consummated).

  

  

o " _Formation Taxes_ " shall mean any Taxes imposed with respect to any
Formation Transaction to the extent that such Tax would not have been imposed
if GE had transferred all of GE OandG to Newco in exchange for stock of Newco
(and BHI's shareholders were treated as contributing their BHI shares to Newco
in exchange for stock of Newco) in a transaction qualifying under Section 351
of the Code, including any Taxes arising by reason of (A) the acceleration or
triggering of deferred intercompany transactions and excess loss accounts
under Treas. Reg. §§ 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-19, respectively, (B) prepaid
expenses, (C) deferred revenue, (D) the acceleration of adjustments under
Section 481 of the Code and (E) any other items that are accelerated by reason
of any Formation Transaction or for which the income or gain has economically
accrued prior to the Closing and for which an item of income or gain is
recognized by reason of the formation of Newco LLC. For the avoidance of
doubt, Formation Taxes shall not be included in Newco LLC Pre-Closing Taxes
(defined below).

   
   

  

  

 

1  

  

      |  

  

o " _Formation Transactions_ " shall mean (i) any transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreement, and (ii) any restructuring transactions in
furtherance thereof that are undertaken by BHI and its Subsidiaries or by GE
and its Subsidiaries, including the GE Reorganization. For the avoidance of
doubt, a GE Exchange shall not be treated as a Formation Transaction.

  

  

o GE and Newco will negotiate in good faith to determine whether a Formation
Transaction undertaken by GE resulted in Formation Taxes, and GE will (i)
provide Newco with all information reasonably requested for the purpose of
making this determination and (ii) deliver a certification by the chief
financial officer of GE to the effect that a Formation Transaction undertaken
by GE did, or did not, result in Formation Taxes and the amount thereof.

  

  

* Between the date of the Transaction Agreement and until the Closing, GE and BHI shall mitigate, to the extent possible, any Formation Taxes. Such cooperation shall include (i) BHI and GE providing any information with respect to Formation Transactions reasonably requested by the other party and (ii) GE and BHI jointly determining any Formation Transactions to be undertaken by BHI and its Subsidiaries; provided that, in the event that GE and BHI disagree on any Formation Transaction, GE shall make such determination in its reasonable discretion (for this purpose, any position supported by substantial authority shall be considered reasonable).

  

  

* Any refunds of Formation Taxes borne by GE shall inure to the benefit of GE (without duplication of any Structure Benefits received by GE).

   
---|--- 
    

Structure Benefits - Sharing

  |  

* The parties shall share Structure Benefits (defined below) as follows:

  

  

o To the extent of Formation Taxes borne by GE, 100% to GE; and

  

  

o Thereafter, to be shared by Newco and GE based on the percentage of the
Newco LLC interests owned directly by Newco and GE, respectively, at the time
of such allocation (the " _Sharing Allocation_ "). The initial Sharing
Allocation shall be: (i) GE - 62.5% and (ii) Newco - 37.5%.

   
    

Structure Benefits - Defined

  | * " _Structure Benefits_ " shall mean:  
   

  

    

  

      |  

  

o Any Tax benefits actually realized by GE and/or Newco attributable to Tax
items, including Tax basis, deductions, losses or credits created and Taxes
paid resulting from transactions giving rise to Formation Taxes (including
correlative items that are attributable to amounts included in the calculation
of Formation Taxes); and

  

  

o Any Tax benefits actually realized by a Member attributable to (i) a loss,
deduction or credit allocated to such Member to the extent that such loss,
deduction or credit could not have been used by Newco LLC on a stand-alone
basis, determined as if Newco LLC were classified as a corporation (instead of
a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) a loss (including
a loss associated with a liability described in Treas. Reg. §1.752-7)
allocated to such Member or a gain allocated to the other Member, in each case
pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Code, to the extent such allocation of loss
or gain was disproportionate relative to the applicable Sharing Percentage
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding depreciation or amortization
allocated pursuant to Section 704(c), which is addressed below).

  

  

* For purposes of determining whether any such Tax benefits were actually realized by GE or Newco, as the case may be, such Tax benefits shall be computed annually on a "with and without basis" and payment (or credit or other offset in lieu of a payment) in respect thereof shall be made annually.

  

  

* To the extent that (i) GE does not receive a pro rata distribution from Newco LLC pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(ii) of the Newco LLC Operating Agreement (such shortfall, the " _Tax Distribution Shortfall_ "), and (ii) GE is required to share a Structure Benefit with Newco, such Structure Benefit shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Tax Distribution Shortfall unless and until the Tax Distribution Shortfall is paid to GE.

  

  

* If subsequent to the computation and payment (or credit or other offset in lieu of a payment) of a Structure Benefit, it is determined that the amount of such Structure Benefit is different than the amount previously determined, either in the taxable year in which the Structure Benefit arose (e.g., by reason of an audit adjustment) or in another taxable year, then upon such determination, GE, Newco and/or Newco LLC shall make such payments as are necessary to ensure that the net economic position of GE and Newco after such payments is the same as it would have been had the originally determined Structure Benefit been equal to the subsequently-determined Structure Benefit (" _Rebalancing Payments_ ").

   
---|--- 
    

Section 704(c) Methods

  |  

* Newco LLC shall select methods under Section 704(c) of the Code, initially and with respect to subsequent occasions for Section 704(c) method selection, in such a manner that is projected to produce (taking into account the result of prior Section 704(c) method selections), to the extent reasonably possible, an annual allocation of depreciation and amortization of Section 704(c) items based on the applicable Sharing Allocation.

   
   

  

    

  

     

 _General Tax Sharing:_

   
--- 
    

Pre-Closing Taxes

  |  

* Newco LLC will be responsible for (i) any pre-closing Taxes of BHI and its Subsidiaries other than any Formation Taxes and (ii) any pre-closing Taxes of GE OandG, whether imposed on GE and its Subsidiaries or Newco LLC and its Subsidiaries, other than (x) GE Income Taxes and (y) GE Formation Taxes (" _Newco LLC Pre-Closing Taxes_ ").

  

  

* In addition to GE's liability for Formation Taxes as set forth above (without duplication), GE will be responsible for, and indemnify Newco, Newco LLC and the Subsidiaries of each against (i) any Taxes imposed with respect to any Formation Transactions undertaken by GE (" _GE Formation Taxes_ "); and (ii) any Tax with respect to a pre-closing period that is, in whole or in part, based upon, related to or measured by income or gains, and any business franchise or similar Tax, in each case of any GE Holdco LLC or any GE OandG Subsidiary or that are related to GE OandG, whether imposed on GE and its Subsidiaries or Newco LLC and its Subsidiaries, including any Taxes that any GE Holdco LLC or a GE OandG Subsidiary is liable for as a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, including any liability imposed under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar state, local or foreign Law (" _GE Income Taxes_ ").

  

  

* Any refunds or credits of such Taxes borne by any party shall inure to the benefit of such party.

  

  

* In the event that Newco carries forward a BHI Tax attribute from a pre-closing Tax period and such attribute reduces Newco's Tax liabilities with respect to a post-closing Tax period, GE shall be entitled to share in a percentage of such reduction in Newco's Tax liabilities equal to GE's sharing percentage in the applicable Sharing Allocation.

   
    

Post-Closing Taxes

  |  

* To the extent that GE or its Subsidiaries are required to file an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group Tax return that includes Newco LLC or its subsidiaries, Newco LLC shall pay an amount to GE equal to the amount of Taxes that would be payable if Newco LLC and the relevant Subsidiaries filed a separate Tax return. Any adjustments resulting from an audit or proceeding, will be calculated and payable in the same manner. To the extent that a separate Tax return of Newco LLC and its Subsidiaries would reflect a net operating loss and such loss reduces the amount of Tax payable with respect to a group Tax return filed by GE or its Subsidiaries, GE shall reimburse Newco LLC for the amount equal to such reduction in Tax liability of the applicable GE group by reason of the use of such net operating loss, which shall be computed on a "with or without basis."

   
     |  

* To the extent that filing a Tax return on an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group basis is optional, GE shall determine whether Newco LLC or its Subsidiaries shall be included. If so included, the principles set forth above shall apply.

   
   

    

  

     

 _Tax Receivable Sharing:_

   
--- 
    

Exchanges by GE

  |  

* GE and Newco agree to treat an exchange by GE of Newco LLC Units (and Class B stock of Newco) for Class A common stock as a Taxable sale of GE's LLC Units to Newco for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "GE Exchange").

  

  

* Newco LLC will have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code for all Taxable years.

  

  

* As a result of any GE Exchange, GE shall be entitled to payments equal to 50% of the Tax benefit that will be realized by Newco from the step-up in basis and any other attributes resulting from such GE Exchange, which shall be calculated on a "with and without basis" (" _TRS Payments_ ").

  

  

* Upon a material breach by Newco with respect to its obligation to make TRS Payments, TRS Payments shall be accelerated and paid to GE based on certain assumptions, including sufficient annual taxable income to use any Tax benefit that will be realized by Newco resulting from a GE Exchange and an appropriate discount rate.

  

  

* In the event of a change of control of Newco, all TRS Payments following such change of control shall be mutually determined by GE and Newco acting in good faith based on Newco's projected standalone taxable income, which shall be calculated at the time of such change of control based on Newco's standalone activities, balance sheet, tax attributes and other characteristics, in each case, immediately before such change of control.

   
    

 _Payment Mechanics:_

   
    

General

  |  

GE and Newco shall cooperate in good faith to determine the manner in which
payments shall be made pursuant to this Agreement in order to minimize Taxes
imposed with respect to such payments, including by causing payments to be
made to or by Newco LLC. Each payment made hereunder shall be "grossed up" to
take into account any Taxes imposed thereon such that party economically
entitled to the payment receives, on an after-tax basis, the amount it would
have received if the payment had not been taxable.

  

   
   

  

    

  

     

 _Covenants:_

   
--- 
    

GE Reorganization

  |  

BHI and GE shall negotiate in good faith to agree on customary representations
and covenants provided to GE by Newco LLC that directly relate to facts or
actions within Newco LLC's control and that could adversely impact, in the
reasonable judgment of GE, the intended tax treatment of any material
Formation Transaction undertaken by GE; provided that BHI shall not be
required to agree to any such representation or covenant of Newco LLC if and
to the extent that compliance with such representation or covenant, as the
case may be, would reasonably be expected to (A) impose a material restriction
on the business operations of Newco LLC and its Subsidiaries or (B) result in
any material liabilities for Newco LLC and its Subsidiaries; and provided
further that Newco LLC shall not be treated as breaching any such
representation or covenant during any period during which GE (or a transferee
of GE) owns 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding Newco
stock.

   
    

 _Confidentiality_ :

  |  

The Agreement shall contain commercially reasonable obligations pertaining to
the protection and dissemination of confidential information that are
customary for an agreement of this nature.

   
    

 _Governing Law_ :

  |  

New York.

   
    

 _Miscellaneous_ :

  |  

The Agreement shall contain commercially reasonable miscellaneous
interpretative and procedural provisions that are customary for an agreement
of this nature.
