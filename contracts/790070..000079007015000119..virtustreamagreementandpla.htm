(ii) From and after the Effective Time, each such share of Company Stock
converted pursuant to Sections 3.1(b)(i), 3.1(b)(iii) and 3.1(c) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except, (1) if such share is described
in Section 3.1(b)(i), the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
to be paid in consideration therefor (taking into account any applicable
portion of Stockholder Debt as provided in Section 3.1(e)) upon surrender of
such certificates in accordance with Section 3.7, without interest, (2) if
such share of Company Stock is described in Section 3.1(b)(iii) or Section
3.1(c), the right to receive the consideration set forth in such sections, as
applicable, upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 3.7
or (3) if such share of Company Stock is a Dissenting Share, the right, if
any, to receive payment as determined in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, in each case, subject to the applicable portion of the
Escrow Amount and Representative Fund (as set forth in the Final
Securityholder Schedule).



(iii) Nonvested Option Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action so that, as of the
Effective Time, each share 

of Nonvested Option Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) will be assumed by Parent
immediately after the Effective Time and automatically converted into that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Converted Nonvested Option
Stock"), rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Nonvested Option Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the holders of such Nonvested
Option Stock prior to such conversion shall be entitled to receive the
Converted Nonvested Option Stock attributable to their Nonvested Option Stock
upon the surrender of any certificate representing such share in accordance
with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein. The Converted
Nonvested Option Stock shall be subject to the same vesting, forfeiture and
repurchase provisions as the Nonvested Option Stock from which it was
converted.



(c) Nonvested Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
take all necessary and appropriate action so that, as of the Effective Time,
each share of Nonvested Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Common Consideration
payable to the holder thereof, without interest ("Nonvested Cash"), and the
holders of such Nonvested Stock prior to such conversion shall be entitled to
receive the Nonvested Cash into which their Nonvested Stock was converted upon
the surrender of any certificate representing such share in accordance with
the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein; provided, however, that
the payment of Nonvested Cash shall be subject to the same vesting schedule
and shall only be paid upon the lapse of the forfeiture and repurchase
provisions applicable to the Nonvested Stock to which Nonvested Cash is
attributable, as set forth in the Final Securityholder Schedule (and shall be
forfeited if the applicable conditions are not attained; in the event of such
forfeiture the Company shall refund to the holder any amount actually paid in
cash or deducted pursuant to Section 3.1(e) from amounts that would otherwise
have been paid to such holder pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) in respect of the
original purchase of such Nonvested Stock). Unless Nonvested Cash is
forfeited, Nonvested Cash shall be paid by the Payments Administrator on
behalf of Parent promptly following the date that such Nonvested Cash becomes
vested. If applicable, all payments of Nonvested Cash shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes. No Nonvested Cash, or right thereto, may be
pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by
operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by
any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any liabilities of such
Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Nonvested Cash in
accordance with this Agreement.



(d) Cancellation. Each share of Company Stock owned by the Company as treasury
stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to exist and
be cancelled without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution of
any consideration shall be made with respect thereto. Each share of Company
Stock owned by any Company Subsidiary shall remain outstanding and shall not
be cancelled or converted into Merger Consideration.



(e) Stockholder Debt. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
3.1, the payment of consideration to a Company Stockholder under this
Agreement shall be offset by the amount of any Stockholder Debt owed to the
Company by such Company Stockholder. For the avoidance of doubt, references in
this Agreement to the Pro Rata Portion of any Company Securityholder shall be
inclusive of any Stockholder Debt of such Company Securityholder, including
with respect to such Indemnifying Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Amount and the Representative Fund.



3.2 Dissenting Holders.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
eligible under the 

DGCL to exercise appraisal or dissenters' rights and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of, or provided written consent to, the Agreement and the
Merger and who has exercised and perfected appraisal or dissenters' rights for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the consideration for Company Stock set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i),
and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights
as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section 262 of the DGCL.



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.2(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal and dissenters' rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares in accordance with Section 3.7, the
consideration for such shares set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i), without
interest, subject to the applicable portion of the Escrow Amount and the
Representative Fund with respect to such shares.



(c) The Company shall (i) comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL, (ii) give Parent prompt notice of any written demand received by the
Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and of withdrawals of such
demands, and provide copies of any documents or instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company and (iii) give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not make any payment
or settlement offer with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have
consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer.



(d) Any amount paid by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any
Person with respect to Dissenting Shares in excess of the amount that would
otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) for each such Dissenting
Share (such amount, unless determined in a final, non‑appealable judgment of a
court, being subject to the written approval of the Stockholder
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), and all interest, costs, expenses and fees incurred by the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the exercise
of all rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shall constitute "Damages" for
purposes of this Agreement, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall, without limiting any other rights, be entitled to
indemnification for such Damages as set forth in SECTION 15 hereof.



3.3 Company Options.



(a) Vested Options.



(i) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action so that a
blackout period in connection with the exercise of Company Options is
effective beginning on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing Date.



(ii) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action so that each
Vested Option shall, immediately following the Effective Time, be terminated
and converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, a cash amount equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option and (B) the
excess of the Per Share Common Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option (the "Vested Option
Payment"), which amount shall be subject to applicable Tax withholding. 

(iii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall or shall direct its payroll agent to, in
accordance with its customary payroll practices, pay to each holder of a
Vested Option the Vested Option Payment payable in respect of each such Vested
Option, but without interest; provided that, such payment shall not be made
any earlier than seven (7) days after the Effective Time.



(b) Unvested Option Conversion. The Company shall take all necessary and
appropriate action so that each Unvested Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be assumed by Parent immediately after the
Effective Time and automatically converted into an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions (including vesting provisions) as were applicable
under such Unvested Option as granted or issued by the Company (except as
provided below), the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), rounded down to the nearest whole
share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
equal to the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Unvested Option divided by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The assumption described
in this Section 3.3(b) shall be effected in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code, as applicable, and Section 409A of
the Code.



3.4 Warrants. Each Warrant shall, at the Effective Time, be terminated in
exchange for payment of (x) the Warrant Closing Payment, less such Warrant's
Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount and the Representative Fund (as set
forth in the Final Securityholder Schedule) plus (y) the applicable portion of
the Escrow Amount and the Representative Fund deducted from such Warrant
Closing Payment, if and when payable, subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. In accordance with the terms of this Agreement the Warrant Closing
Payments shall be paid to the holders of the Warrants (the "Warrant Holders").



3.5 Escrow. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Stockholders, shall deliver or cause to be delivered cash in an
amount equal to the Escrow Amount plus the Representative Fund to SunTrust
Bank, a Georgia banking corporation as depository agent for use by Acquiom
Clearinghouse LLC, as escrow administrator (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant to
the provisions of the escrow agreement in the form attached as Exhibit E
hereto, subject to any amendments to such form requested by the Escrow Agent
and mutually agreed to by Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the
Company (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Agreement shall be entered into
at the Closing, by and among Parent, the Stockholder Representative, on behalf
of the Indemnifying Stockholders and the Escrow Agent, and shall provide
Parent with recourse against amounts held in escrow by the Escrow Agent
(excluding, in all instances, however, the Representative Fund) with respect
to the Indemnifying Stockholders' indemnification obligations under SECTION
15, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement and
in SECTION 15 of this Agreement (the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Amount (or any
portion thereof) shall be distributed to the Indemnifying Stockholders and
Parent at the times, and upon the terms and conditions, set forth in the
Escrow Agreement. The terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are specific terms of the Merger, and the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the
Indemnifying Stockholders, the Stockholder Written Consents and the Joinder
Agreements shall constitute approval by such Indemnifying Stockholders, as
specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of such
Indemnifying Stockholders to be bound by and comply with, the Escrow Agreement
and all of the arrangements and provisions of this Agreement relating thereto,
including, the deposit of the Escrow Amount into escrow, the indemnification
obligations set forth in SECTION 15 hereof and the appointment and sole
authority to act on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders of the Stockholder
Representative, as provided for herein and in the Escrow Agreement. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to the
contrary, for Tax purposes, the parties intend that the Escrow Amount shall be
treated as eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the
Code (and any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
law).



3.6 Representative Fund. Immediately following the Effective Time, cash in an
amount equal to the Representative Fund shall be delivered by Parent, on
behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders, to the depository agent to be held
and distributed pursuant to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Representative Fund shall be a portion of the
aggregate consideration to be received by the Indemnifying Stockholders
pursuant to the Merger. The Representative Fund shall be used by the
Stockholder Representative solely for payment of out-of-pocket expenses, in
each instance incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with
the performance of the Stockholder Representative's duties and obligations
hereunder and pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Representative Fund shall
be available to the Stockholder Representative in addition to any amounts paid
to the Stockholder Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in no event shall (i) any Parent Indemnified Party have any rights in
or to the Representative Fund or (ii) the Company (following the Closing),
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation have any obligation or incur
any expense with respect to the Representative Fund or pay or otherwise be
liable for any amounts owed to or incurred by the Stockholder Representative.
None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall have any
responsibility or liability for the manner in which the Stockholder
Representative uses the amount reserved for the Representative Fund. For Tax
purposes, the Representative Fund shall be treated as having been received and
then set aside by the Indemnifying Stockholders immediately following the
Effective Time; provided, however, that to the extent practicable, any
withholding in respect of the Representative Fund shall be satisfied from
other sources owing to the Indemnifying Stockholders at the Effective Time.
The Representative Fund, if any, shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent on
behalf of the Stockholder Representative to the Indemnifying Stockholders at
the time, and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement.
Parent or Merger Sub shall have no obligation with respect to the distribution
of any remaining amount of the Representative Fund.



3.7 Surrender of Certificates.



(a) Payments Administrator.



(i) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with SunTrust Bank, a Georgia banking corporation as
depository agent for use by Acquiom Clearinghouse LLC, as payments
administrator (the "Payments Administrator"), for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Nonvested Option Stock),
holders of Company Preferred Stock, and the Warrant Holders, cash in an amount
equal to the aggregate amount of all Total Stock Closing Payments plus the
aggregate amount of all Warrant Closing Payments plus the aggregate amount of
all Nonvested Cash. Such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent pending
payment thereof by the Payments Administrator to the Company Stockholders,
provided that, such investment shall be limited to a demand deposit account or
a Federated Treasury Obligation Fund with the depository agent. Earnings from
such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of the Company Securityholders.



(ii) Prior to the Effective Time and in accordance with the requirements of
the Payments Administrator, the parties hereto agree that the Company will
deliver a revised version of the Final Securityholder Schedule to the Payments
Administrator to facilitate the payment of the Total Stock Closing Payments to
the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of Company Preferred
Stock, and the Warrant Closing Payments to the Warrant Holders, and the 

Nonvested Cash payment to the former holders of Nonvested Stock, as the case
may be (the "Payments Schedule").



(b) Surrender Procedures.



(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but no later
than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall instruct the Payments
Administrator to deliver to each Company Stockholder as of the Effective Time
(i) the Company Stockholder Letter of Transmittal and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of certificate(s) representing all of the
shares of Company Stock held by such Company Stockholder. The payment to a
Company Stockholder of the Stock Closing Payment (less the applicable portion
of Stockholder Debt of the Company Stockholder to be netted therefrom) with
respect to each share of Company Stock underlying each such certificate is
conditioned upon (A) the execution and delivery of the Company Stockholder
Letter of Transmittal and (B) the delivery of such certificates related
thereto (the "Required Documentation"). The issuance of Converted Nonvested
Option Stock to holders of Nonvested Option Stock in accordance with Section
3.1(b)(iii) and the issuance of Nonvested Cash to holders of Nonvested Stock
in accordance with Section 3.1(c) is conditioned upon the delivery to the
Payments Administrator of any certificates representing shares of Nonvested
Option Stock and Nonvested Stock, as applicable. As soon as practicable after
receipt by the Payments Administrator, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days following receipt, of certificate(s), properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and cancellation, together with such
duly completed and validly executed Company Stockholder Letter of Transmittal,
the Payments Administrator shall, in exchange therefor, pay to such Company
Stockholder the Stock Closing Payment (less the applicable portion of
Stockholder Debt of such Company Stockholder to be netted therefrom) payable
in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by the
certificate(s) surrendered (which payment, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include any payment in respect of shares of Nonvested Option Stock and
shares of Nonvested Stock represented by such surrendered certificates, which
stock shall be converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(iii) and Section 3.1(c),
as applicable), but without interest and less any applicable withholding
Taxes, and the certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled
(including with respect to all shares of Nonvested Option Stock assumed by
Parent and converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(iii) and all shares of
Nonvested Stock converted pursuant to Section 3.1(c) represented by such
certificates); provided, that the Payments Administrator shall pay the Stock
Closing Payments (less the applicable portion of Stockholder Debt of such
Company Stockholder to be netted therefrom) within one (1) Business Day
following the Closing Date to each Company Stockholder that provides the
Required Documentation with respect to such Company Stockholder's Company
Securities at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing, but only in the
event the Payments Administrator is provided (1) the name, address, email
address, stock certificate numbers and share amounts at least seven (7) days
prior to the Closing, (2) the Payments Schedule at least one (1) day prior to
the Closing and the amounts deliverable to the Payments Administrator pursuant
to Section 3.7(a)(i) are received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing
Date. If payment of any portion of the applicable Stock Closing Payment (less
the applicable portion of Stockholder Debt of such Company Stockholder to be
netted therefrom) is to be made to an individual, firm, entity, partnership,
association or any business organization or division thereof (each a "Person")
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person requesting such
payment (x) shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the registered holder of
the certificate(s) surrendered, and shall have established to the satisfaction
of Parent that such Tax has been paid, or (y) shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not applicable. From and
after the Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.7(b), each certificate formerly representing shares of Company Stock shall
be deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable consideration as provided pursuant to Sections 3.1(b)(i),
3.1(b)(iii) 

and 3.1(c), if any, in respect of such shares of Company Stock formerly
represented thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner
provided herein or Dissenting Shares as provided in Section 3.2.



(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but no later
than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall instruct the Payments
Administrator to deliver to each Warrant Holder a payment election form and
any applicable Tax forms. As soon as practicable after receipt by the Payments
Administrator of a completed executed payment election form and any applicable
Tax forms from such Warrant Holder, the Payments Administrator shall, in
exchange therefor, pay to such Warrant Holder the Warrant Closing Payment
payable in respect of the Warrant(s) held by the Warrant Holder prior to the
Effective Time, but without interest and less any applicable withholding
Taxes. If payment of any portion of the applicable Warrant Closing Payment is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the terminated
Warrant(s) are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person
requesting such payment (x) shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Warrant(s) terminated, and shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid, or (y) shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not applicable.
From and after the Effective Time, until terminated, each Warrant shall be
deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable
consideration as provided pursuant to Section 3.4.



(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares
of Company Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares
of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. After the Effective
Time, the Payments Administrator shall cancel and exchange, as provided in
this SECTION 3, any presented certificate representing shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(d) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payments
Administrator shall be liable to any holder of a certificate formerly
representing shares of Company Stock or a warrant for shares of Company Stock
for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.



(e) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Payments Administrator shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from payment of the Total Stock Closing Payment or the Warrant
Closing Payment or any other amounts (or any portion thereof) payable pursuant
to this Agreement to, or on behalf of, any Company Securityholder, and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of any
amounts (or any portion thereof) otherwise payable pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement to any Company Securityholder, such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any other Tax Law. In addition, the aforementioned right to deduct and
withhold Taxes shall be permitted with respect to Taxes required to be
withheld in respect of the vesting of Vested Stock and Vested Option Stock to
the extent the Company has not previously withheld and deposited such Taxes at
the time of vesting. If Parent or the Payments Administrator determines that
withholding is required on any payments to a Company Securityholder made with
respect to Company Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b), Parent or the Payments
Administrator, as applicable, shall notify and consult with the Stockholder
Representative prior to making such withholding. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Payments Administrator or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and, to the extent so
remitted, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the 

Company Securityholder to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
The Company shall cause each Company Securityholder, to the extent it, he or
she is legally entitled to do so, to deliver to Parent all forms prescribed by
applicable Legal Requirements necessary to reduce or eliminate any withholding
Tax obligation in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement



(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any certificate(s)
which formerly represented shares of Company Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact
by the Company Stockholder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
Parent shall instruct the Payments Administrator to pay such Company
Stockholder the applicable Stock Closing Payment (less the applicable portion
of Stockholder Debt of such Company Stockholder to be netted therefrom) or
Parent shall issue the Converted Nonvested Option Stock or cause to be paid
the Nonvested Cash to such Company Stockholder, as applicable, as provided in
this SECTION 3; provided, however, that Parent or the Payments Administrator
may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to issuing any such
instruction to the Payments Administrator or making any issuance of Converted
Nonvested Option Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in a customary form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payments Administrator with respect
to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(g) Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 3.7 shall also apply to
Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations
of Parent under this Section 3.7 shall commence on the date of loss of such
status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for such shares the applicable amounts provided in this SECTION 3.



3.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Parent
determines any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are hereby authorized in the name of
the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such
action.

the Closing Date, with respect to all current and former participants in such

most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit

SECTION 7

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



7.1 Information Statement.



(a) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement by the Company, the
Company shall duly take all lawful action to obtain the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Promptly following the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall deliver evidence of such approval to Parent.



(b) As expeditiously as possible following the date hereof, the Company shall
(i) complete the preparation of an information statement accurately describing
this Agreement, the Merger and the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Information Statement"), (ii) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Information Statement, and (iii) thereafter deliver
the Information Statement to those Company Stockholders that did not execute
the Stockholder Written Consent for the purpose of informing them of the
approval of the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 228 of the DGCL and their rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that the
information furnished in any document mailed, delivered or otherwise furnished
to the Company Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of their
consent to, and adoption of, this Agreement and the approval of the principal
terms of the Merger, including the statements in the Information Statement,
will not contain, at or prior to the Effective Time, any untrue statement of a
material fact and will not omit to state any material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify the holders of
Company Stock and Company Options of the transactions contemplated hereby, to
the extent required by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
Organizational Documents, the Company Plans, any Legal Requirements (including
the DGCL) or other agreements or instruments governing such securities and as
contemplated herein.



7.2 Confidentiality; Access to Information.



(a) Confidentiality. The Company and the Stockholder Representative shall, and
the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause each Company Securityholder
that has executed and delivered the Stockholder Written Consent, the Joinder
Agreement or a Warrant Termination Instrument, and each of their respective
legal, financial, accounting and other representatives to, (i) treat and hold
any Confidential Information as confidential and (ii) refrain from disclosing
all Confidential Information to any third party (other than their legal,
financial, accounting or other representatives that have a need to know and
who are subject to a confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party or the
Stockholder Representative). In the event that such Company Securityholder or
the Stockholder Representative is requested or required to disclose any
Confidential Information in connection with an Action, such Company
Securityholder or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, will notify
Parent promptly of the request or requirement so that Parent may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 7.2(a). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, such Company Securityholder or the Stockholder
Representative is legally required to disclose any Confidential Information,
such Company Securityholder or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable,
may disclose the Confidential Information to the extent so required (but only
to the extent so required); provided, however, that such Company
Securityholder or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, shall permit,
to the maximum extent possible, Parent to seek, prior to any such disclosure,
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
the 

Confidential Information required to be disclosed. Such Company Securityholder
and the Stockholder Representative will cooperate with Parent in seeking such
treatment at Parent's expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Company
Securityholders and the Stockholder Representative, and their respective
legal, financial, accounting or other representatives, may use and/or disclose
that portion of Confidential Information included as part of subsection (b) of
the definition thereof (a) as and to the extent disclosure is required by such
Person to his, her or its Tax or financial advisors for purposes of complying
with such Person's Tax obligations or other reporting obligations under Legal
Requirements arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) to his,
her or its legal counsel or accountants, (c) to the extent disclosure is made
by such Person that is an investment fund to its current or prospective
partners, members or stockholders, and is limited to the results of such
Person's investment in the Company and such other information as is required
to be disclosed by such Person pursuant to its partnership agreement, limited
liability company agreement or comparable organizational agreement, subject in
each of the foregoing cases set forth in subsections (a) through (c) to a duty
or agreement of confidentiality, and (d) to the Stockholder Representative. In
addition, the Stockholder Representative is permitted to share Confidential
Information with the Company Securityholders and its employees, advisors or
consultants (in each case who have a need to know such information), provided
that such persons either (A) agree to observe the terms of this Section 7.2(a)
or (B) are bound by obligations of confidentiality to the Stockholder
Representative of at least as high a standard as those imposed on the
Stockholder Representative under this Section 7.2(a). The Company is permitted
to share Confidential Information included as part of subsection (a) of the
definition thereof of the sort typically disclosed in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices and provided that the Company obtains
obligations of confidentiality with respect thereto from the recipient of any
such information prior to disclosure. Upon the termination of this Agreement,
the Company's obligations with respect to Confidential Information included as
part of subsection (a) of the definition thereof shall terminate.



(b) Access to Information. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
afford Parent and Parent's Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to its premises, properties, books, records, financial, Tax and
accounting records (including, the work papers of the Company's independent
accountants following its execution of a customary access letter), Contracts,
personnel, counsel, financial advisors and auditors during the Pre-Closing
Period to obtain all information concerning its business, including the status
of product development efforts, properties, results of operations, and
personnel for purposes of this Agreement, as Parent may reasonably request;
provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the
extent that in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) any applicable Legal Requirements or Contract requires the Company to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information or would
reasonably be expected to violate or compromise any attorney-client privilege
of the Company or a Company Subsidiary. In addition, any information obtained
from the Company pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 7.2(b)
shall constitute "Confidential Information" under the Non-Disclosure Agreement
between Parent and the Company, dated May 1, 2015 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").



(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall afford the Stockholder Representative and its accountants and legal
counsel, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business
hours to make inspection of the pre-Closing books and records of the Surviving
Corporation (subject to the execution of any customary access letters) to
allow the Stockholder Representative and its accountants and legal counsel to
obtain information in the Surviving Corporation's possession to the extent
reasonably necessary to enable the Stockholder Representative to perform its
duties under this Agreement or to comply with applicable Legal Requirements;
provided, however, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with legal counsel) any applicable Legal Requirements or Contract
requires Parent or the Surviving Corporation to restrict or prohibit access to
any such books or records or would reasonably be expected to violate or
compromise any attorney-client privilege of Parent, 

the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Any information obtained by the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section
7.2(c) shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(a).



(d) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and that
information provided by the Company to Parent, or by Parent to the Company,
pursuant to this Agreement prior to the Closing shall be treated in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms. If the Closing occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate effective as of the Closing.



7.3 Public Disclosure. No press release or any public disclosure, either
written or oral, of the transactions contemplated hereby or negotiations
related thereto shall be made by the Company, any Company Securityholder, the
Stockholder Representative or any of the Company's Representatives, without
the express prior written consent of Parent, provided that, Company
Securityholders may publicly disclose information that has previously been
disclosed to the public by Parent. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reasonably consult with the Company
prior to making any press release or any public disclosure, either written or
oral, of the transactions contemplated hereby or negotiations related thereto.



7.4 Regulatory Filings; Exchange of Information; Notification; Reasonable
Efforts.



(a) Regulatory Filings. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use all reasonable
efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action that
would impede compliance with, all applicable Legal Requirements, and as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall obtain or make all Consents with, any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated

Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue
sky" laws and the securities laws of any foreign country, or any other
applicable Legal Requirements relating to the Merger. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing
with any Governmental Authority under this Section 7.4(a) to comply in all
material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate to determine if requesting early
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any
applicable Foreign Merger Laws is appropriate.



(b) Exchange of Information. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall
(and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to) promptly supply the
other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate or
obtain any filings or other actions pursuant to Section 7.4(a). Except where
prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the
confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 7.2(a), the Confidentiality
Agreement and any joint defense agreement entered into between the parties
hereto or their counsel, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall (and
shall cause each of their respective affiliates to) (i) consult with the
others prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing or other
actions, (ii) to the extent reasonably required to permit appropriate
coordination of efforts, permit the others to review and discuss in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the others in connection with, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions and proposals before making or 

submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Authority in connection
with any Action in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) coordinate with the others in preparing and
exchanging such information, (iv) promptly provide the others (and their
counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a
summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (v) promptly provide the others (and their counsel) with advance
notice of, and an opportunity to attend and participate in (to the extent

contemplated hereby.



(c) Notification. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the
others promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any Governmental
Authority in connection with any filings or other actions made pursuant hereto
and (ii) any request by any Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to any filings or other actions made pursuant to any Legal
Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing or other action made pursuant to Section
7.4(a), Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly
inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Authority such amendment or supplement.



(d) Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, during the Pre-Closing Period, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using all
reasonable efforts to (i) cause the conditions precedent set forth in SECTION
8, SECTION 9 and SECTION 10 to be satisfied; (ii) avoid any Action by any
Governmental Authority; (iii) obtain all Consents or waivers from third
parties, including all applicable Consents under the Contracts (provided that,
the parties will discuss in good faith procedures to pursue third party
Consents with respect to the Merger, it being understood that the Company
shall not make, or offer to make, or be required to make, any payment or other
commitment in connection with obtaining any such Consent without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); (iv) defend any Actions challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (v) execute or
deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement,
including obtaining executed Joinder Agreements from each Company Stockholder.
In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the
Company Board shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that no state
takeover law or similar Legal Requirements are or become applicable to the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and, if
any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirements are or becomes applicable
to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of any such Legal Requirements on the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take, or agree to
take, any Action of Divestiture.



7.5 Advise of Changes. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and the Company
shall promptly advise the other party in writing to the extent it has
knowledge of (a) any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected
to result in the failure by it (and, in the case of Parent, by Merger Sub) to
comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement prior to or at the 

Effective Time, (b) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (c) with respect to the Company
only, any Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that no such
notification will be deemed to prevent or cure any breach of, or inaccuracy
in, amend or supplement any Section of the Disclosure Schedule, or otherwise
disclose an exception to, or affect in any manner, the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties or the
Indemnifying Stockholders under this Agreement.



7.6 Cooperation. Subject to compliance with applicable Legal Requirements,
during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall periodically confer with one
or more Representatives of Parent to report operational matters that are
material and the general status of ongoing operations, in each case with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall continue to operate its business and make business
decisions independently of Parent during the Pre-Closing Period.



7.7 Notice to Warrant Holders. The Company shall notify the Warrant Holders of
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall use reasonable efforts to cause
each Warrant Holder to execute and deliver a warrant termination instrument (a
"Warrant Termination Instrument") prior to the Closing. Such notices and
Warrant Termination Instruments shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.



7.8 Company Plans.



(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company
Plans listed on Section 7.8 of the Disclosure Schedule contingent upon and
effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, including taking any
necessary action by the Company Board to effectuate the termination of the
Company's 401(k) plan, such termination to be effective as of the date
immediately prior to the Closing; provided that, the Company shall provide
Parent for its review and comment advance copies of communications with the
Employees relating to such termination, which review and comment shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.



(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall: (i) deliver to Parent its
calculation of Potential 280G Benefits and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the waiver of such Potential 280G Benefits by the recipient
and (iii) if applicable, seek approval, as described in Section 280G(b)(5) of
the Code and Regulations §1.280G-1 thereunder, with respect to the
reinstatement of such Potential 280G Benefits if the payment or provision of
such payments or benefits would reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition of any excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code; provided,
that the Company shall provide Parent for its review and comment advance
copies of its calculations and communications by which it intends to seek such
waiver and to seek requisite approval, which review and comment shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.



(c) For the twelve (12) month period immediately following the Closing Date,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the current Employees who are
employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (1)
employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date or (2) substantially the
same employee benefits in the aggregate as those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent. From the Closing Date until December 31, 2015,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Employees who are employed by
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time base salaries and
cash incentive compensation opportunities that are at least equal to those
provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided,
that in no event shall this sentence limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to make reductions to the base salaries or cash incentive
compensation 

opportunities of such Employees in connection with an across-the board
reduction of compensation applied to all similarly situated employees of
Parent and/or one of its Subsidiaries. With respect to each benefit plan,
program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent in which current
Employees subsequently participate, for purposes of determining eligibility,
vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and
vacation entitlement, service with the Company or a Company Subsidiary (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Parent; provided that, such service shall not
be recognized for purpose of accruals of benefits or to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that
such service was not recognized under the applicable Company Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted or construed to confer upon any Employee any right with respect to
continuance of employment by or other service with the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, nor shall this Agreement interfere in any
way with the right of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent to terminate or change any Employee's or Service Provider's employment
or other association, compensation or benefits at any time, or require the

(c) any amount of Company Transaction Expenses, except to the extent that such

(f) any amount paid by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any

(h) any (i) Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any
Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for the portion of any
Straddle Period ending at the close of business on the Closing Date
(determined as provided in Section 16.1) other than (A) as a result of any
actions taken or elections made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their

omissions of the Stockholder Representative, including any claim for fraud or
misrepresentation, breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty,

or in the Escrow Agreement.



15.2 Remedy; Essential Terms.



(a) Except for indemnification in respect of Parent Claims related to the
Unlimited Claims, the aggregate amount of indemnification available to the
Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement shall be restricted to the
amount of the Escrow Fund, which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent in respect of such Parent Claims; provided, however, that the aggregate
amount of indemnification available to the Parent Indemnified Parties under
this Agreement, the Joinder Agreements and the Stockholder Written Consents in
respect of Parent Claims related to Section 4.19 (Intellectual Property) shall
be limited to $200,000,000 (which amount will include any amounts paid to the
Parent Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Amount if such amounts are solely
in respect of Parent Claims related to Section 4.19). The liability of the
Indemnifying Stockholders for indemnification hereunder shall be (x) joint and
several to the extent of the Escrow Amount, and (y) thereafter, with respect
to the Indemnifying Stockholders only, shall be several but not joint up to
each Indemnifying Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of any indemnifiable Damage
(which Pro Rata Portion in respect of this clause (y) shall, for the avoidance
of doubt, be calculated in accordance with subsection (b) of the definition of
Pro Rata Portion set forth in this Agreement). Except for indemnification in
respect of Parent Claims related to fraud, willful misrepresentation or
intentional breach by an Indemnifying Stockholder, such Indemnifying
Stockholder shall not be individually liable hereunder (and pursuant to any
indemnification provided for in his, her or its Joinder Agreement and/or
Stockholder Written Consent) for more than the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration or Warrant Closing Payment, as applicable, actually received by
such Indemnifying Stockholder (including amounts deemed to have been received
by such Indemnifying Stockholder from the Escrow Fund and the Representative
Fund, if any, and any Stockholder Debt deducted from amounts that would have
been paid to any Company Stockholder but for such Stockholder Debt under
Section 3.1(e)). During the Escrow Period, the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall seek recovery first from the Escrow Fund for any Parent Claim. Following
the Escrow Period, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall seek recovery from the
Participating Holders for any Parent Claim that is an Unlimited Claim in
accordance with the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations of
this SECTION 15. Any indemnification provided for in Section 7 of an
Indemnifying Stockholder's Joinder Agreement, other than indemnification with
respect such Indemnifying Stockholder's obligations under Section 15.1, shall
be several and not joint, and no other Indemnifying Stockholder shall have any
Liability for any breach. The limitation provided in Section 15.1(b) shall not
apply to any claim for indemnification with respect to an Indemnifying
Stockholder's obligations under Section 7 of such Indemnifying Stockholder's
Joinder Agreement to the extent such indemnification is in respect of claims
for breaches of representations and warranties of the Indemnifying Stockholder
set forth in such Joinder Agreement or breaches of any obligations set forth
in such Joinder Agreement, other than indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Stockholder under Section 15.1.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this SECTION 15 to the contrary, the Parent
Indemnified Parties may not recover Damages in respect of any Parent Claim
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds $500,000
(the "Basket"), after which, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to recover all Damages (including the amount of the Basket); provided,
however, that any Parent Claim that is an Unlimited Claim shall not be subject
to the Basket.



(c) Nothing in this Section 15.2 shall limit any remedy Parent may have
against any Person for fraud, willful misrepresentation or intentional breach
by such Person. 

(d) The terms and conditions of this SECTION 15 constitute essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Merger, and approval of this Agreement by
the Company Securityholders shall constitute the express agreement of each
Indemnifying Stockholder with respect to the obligations of Indemnifying
Stockholders pursuant to this SECTION 15.



(e) The amount of Damages recoverable by a Parent Indemnified Party under this
SECTION 15 shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by any amounts
actually recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in procuring such recovery) by the Parent Indemnified
Parties under third-party insurance policies (but for the avoidance of doubt,
not self-insurance policies or policies issued by fronting insurance
companies) or other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any
Person which are contained outside of this Agreement ) with respect to such
Damages; provided, that the amount actually recovered under insurance policies
or other collateral sources shall be net of costs of collection resulting from
making a claim thereunder.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Securityholders make no
representations or warranties in respect of the existence, amount or usability
of the net operating losses, capital loss carry forwards, foreign tax credit
carry forwards, research and development credits, assets bases and
depreciation periods of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in taxable
periods, or portions thereof, beginning after the Closing Date. In addition,
the Company Securityholders shall not be liable with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary attributable to Tax periods beginning after
the Closing Date with respect to breaches of representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.13(a), 4.13(b), 4.13(c), 4.13(d), 4.13(e), 4.13(i),
4.13(m), the first sentence of 4.13(o), 4.13(p), 4.13(s), 4.13(t), 4.13(u)
(other than to the extent the breach of such representation results in the
requirement of Parent, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to repay or
remit a Tax benefit received by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing Date), or 4.13(v).



(g) Except as expressly provided for herein, Parent acknowledges and agrees,
on behalf of itself and the other Parent Indemnified Parties, that, should the
Closing occur, its and their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and
all claims arising under or based upon this Agreement and any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith (including any Company
Stockholder Letter of Transmittal, but specifically excluding any of the
Employment Agreements, the Escrow Agreement, any Joinder Agreements and any
Warrant Termination Instruments), shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this SECTION 15.



(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, absent fraud,
willful misrepresentation or intentional breach, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
shall give rise to any right on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the Merger, to rescind this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(i) Any Damages for which any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this SECTION 15 shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Damage
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant.
No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement for any Damage arising from a breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant set forth herein (and the amount of any Damage incurred in respect
of such breach shall not be included in the calculation of any limitations on
indemnification set forth herein) to the extent such Damage was already
reflected in the calculation of the Closing Total Equity Consideration. 

15.3 Notification of Claims. If a Parent Indemnified Party has determined in
good faith that any Parent Claim has occurred or is reasonably likely to
occur, an authorized officer or representative of such Parent Indemnified
Party, as applicable, may so notify the Stockholder Representative. Each such
notice shall be in writing and shall describe with reasonable specificity, and
to the extent known by the applicable Parent Indemnified Party, the nature and
amount of such Parent Claim.



15.4 Third Party Actions. In the event any Action is instituted by any third
party against a Parent Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably
likely to involve a Parent Claim for which indemnification may be sought,
Parent will, promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the
Stockholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Stockholder, such Indemnifying
Stockholder) of the commencement thereof (a "Third-Party Action"). The failure
to so notify the Stockholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification
is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Stockholder, such
Indemnifying Stockholder) of the commencement of any such Third-Party Action
will not relieve the Indemnifying Stockholders from liability in connection
therewith, except to the extent that such failure materially and adversely
affects the ability of the Indemnifying Stockholders to defend their interests
in such Third- Party Action. Except with respect to Third-Party Actions
related to Taxes ("Tax Actions"), the Stockholder Representative shall have
the right in its sole discretion to assume and control the defense or
settlement of such Third-Party Action if (x) the remedies sought with respect
to such Third-Party Action are limited solely to monetary damages and (y) the
aggregate amount of monetary damages recoverable in the Third Party Action are
reasonably anticipated at the time of the Stockholder Representative's
assumption of the defense of such Third-Party Action to be less than then
remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund; provided that, Parent and its counsel
(at Parent's sole expense) may participate in (but not control the conduct of)
the defense of such Third-Party Action; provided further that, except with the
consent of Parent, (1) the Stockholder Representative shall not settle any
such Third-Party Action and (2) no settlement of any such Third-Party Action
shall be determinative of the amount of Damages with respect to a Parent Claim
relating to such Third-Party Action. In the event that Parent has consented to
any such settlement, Parent will not be entitled to make any claim under
SECTION 15 for any additional amount of Damages against the Escrow Fund, or
against the Indemnifying Stockholders directly, as the case may be, with
respect to any such amounts paid in settlement of such Third-Party Action. For
all Third-Party Actions other than as described in the foregoing sentence,
including Tax Actions, Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
assume and control the defense or settlement of such Action; provided that,
the Stockholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being
sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Stockholder, such Indemnifying
Stockholder) and its counsel (at such party's sole expense) may participate in
(but not control the conduct of ) the defense of such Third-Party Action;
provided further that, except with the reasonable consent of the Stockholder
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Stockholder, such Indemnifying Stockholder), no
settlement of any such Third-Party Action shall be determinative of the amount
of Damages with respect to a Parent Claim relating to such matter. In the
event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such
settlement, the Indemnifying Stockholders shall have no power or authority to
object under any provision of this SECTION 15 to the amount of any such Parent
Claim against the Escrow Fund, or against the Indemnifying Stockholders
directly, as the case may be, with respect to such settlement.



15.5 Definition of Damages. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Damages"
shall mean the amount of any loss, claim, Tax, demand, compensatory damage,
deficiency, lost profits, liability, judgment, royalty, fine, penalty,
diminution in value, cost or expense (including costs of investigation and
reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees and expenses and
interest and penalties awarded or imposed by a Governmental Authority)
incurred, paid, accrued or sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties,
including any costs (including costs of investigation and reasonable 

attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees and expenses) of defending any
Actions or enforcing the Parent Indemnified Party's rights under this
Agreement.



15.6 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The Company Securityholders, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent agree to treat and report (and cause
their Affiliates to treat and report) any payments received pursuant to this
SECTION 15 as adjustments to the Total Equity Consideration for all Tax
purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Legal Requirements. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Total Equity Consideration will be treated as having
been paid in full to the Company Securityholders immediately following the
Effective Time, and any payments from the Escrow Fund to Parent will be
treated as a refund of the excess amount paid by Parent over the reduced Total
Equity Consideration.



15.7 Investigation; No Company Recourse.



(a) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company or the Stockholder
Representative in this Agreement, or any document, certificate or other
instrument required to be delivered by the Company or Stockholder
Representative under this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted by any Parent Indemnified Party of any other Person at any time, or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any Parent
Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Effective Time, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.



(b) An Indemnifying Stockholder shall have no right of contribution or other
recourse against Parent Indemnified Parties, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, assigns or
successors, for any indemnification claims asserted by any Parent Indemnified
Parties, it being acknowledged and agreed that the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company are solely for the benefit
of the Parent Indemnified Parties.



SECTION 16

TAXES



16.1 Pre-Closing Tax Period; Straddle Period.



(a) All Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date and any Straddle Period, to the
extent filed or required to be filed after the Closing Date, shall be prepared
and filed by Parent. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with
the past practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except as
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements or as could not adversely
affect the Company Stockholders. In the event any Tax Return reflects any
amount for which the Indemnifying Stockholders could be liable under the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement, such Tax Return, if due
(including any extensions of time to file) more than thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date, shall be submitted to the Stockholder Representative for the
Stockholder Representative's review and comment (which comment shall be
considered by Parent in good faith).



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, after
consultation with the Stockholder Representative, Parent may file or cause to
be filed any FBAR Reports required to be filed with respect to the Company and
each Company Subsidiary for any period.



(c) Neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall make or change any Tax
election, adopt or change any accounting method, file or amend any Tax Return,
initiate discussions with 

Taxing authorities, participate in voluntary disclosure agreements, or take
any other action if such election, adoption, change, amendment, discussion,
participation or action could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability that the Indemnifying Stockholders are required
to indemnify under this Agreement, unless, in any case, Parent has first
consulted with the Stockholder Representative regarding such election,
adoption, change, amendment, discussion, participation or action, and has
given the Stockholder Representative reasonable opportunity to participate in
connection therewith.



(d) The Company and each Company Subsidiary will, unless prohibited by
applicable Tax Law, close its taxable period as of the close of business on
the Closing Date. If applicable Tax Law does not permit the Company or a
Company Subsidiary to close its taxable year on the Closing Date, or in any
case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable period which
includes the Closing Date (but does not end on that day) (a "Straddle
Period"), the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be
allocated (a) to the Company Stockholders for the period up to and including
the close of business on the Closing Date and (b) to the Parent for the period
subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or deductions
required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be
made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary as of the close of the Closing Date; provided that,
exemptions, allowances, deductions or periodic Taxes (such as property or
similar ad valorem Taxes) that are calculated on an annual or other periodic
basis (including, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period ending after the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period.



16.2 Transfer Taxes. Any sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp, duties, recording
and similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne 50% by Parent
and 50% by the Company Stockholders. Parent shall prepare and file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes
(the "Transfer Tax Returns") and timely remit all such Transfer Taxes;
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent may seek indemnification
with respect to the Transfer Taxes for which the Company Stockholders are
liable pursuant to the preceding sentence. If required by applicable Tax Law,
the Company Stockholders or the Stockholder Representative will join in the
execution of any Transfer Tax Return.



16.3 Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Parent, on
the one hand, and the Indemnifying Stockholders or the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to the
provisions of this Agreement that relate to Taxes that cannot be resolved by
negotiations between Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall be
submitted to the Boston office of BDO USA, LLP (or if BDO USA, LLP cannot or
will not serve, such other nationally recognized firm reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Stockholder Representative, the "Accounting Firm") for
resolution. The Accounting Firm shall control the proceedings related to the
dispute resolution and may request such evidence and information as it deems
necessary. The Accounting Firm shall promptly determine (it being understood
that in making such determination, the Accounting Firm shall be functioning as
an expert and not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by
Parent and the Stockholder Representative, and not by independent review, only
those issues in dispute and shall render a written report as to the resolution
of the dispute and the resulting computation of any Tax, fee, deduction or
other amount in dispute which, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive and
binding on Parent, the Stockholder Representative, the Indemnifying
Stockholders and their respective Affiliates. In resolving any disputed item,
the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such items claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such items claimed by either party. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Parent and
the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders,
based on the 

inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Firm's determination (before
such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in
dispute total an amount equal to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in
favor of the Stockholder Representative's position, 60% of the costs of its
review would be borne by Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders.



SECTION 17

STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE



17.1 Powers of the Stockholder Representative.



(a) The Stockholder Representative shall have and may exercise all of the

relating to any Action before a court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction, which notice must be given to each Indemnifying Stockholder
individually, as applicable), and to take any and all action for and on behalf
of the Indemnifying Stockholders, and each of them, under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any other such agreement, document or instrument;



(iii) The power (subject to the provisions of Section 17.2 hereof) to (A)

hereby by arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and (E) take or forego any or

the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;



(iv) The power to consult with, engage and rely on legal counsel, independent
public accountants and other experts selected by him, her or it, solely at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Stockholders;



(v) The power to review, negotiate and agree to and authorize any payments
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any payment obligation, in each case,
on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders, as contemplated thereunder;



(vi) The power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Indemnifying Stockholders
(other than the

pursuant to SECTION 3 of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms hereof
and in the manner provided herein; and



(vii) The power to take any actions on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders
in regard to such other matters as are reasonably necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or as the Stockholder
Representative reasonably believes are in the best interests of the
Indemnifying Stockholders.



(b) The Stockholder Representative represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that:



(i) The Stockholder Representative has all necessary power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to carry out
his, her or its obligations hereunder and thereunder;



(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder
Representative and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of the Stockholder Representative, enforceable
against the Stockholder Representative in accordance with its terms, subject
to Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions; and



(iii) At or prior to the Closing, the Escrow Agreement will be duly executed
and delivered by the Stockholder Representative and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement by Parent and
the Escrow Agent, constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the
Stockholder Representative, enforceable against the Stockholder Representative
in accordance with its terms, subject to Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.



17.2 Claims by Parent.



(a) Upon receipt or notice of any Parent Claim pursuant to Sections 15.3 or
15.4, the Stockholder Representative shall give prompt notice of the amount
and details thereof (to the extent of the information in his, her or its
possession) to the Indemnifying Stockholders.



(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have the discretion to take such
action as he, she or it shall determine to be in the best interest of all of
the Indemnifying Stockholders, taken as a whole, including authorizing the
distribution to any Parent Indemnified Party of any portion of the Escrow
Fund; provided, however, that, in any event, all Indemnifying Stockholders are
treated in substantially the same manner with respect to amounts to be paid
from the Escrow Fund.



17.3 Notices. Any notice given to the Stockholder Representative will
constitute notice to each and all of the Indemnifying Stockholders at the time
notice is given to the Stockholder Representative. Any action taken by, or
notice or instruction received from, the Stockholder Representative will be
deemed to be action by, or notice or instruction from, each and all of the
Indemnifying Stockholders. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation may, and the Escrow Agent will, disregard any notice or
instruction received from any one or more individual Indemnifying
Stockholders.



17.4 Agreement of the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder
Representative hereby agrees to do such acts, and execute further documents,
as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. 

17.5 Reimbursement and Liability of Stockholder Representative.



(a) Each Indemnifying Stockholder agrees to reimburse the Stockholder
Representative for such Indemnifying Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative
in the performance of his, her or its duties hereunder. Each Indemnifying
Stockholder agrees that such Indemnifying Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of
such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses may be distributed to the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders, from the
Representative Fund and, to the extent the Representative Fund is exhausted,
from the Escrow Fund, if any portion is remaining prior to the final release
of the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Stockholders. The Representative Fund
shall be held by the Escrow Agent for reimbursements payable to the
Stockholder Representative at the request of the Stockholder Representative in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.



(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be personally liable as the
Stockholder Representative to any Indemnifying Stockholder for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and
without gross negligence. The Indemnifying Stockholders shall severally (but
not jointly) based on each such Indemnifying Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion
indemnify and defend the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder
Representative harmless against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively,
"Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder
Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
provided, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative
will reimburse the Indemnifying Stockholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by
the Indemnifying Stockholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered
by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the Representative
Fund, and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Stockholders;
provided, that while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be
paid from the Representative Fund and the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve
the Indemnifying Stockholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required
to advance its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Stockholders or
otherwise. The Indemnifying Stockholders acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.



17.6 Reliance on Stockholder Representative. Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Affiliates (including after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the appointment
of Shareholder Representative Services LLC as Stockholder Representative,
effective as of the Effective Time, and treat such Stockholder Representative
as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Indemnifying Stockholder and as
having the duties, power and authority provided for in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates
(including after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or the Escrow
Agent shall be liable to any Indemnifying Stockholder for any actions taken or
omitted by them in reliance upon any instructions, notice or other instruments
delivered by the Stockholder Representative. No resignation of the Stockholder
Representative shall become effective unless at least twenty (20) days prior
written notice of the replacement or resignation of such Stockholder
Representative shall be provided to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Parent,
Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates (including after the Effective Time, 

the Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely at
any time after receipt of any such notice on the most recent notice so
received. If the Stockholder Representative shall be unable or unwilling to

the powers of the Stockholder Representative hereunder shall be appointed by a
written instrument signed by Indemnifying Stockholders who would represent the
Indemnifying Stockholder Threshold.

19.2 Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements and other provisions
set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs and
permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. None of the
parties hereto may assign, transfer or delegate any of their respective rights
or obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without
the consent in writing of the other parties hereto; provided that, Parent and
Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may, without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Company or the Stockholder Representative, assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement
following the Effective Time to (a) any Affiliate of Parent or (b) any
successor of such party by merger, by purchase of all or substantially all of
the assets or stock of Parent or otherwise. The Company and Stockholder
Representative shall execute such acknowledgements of such assignments in such
forms as Parent or Merger Sub (including the Surviving 

Corporation) may from time to time reasonably request. Any purported
assignment or delegation of rights or obligations in violation of this Section
19.2 is void and of no force or effect.

19.3 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto), it being intended that
each of the parties' rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, and any such invalidity,
illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto). If any court
of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such court is hereby irrevocably authorized
to fashion and enforce another provision (instead of the provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and
carries out the intentions of the parties hereto under this Agreement and, in
the event that such court does not exercise such power, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision
(instead of the provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that
is valid, legal and enforceable and carries out the parties' intentions to the
greatest lawful extent under this Agreement.

19.4 Third Parties. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties
hereto and their permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement or any other certificate, document,
instrument or agreement executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon
other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors or assigns,
except if the Effective Time occurs (i) the Parent Indemnified Parties not
party hereto are entitled to the rights and remedies of third party
beneficiaries with respect to SECTION 15 and (ii) the DandO Indemnitees are
entitled to the rights and remedies of third party beneficiaries with respect
to Section 7.12.

19.5 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and all
matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with to any matter which is
the subject of this Agreement, including the validity hereof and the rights
and obligations of the parties hereunder, in all cases, whether in contract or
in tort, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to contracts made and to be performed
entirely in such Commonwealth (without giving effect to the conflicts of laws
provisions thereof); provided, however, that the Merger shall be governed by
the DGCL. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any court of competent civil jurisdiction sitting in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts over any Action arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or related
to any matter which is the subject of this Agreement and each party hereto
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be
heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waive any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of such Action brought in such court or any claim that such Action
brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a judgment in such Action may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by any
applicable Legal Requirement. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in any Action
by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section
19.1 and consents to the exercise of jurisdiction of the courts of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts over it and its properties with respect to any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or in 

connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
enforcement of any rights under this Agreement.

19.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

19.7 Entire Agreement, Not Binding Until Executed. This Agreement, including
the Disclosure Schedule, Schedules and Exhibits and the other agreements
referred to herein (including, the Employment Agreements, the Joinder
Agreements, the Warrant Termination Instruments and the Escrow Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement), is complete, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement
relied upon by all the parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in such
Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or such other agreements and this
Agreement, including such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and such
other agreements, supersede any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements
or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the
extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof is binding
upon or enforceable against any party hereto unless and until the same is
executed and delivered by all of the parties hereto.

19.8 Amendments; No Waiver. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective
Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in
the case of an amendment, by each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a
waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided
that, after approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Company Stockholders and without their further approval, no amendment or
waiver shall reduce the amount or change the kind of consideration to be
received in exchange for any share of Company Stock. No course of dealing and
no failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof
or otherwise prejudice such party's rights, powers and remedies. The failure
of any of the parties to this Agreement to require the performance of a term
or obligation under this Agreement or the waiver by any of the parties to this
Agreement of any breach hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of
such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach
hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy
conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

19.9 Specific Enforcement. It is agreed and understood that in the event any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached by a party hereto, the other party
hereto would be damaged irreparably. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled, at law or in equity.

19.10 Conflicts If the Stockholder Representative so desires, Goodwin Procter
LLP shall be permitted, without the need for any future waiver or consent, to
represent the Stockholder Representative or any Indemnifying Stockholder in
any matter related to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Joinder
Agreement and/or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto (including
claims for indemnification thereunder).
