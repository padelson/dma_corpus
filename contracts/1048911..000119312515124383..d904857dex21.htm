   M. |

The Parties have carefully considered the interests of their stakeholders and

---|--- 
 



7 ---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



      |  conditions of this Merger Protocol, and the importance of FedEx
owning 100% of the Shares or business of TNT Express to allow delisting,
integration and implementation of the joint strategy. Accordingly, the
Parties have agreed to the Asset Sale and subsequent Liquidation of TNT
Express, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Merger Protocol and the Asset Sale Documentation. 
---|--- 
 



   N. | The executive board ( _raad van bestuur_ ) of TNT Express (the
Executive Board) and the supervisory board ( _raad van commissarissen_ ) of
TNT Express (the Supervisory Board and, together with the Executive Board,
the Boards) have in connection with the Offer and the Asset Sale received a
fairness opinion from Goldman Sachs International (Goldman Sachs) to the
effect that, as of such date and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth in the fairness opinion, the Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares
pursuant to the Offer is fair to the holders of Shares from a financial point
of view and the aggregate value of the purchase price for the entire TNT
Express business under the Asset Sale is from a financial point of view fair
to TNT Express, and is in form and substance satisfactory to the Boards and in
support of their recommendation and support of the Offer and the Asset Sale. 
---|--- 



   O. | The Supervisory Board has in connection with the Offer and the
Asset Sale received an opinion from Lazard B.V. (Lazard) to the effect that,
as of such date and subject to the qualifications and assumptions set forth
in the opinion, the Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares pursuant to
the Offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Shares
and the aggregate value of the purchase price for the entire TNT Express
business under the Asset Sale is fair, from a financial point of view fair to
TNT Express. 
---|--- 



   P. | The Boards have approved the terms of this Merger Protocol and
intend to fully support the Offer, the Asset Sale, the actions to be taken at
the EGM of TNT Express and the other transactions contemplated by this
Merger Protocol (the Transactions) and to recommend the Offer and the other
Transactions to the Shareholders, all such subject to and in accordance with
their fiduciary duties and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Merger Protocol. 
---|--- 



   Q. | On 24 February 2013, TNT Express and PostNL N.V. entered into an
amended and restated relationship agreement (the Relationship Agreement). The
Relationship Agreement provides, _inter alia_ , for the terms and conditions
on lock-up and the restrictions on transfer of Shares held by PostNL N.V. in
the event of a third party making a public offer for TNT Express. 
---|--- 
 



8 ---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



    R. | PostNL N.V., holding approximately 14.7% of the Shares on the
date of this Merger Protocol, has agreed in an irrevocable undertaking with
FedEx to tender its Shares in the Offer and, also towards TNT Express by way
of an irrevocable third party stipulation for no consideration (
_onherroepelijk derdenbeding om niet_ ), to vote in favour of the Asset Sale
Resolutions and the Governance Resolutions proposed at the EGM of TNT Express
(the Irrevocable). In addition, Mr. Sjoerd Vollebregt, member of the
Supervisory Board, has committed to tender his Shares in the Offer, subject to
the terms and conditions set out in this Merger Protocol. 
---|--- 
 



   S. | The Parties have discussed and agreed the contents and timing of
(i) the public announcement of Offer, and (ii) communications with the
relevant authorities and employee representatives. The notification
and consultation procedure with respect to the Offer pursuant to the _SER
Fusiegedragsregels 2000_ (the Dutch code in respect of informing and
consulting of trade unions), the Dutch Works Council Act ( _Wet op de
Ondernemingsraden_ ; the WOR) and any other similar laws and regulations of
any jurisdiction other than The Netherlands have been initiated or will be
initiated immediately after execution of this Merger Protocol. 
---|--- 
 



   T. | FedEx confirmed to TNT Express that (i) given its own cash
resources, market capitalisation, and ability to incur additional debt, it
will be able to pay the aggregate Offer Price, and (ii) FedEx will
have readily available funds to complete the Offer and pay the aggregate
consideration due under the Transactions ultimately at the time FedEx will
request the AFM to approve the Offer Document, using available cash resources
and existing and new debt financing. 
---|--- 



    __U.  | The Parties have reached conditional agreement (
_voorwaardelijke overeenstemming_ ) in respect of the Offer, the Asset Sale
and the other Transactions and wish to set out their respective rights and
obligations with respect to the Offer and the other Transactions in this
Merger Protocol. __

incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary (any such entity, other than FedEx, being
referred to in such capacity as __Bidco __) without requiring any further
approval and/or cooperation of TNT Express. TNT Express hereby grants its
consent and its full cooperation to such assignment and/or transfer. In the
event of such assignment, this Merger Protocol shall, insofar as it refers to
FedEx, apply _mutatis mutandis_  to Bidco. FedEx will remain jointly and
severally liable with Bidco for the proper performance of any obligations
assigned and/or transferred to Bidco under this Clause 2.2. __

dividends and other distributions that may be declared or paid in the period
between the date of this Merger Protocol and the Settlement Date other than
the final dividend distribution for the financial year 2014 of EUR 0.08 (in

obligation to, increase the Offer Price in accordance with the Merger Rules. 
---|---

distribution that may be declared or paid by TNT Express in the period between
the date of this Merger Protocol and the earlier of (i) the Settlement
Date, and (ii) 6 June 2016 (the Long Stop Date), other than TNT Expresss
final dividend payment (in whatever form) for the financial year 2014. If
applicable, TNT Express can make a final dividend payment for the financial
year 2015, it being understood that in case of any dividend or distribution
that will be declared or paid before the Settlement Date or the Long Stop
Date, as the case may be, the Offer Price will be reduced accordingly, except
for the final dividend distribution for the financial year 2014. 
---|--- 



   2.4 | Commencement Date

legal counsel that non-deviation would constitute a breach of mandatory

Members and regardless of whether he or she is in office or dismissed,
provided that after dismissal, the dismissed Independent Member(s) must assign
the benefit of such undertaking to a new Independent Member in function,
unless such dismissal is successfully challenged by such Independent Member.
New Independent Members will be appointed based on agreement on the nominee
between the remaining Independent Member (if any) and the other members of the
Supervisory Board, or, in case of disagreement by the members of the
Supervisory Board, by the President of the Enterprise Chamber. FedEx hereby
agrees in advance to the assignment of the benefit of this undertaking by any

     | c. | have FedEx, or any of its Affiliates, in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Merger Protocol, acquire either
(i) all Shares not yet owned by it or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) 100% of
the TNT Express business, including but not limited by implementing the Asset
Sale and Liquidation, and cause TNT Express to operate as a wholly-owned
subsidiary within the FedEx group. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8.2 | Buy-Out 
---|--- 

If, following the Settlement Date and, if applicable, the settlement of
the Shares tendered during the Post-Closing Acceptance Period, FedEx and its
Affiliates, alone or together with TNT Express, hold at least 95% (ninety-five
per cent) of the issued ordinary share capital ( _geplaatst gewoon
aandelenkapitaal_ ) of TNT Express, FedEx shall commence a compulsory
acquisition procedure ( _uitkoopprocedure_ ) in accordance with (i) Article
2:92a or 2:201a of the DCC to buy out the holders of Shares that have not
tendered their Shares, and/or (ii) a takeover buy-out procedure in accordance
with Article 2:359c of the DCC to buy out the holders of Shares that have not
tendered their Shares under the Offer (the Buy-Out). TNT Express shall provide
FedEx with any assistance as may be reasonably required, including, if
needed, joining such procedure as co-claimant.



   8.3 | Asset Sale 
---|--- 

_Asset Sale Rationale_

 



   8.3.1 | TNT Express acknowledges that FedExs willingness to pay the
Offer Price and pursue the Offer and the Combination is predicated on the
acquisition of 100% of the Shares, the ability to delist TNT Express, and
to fully integrate the respective businesses of FedEx and TNT Express and
realise the operational, commercial, organizational, financial and tax
benefits of the Combination. Such benefits could not, or would only partially,
be achieved if TNT Express were to continue as a standalone entity with a
minority shareholder base. 
---|---

   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



 

_Asset Sale Conditions_

 



   8.3.2 | Therefore, and subject only to: 
---|--- 



     | a. | the Asset Sale Resolutions having been passed; 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | completion of the Minority Exit; and 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | the number of Shares having been tendered for acceptance
under the Offer during the Acceptance Period and the Post-Closing Acceptance
Period together with (i) any Shares directly or indirectly held by FedEx or
any of its Affiliates, (ii) any Shares irrevocably committed to FedEx or any
of its Affiliates, in writing, and (iii) any Shares to which FedEx or any of
its Affiliates is entitled ( _gekocht maar nog niet geleverd_ ), in case of
(i), (ii) and (iii) on the date of completion of the Minority Exit,
representing less than 95% (ninety-five per cent) but at least 80% (eighty per
cent) of TNT Expresss aggregate issued and outstanding ordinary share capital
( _geplaatst en uitstaand gewoon kapitaal_ ) (the Asset Sale Range), 
---|---|--- 

the Parties have agreed to a restructuring of the Combination in order to
ensure full integration of the businesses of TNT Express and FedEx pursuant to
the Asset Sale. Accordingly, at the request of FedEx, the Parties will enter
into an asset sale agreement (including schedules) substantially in the form
of _Schedule F_ , together with all amendments reasonably agreed between the
Parties (the Asset Sale Documentation) after Settlement if the Asset Sale
Range has been reached. In such case, subject to the conditions of this
Clause 8.3.2, if FedEx so requests, the Parties shall enter into the Asset
Sale Documentation and implement the Asset Sale and the Liquidation and take
the steps and complete the formalities set forth in the Asset Sale
Documentation.

 

 _Asset Sale disclosure_



   8.3.3 | The terms of the Asset Sale will be described in detail in the
Offer Document, and, where appropriate, in the Position Statement.

   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



 

_Re-evaluation of terms and conditions of Asset Sale_

 



   8.3.4 | If FedEx and its Affiliates, immediately after the end of the
Post-Closing Acceptance Period, hold less than the Asset Sale Range, each of
the Boards will have the right to re-evaluate the terms and conditions of
the Asset Sale as set out in the Asset Sale Documentation in light of the
then prevailing circumstances, and the Boards and the individual members of
the Boards will not be under the obligation to cooperate with the Asset Sale. 
---|--- 
 



   8.4 | Indemnity, insurance and litigation 
---|--- 



   8.4.1 | FedEx hereby undertakes to fully indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, by way of irrevocable third party stipulation for no consideration (
_onherroepelijk derdenbeding om niet_ ), TNT Express, each current and
future member of the Boards, any member of TNT Expresss Group, their
respective employees, board members and officers and, if FedEx determines to
pursue the Liquidation, the Liquidator and managing directors of the
Liquidator (each of them an Indemnified Party) against any present and
future, actual or contingent, ascertained or unascertained or disputed, known
or unknown, reported and unreported or other damages, liabilities, losses,
costs (including reasonable fees and expenses of advisors) and fines
(collectively Losses) arising, accruing or (to be) incurred by any Indemnified
Party arising directly or indirectly from the Asset Sale and/or Liquidation
and any acts or omissions in connection with preparing, proposing or
implementing the Asset Sale and/or Liquidation, in each case: 
---|--- 



     | a. | excluding any Losses arising, accruing or incurred as a
result of a material breach of his or her obligations under this Merger
Protocol or the Asset Sale Documentation, or fraud ( _bedrog_ ), gross
negligence ( _grove schuld_ ), or wilful misconduct ( _opzet_ ) by such
Indemnified Party, as finally established by a court decision or settlement
agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | except to the extent covered by insurance and actually paid
out pursuant to any insurance taken out for the benefit of an Indemnified
Party; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | c. | excluding any Losses exclusively incurred by such Indemnified
Party in his or her capacity as a holder of Shares, including without
limitation any withholding taxes and other taxes on any liquidation
distributions to such Indemnified Party as part of the Liquidation. 
---|---|--- 
 



40 ---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



    8.4.2 | FedEx shall procure that a DandO insurance policy is maintained
(including coverage for claims from Shareholders) for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties providing for run-off cover for a period of up to 5
(five) years after the completion of the Asset Sale, which policy provides in
all other respects substantially equivalent cover as TNT Expresss DandO
insurance policy in force as at the date of this Merger Protocol. 
---|--- 
 



   8.4.3 | FedEx will have sole control over any litigation relating to
any Losses for which the Indemnified Party is seeking to be indemnified
hereunder, including over any correspondence, negotiations and other
communications with third parties that could potentially result in
litigation. If so requested, FedEx shall keep the Indemnified Party properly
informed and provide the Indemnified Party the opportunity to review and
comment upon any correspondence, negotiations and other communications by
FedEx with third parties.

capital, in which circumstances the pre-emptive rights ( _voorkeursrechten_ ),
if any, of minority shareholders of TNT Express could be excluded;

the extent the Boards have in their reasonable opinion determined that doing
so is reasonably necessary to assess whether such Alternative Proposal could

   12.2.1 | A Potential Superior Offer is an unsolicited written
Alternative Proposal to make a (public) offer for all Shares or for all or
substantially all of the business or assets of TNT Express or a legal merger
or reverse takeover involving TNT Express, made by a party who, in the
reasonable opinion of the Boards, taking into account their fiduciary duties,
is a _bona fide_ third party, and which proposal, in the reasonable opinion of
the Boards, could reasonably be expected to qualify as or evolve into a
Superior Offer. 
---|--- 

_Superior Offer_

 



   12.2.2 | An Alternative Proposal will be a Superior Offer if all of the
following conditions are met: 
---|--- 



     | __a.  | the Alternative Proposal is a _bona fide_ unsolicited
written offer or proposal relating to an Alternative Proposal for (i) a full
public offer ( _volledig bod_ ) or mandatory offer ( _verplicht bod_ ) for
the Shares, (ii) a legal merger resulting in the control over all or
substantially all the Shares, or (iii) an acquisition of all or substantially
all of the business or assets of TNT Express, by a party who, in the
reasonable opinion of the Boards, is a _bona fide_ party; __ 
---|---|--- 



     | b. |

in the reasonable opinion of the Boards, taking into account their fiduciary
duties and having consulted their financial and legal advisors,
the Alternative Proposal is substantially more beneficial 

---|---|--- 
 



55 ---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



      |  to TNT Express and its Shareholders, employees and other
stakeholders than the Offer, taking into account the strategy of the
Combination, the overall terms and conditions set out in this Merger Protocol
(including the deal certainty aspects such as the Asset Sale) and, taking into
account the overall terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal, and the
certainty and timing thereof, including the pre-offer conditions and
offer conditions, level and nature of consideration, certainty of financing,
integration of the businesses, the position of the employees, other matters
contemplated by the Non-Financial Covenants, and compliance with Antitrust
Laws and regulatory requests and the transaction structure; 
---|--- 



     | c. | the total consideration payable to the Shareholders in
connection with such Alternative Proposal (including any dividend proposed to
be effected in connection therewith) exceeds the Offer Price as mentioned in
the First Announcement by at least 8% (eight per cent); 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | the Alternative Proposal is legally binding on the third
party such that the third party has conditionally committed itself to TNT
Express to announce the Alternative Proposal within a week, and in the event
of a full public offer make the Alternative Proposal within 8 (eight) weeks
in accordance with the Decree and in any event within the timeframes
applicable as set in the Decree and the DFSA; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | e. | the consideration payable in the Alternative Proposal may not
consist of any securities that are not publicly traded on a regulated market. 
---|---|--- 
 

 _Other considerations_



   12.2.3 |

If the consideration payable to the Shareholders in connection with a
Potential Superior Offer or Superior Offer comprises solely or partly
of securities, the securities component of such consideration is to be valued
by the Boards in their calculation of whether the threshold in Clause
12.2.2(c) is exceeded, at prevailing market prices and practices, as at the
date that the comparison is made, after obtaining advice from its financial
advisors. To the extent that the Potential Superior Offer or Superior Offer is
an offer for all or substantially all of the assets of TNT Express and its
Group, the calculation will be made on the basis of the net proceeds 

---|--- 
 



56 ---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



      |  (excluding dividend withholding tax) to be distributed to the
Shareholders resulting from such a transaction calculated on a per Share
basis.

proposed consideration, the conditions to (the making of) the Potential
Superior Offer, the contemplated governance and matters contemplated by the
Non-Financial Covenants, the Antitrust Laws and other regulatory requirements

Potential Superior Offer for a reasonable period which will in any event not
exceed 10 (ten) Business Days starting on the date of FedExs receipt of the
First Notice; 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | provide non-public, confidential information to the third
party making the Potential Superior Offer, provided that such third party will
receive the same information as provided to FedEx, except if and to the extent
the Boards determine, taking into account their fiduciary duties and having
consulted their financial and legal advisors, that the third party reasonably
requires additional information to be able to make a Superior Offer. In that
case, FedEx will simultaneously receive the same additional information
provided to such third party. TNT Express shall not provide any information or
data to any person in connection with such Potential Superior Offer, before
the proposing party has first signed a confidentiality agreement on terms no
less stringent than those of the Non-Disclosure Agreement; and

accordance with Clause 3 and that TNT Express has discontinued considering the

conditions which are, determined by the Boards, taking into account their
fiduciary duties and having consulted their financial and legal advisors, to
be, on balance, at least equally beneficial to TNT Express and the
Shareholders, employees and other stakeholders as the Superior Offer, taking
into account the strategy of the Combination, the offer price, the overall
terms and conditions, the certainty and timing thereof, including the pre-
offer conditions and offer conditions, level and nature of consideration,
certainty of financing, integration of the businesses, position of the
employees and the other matters contemplated by the other Non-Financial
Covenants, compliance with Antitrust Laws and regulatory requests, and the
transaction structure. 
---|--- 
 

 _Consequences Matched Offer_



   12.4.4 | If FedEx has exercised its Matching Right and has made a
Matched Offer within the Matching Offer Period, TNT Express shall not be
entitled to accept the Superior Offer or terminate this Merger Protocol and

withdraw or, as applicable, modify the Recommendation and the Position
Statement. If TNT Express accepts the Superior Offer, which acceptance shall
be communicated to FedEx by TNT Express as soon as possible but within 5

Protocol in accordance with Clause 13.

the Boards and each of their members individually shall, as set forth in the
Asset Sale Documentation and subject to the terms and conditions of such Asset
Sale Documentation, continue to cooperate with the Asset Sale if FedEx and its
Affiliates, alone or together with FedEx, immediately after the completion of
the Minority Exit, have reached or exceeded the Asset Sale Range.

---|--- 



    __12.5.1  | Clauses 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 apply _mutatis mutandis_ to
any consecutive (Potential) Superior Offer, including a new Superior Offer,
which must exceed the consideration per Share of the Matched Offer by at least
5% (five per cent) and meet the other requirements set out in the definition

   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



 

_Fraud_



   20.2.5 | Nothing in this Merger Protocol limits or excludes any
liability for fraud ( _bedrog_ ). 
---|--- 



   20.3 | Amendments 
---|--- 

A variation to this Merger Protocol is valid only if it is in writing
and signed by each of the Parties.



   20.4 | No assignment of rights and obligations 
---|---

   20.4.2 | Upon or concurrent with the transfer of TNT Expresss assets

 between and understanding of the Parties in respect of the Offer and the
Transactions and any preceding or concurrent oral or written agreements or
arrangements between the Parties in relation thereto are hereby superseded.



   20.7 | Invalidity 
---|--- 

The Parties acknowledge the reasonableness of the provisions of this
Merger Protocol. If any provision of this Merger Protocol (including, without
limitation, any sentence, Clause or part hereof) will be adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed amended to delete
therefrom the portion thus adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such
deletion to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the
particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made. In addition, the
Parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding part by provisions which are
valid and binding and the legal effect of which, given the contents and
purpose of this Merger Protocol, is, to the greatest extent possible, similar
to that of the invalid or non-binding part. Furthermore, if any particular
provision contained in this Merger Protocol will for any reason be held to be
excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it
will be construed by limiting and reducing such provision as to
such characteristic so that the provision is enforceable to the fullest
extent compatible with the Applicable Law as it will then apply.



   20.8 | No rescission 
---|--- 

Without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 13, to the extent permitted by
the Merger Rules, each of the Parties waives its rights, if any, to in whole
or in part annul, rescind or dissolve (including any _gehele dan wel parti ele

its rights to request in whole or in part the annulment, rescission,
dissolution or cancellation of this Merger Protocol, including (but not
limited to) on the basis of articles 7:17 ( _conformiteit_ ) and 6:228 (
_dwaling_ ) of the DCC. Furthermore, each of the Parties waives its rights,
if any, to in whole or in part seek the alteration of this Merger Protocol
pursuant to article 6:230 of the DCC.



   20.9 | Specific performance 
---|--- 

The Parties acknowledge that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Merger Protocol were not

 



69 ---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |    ![LOGO](g904857ex2_1logo.jpg)  |  | 



 

 performed in accordance with their specific terms and agree that they are
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Merger Protocol and to seek to specifically enforce ( _nakoming_ ) the terms
hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled.

or communications to be provided in connection with this Merger Protocol must
be in English or accompanied by an English translation; in this case the

statutory or other official document or communication.



   21 | GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Merger Protocol is construed in accordance with and shall be governed
exclusively by the laws of The Netherlands.



   21.2 | Jurisdiction

right of each Party to seek injunctive relief with the relevant Dutch courts (

Protocol (including any dispute as to the validity of this Merger Protocol,

authority (corporate or otherwise) to carry on its respective business as

to authorise it to perform its obligations pursuant to this Merger Protocol
and neither the execution of this Merger Protocol by TNT Express, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will conflict with,
or result in, any breach of any material obligation of TNT Express or trigger
any obligations or liabilities of material importance for TNT Express as a
whole.  
---|---|--- 



     | d. | This Merger Protocol has been duly and properly executed and
duly delivered, as required by law, by TNT Express, and assuming due

     | j. | The public disclosures made by or on behalf of TNT Express
since 2014 (including but not limited to regulatory filings, financial
statements, press releases and other information communicated to the market)
are true and accurate in all material respects and do not require any further
disclosure or update in order to avoid any such prior disclosure being
materially incorrect, misleading or incomplete by reference to the date of the
relevant disclosure and TNT Express has not failed to observe any obligation
