                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

                  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of
August 15, 2007, by and among Thomas & Betts Corporation, a Tennessee
corporation ("Parent"); T&B Acquisition II Corp., an Ohio corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and The Lamson & Sessions Co.,
an Ohio corporation (the "Company").

                                    RECITALS

                  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company each have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective shareholders to consummate, the acquisition of the
Company by Parent by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
whereby each issued and outstanding common share (collectively, the "Shares"),
without par value, of the Company (collectively, the "Common Stock"), other than
Dissenting Shares and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or held in the treasury of the Company, will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration; and

                  WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein
in connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

                  Section 1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will
be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), whereupon the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue as
the surviving corporation. The Company as the surviving corporation after the
Merger is referred to in this Agreement as the "Surviving Corporation."

                  Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no
later than the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of
Jones Day, North Point, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, unless
another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement.

                  Section 1.3 Effective Time. The parties to this Agreement
shall cause a certificate of merger to be executed and filed on the Closing Date
(or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree), with the Secretary
of State of the State of Ohio in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of Ohio Law. The Merger will become
effective at the time the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Ohio or such time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the certificate of merger (such time is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Effective Time").



<PAGE>


                  Section 1.4 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger will be as provided in the applicable provisions of Ohio
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the
foregoing, at the Effective Time all the assets, property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers, franchises and authority of the Company and Merger Sub will
vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

                  Section 1.5 Articles of Incorporation; Code of Regulations.


                  (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, will be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except that the
corporate name of Merger Sub shall at the Effective Time be changed to the
corporate name of the Company, until the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation are thereafter further amended as provided by Law and such
Articles of Incorporation.


                  (b) At the Effective Time, the Code of Regulations of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, will be the Code of
Regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by
Law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Code of
Regulations.

                  Section 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time
will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of
Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the Code of Regulations of
the Surviving Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE II

                      EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

                  Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:

                  (a) At the Effective Time each Share issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and be converted into the right to receive $27.00 in cash payable
to the holder of such Share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon
(i) surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Share (a
"Certificate") in the manner provided in Section 2.2 or (ii) in the case of an
uncertificated Share which immediately prior to the Effective Time was
registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (an
"Uncertificated Share"), transfer of such Uncertificated Share in the manner
provided in Section 2.2. All such Shares, when so converted at the Effective
Time, will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired
and cease to exist. As of the Effective Time each holder of a Certificate or an
Uncertificated Share will cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the
surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares in accordance
with Section 2.2, without interest.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>


                  (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each
Share owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent immediately before the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished,
and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect to such Shares.


                  (c) Each share of common stock, without par value, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

                  Section 2.2 Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer
Books.


                  (a) Before the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate the
Company's transfer agent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive the funds necessary to make the payments
contemplated by Section 2.1(a). At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in a
separate account for the benefit of holders of Shares (the "Payment Fund") the
aggregate consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 2.1(a). If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made
in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. The Paying Agent
shall invest the funds provided by Parent in the manner specified by Parent, and
interest payable thereon shall be solely for the account of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
and in any event not later than two Business Days following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (i) a letter of transmittal (which must specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares will pass, only upon delivery or transfer, as applicable,
to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as
the Company and Merger Sub may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use
in surrendering Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of a Certificate, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares may thereafter until the first anniversary of the Effective Time
surrender such Certificate, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares to the Paying
Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon
(A) delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal and the surrender of
Certificates or (B) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)
in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, in each case, on
or before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by
such Certificate or such Uncertificated Shares, without interest. Until so
surrendered, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share (other than Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting Shares and Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares representing Shares held by Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or in the treasury of the Company)
will represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration
relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares, without interest.

                  (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
cancelled Shares is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it
will be a condition to such payment that (i) either the Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii)
that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate or Uncertificated Share surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub or the Paying Agent
that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates or such Uncertificated
Shares, subject, however to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
unpaid cash dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time that have
been properly declared by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

                  (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company will be closed and there will not be any further registration of
transfers of any shares of the Company's capital stock thereafter on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged for
Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. No interest will accrue or
be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of a Certificate or Certificates
or transfer of Uncertificated Shares which immediately before the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares.

                  (e) Promptly following the date which is one year after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any cash (including any interest received with respect to
such cash), Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transactions"), which had been made
available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and thereafter such holders will be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, without any interest on such Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation
nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by any such holders of shares of Company Stock three
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

                  (f) The Merger Consideration paid in the Merger will be net to
the holder of Shares in cash, subject to reduction only for withholding of any
applicable federal, state, local or foreign taxes or, as set forth in Section
2.2(c), stock transfer taxes payable by such holder. If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

                  Section 2.3 Treatment of Stock Plans.

                  (a) At the Effective Time each holder of a then-outstanding
option (the "Options") to purchase Shares under the Stock Plans will be entitled
to receive, in settlement thereof, for each Share subject to such Option, a cash
payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the sum of (x) the
Merger Consideration plus (y) any cash dividends declared by the Company in
accordance with Section 5.1 (such dividends together with the Merger
Consideration, the "Equity Consideration") (or, if greater in the case of the
Company's 1988 Incentive Equity Performance Plan, the "Change in Control Price,"
as defined therein) over the per share exercise price of the Options and (ii)
the number of Shares subject to such holder's Options not previously exercised,
whether or not then vested and exercisable.

                  (b) At the Effective Time, each holder of a then-outstanding
stock appreciation right (a "SAR") with respect to Shares under the Stock Plans
will be entitled to receive, in settlement thereof, for each Share subject to
such SAR a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the
Equity Consideration over the base price per Share under the SAR and (ii) the
number of Shares subject to such holders' SARs not previously exercised, whether
or not then vested and exercisable.

                  (c) Each outstanding unvested restricted share issued pursuant
to a Stock Plan (each, a "Restricted Share") shall, at the Effective Time, be
vested and no longer subject to restrictions and will be canceled and be
converted into, and become the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, which
shall be payable in accordance with Section 2.1(a).

                  (d) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be
subject to any required withholding of federal, state, local or foreign taxes
and shall be paid without interest. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the applicable
Options, SARs or Restricted Shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

<PAGE>


                  (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents or releases from the
holders of Options, SARs and Restricted Shares under the Stock Plans and take
all such other lawful action as may be necessary (which include, but are not
limited to, satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, without incurring any liability in connection therewith) to
provide for and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.3; provided, that notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.3,
payment may be withheld in respect of any Option, SAR or Restricted Share until
such necessary consents are obtained. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing
by the parties, (i) the Stock Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time and
(ii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assure that following
the Effective Time, no participant in the Stock Plans shall have any right under
the Stock Plans to acquire the capital stock of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Transactions, and any other dispositions of
equity interests of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection
with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") or a committee of two or more
non-employee directors of the Company (as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Such approval shall specify: (A) the name
of each officer or director, (B) the number of securities to be disposed of for
each named person, and (C) that the approval is granted for purposes of
exempting the transaction under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

                  Section 2.4 Dissenting Shares.

                  (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any Shares held by a holder who has demanded and perfected his, her or
its demand for appraisal of his, her or its Shares in accordance with Ohio Law
(including but not limited to Section 1701.85 of Ohio Law) and as of the
Effective Time has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his, her or its right
to such appraisal ("Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into or represent
a right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.1(a), but the holder of the
Dissenting Shares will be entitled to only such rights as are granted to holders
of Dissenting Shares by Ohio Law.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if any
holder of Shares who demands appraisal of his, her or its Shares under Ohio Law
effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his,
her or its right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence
of such event, whichever later occurs, such holder's Shares will automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the Certificate or Certificates representing such Shares or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 2.2.

                  (c) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Ohio Law received by
the Company, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

                  Section 2.5 Subsequent Actions. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

                  Section 2.6 Adjustments. If, during the period between the
date hereof and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall
occur, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, or pursuant to the Company Rights
Agreement, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Options,
the Merger Consideration, and any dividends permitted to be declared by the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 5.1, shall be
appropriately adjusted.

                  Section 2.7 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  Except as disclosed in the corresponding section of the letter
from the Company, dated the date hereof, addressed to Merger Sub and Parent (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (or in a different section of the Company
Disclosure Letter where the applicability of such disclosure to the applicable
Section of this Agreement is readily apparent on its face), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

                  Section 3.1 Organization.


                  (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation,
partnership or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite
corporate or other power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing or to have such power, authority and governmental approvals has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore furnished or
otherwise made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Amended
Articles of Incorporation and the Amended Code of Regulations of the Company,
each as currently in effect.


                                      -7-
<PAGE>


                  (b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a true and complete list of all of the Company's Subsidiaries and their
jurisdictions of organization. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries owns any equity interest in any corporation or other Person.

                  Section 3.2 Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company
Action.


                  (a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the
consummation by it of the Transactions, have been duly and validly authorized by
the Company Board, and no other corporate action on the part of the Company is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions, except for the
affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Shares as
contemplated by Section 6.2. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, is a valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to
equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

                  (b) Assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty
in Section 4.4, the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding Shares is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Company's capital stock that is necessary to approve the Merger or the
Transactions and approve and adopt this Agreement.

                  (c) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company Board
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company's shareholders and
has declared this Agreement advisable, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Transactions, (iii) resolved (subject to Section 5.2) to recommend adoption of
this Agreement by its shareholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board
Recommendation") and (iv) approved and adopted an amendment to the Company
Rights Agreement to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Merger, this
Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby (a copy of which amendment
was provided to Parent by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement).

under, and other applicable requirements of, (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), and (iii) the filing of the certificate of merger, none of the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by
the Company of the Transactions or compliance by the Company with any of the
provisions of this Agreement will (a) contravene or conflict with or result in
any breach of any provision of the Amended Articles of Incorporation or the
Amended Code of Regulations of the Company or similar organizational documents
of any of the Company's Subsidiaries, (b) require any filing with or any other
action by or in respect of, or permit, authorization, consent or approval of,
any domestic, foreign, federal, state or local court, arbitral tribunal,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental, regulatory or
administrative authority, department or agency (a "Governmental Entity"), (c)
require any consent or other action by any Person under, result in a violation
or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or
both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is entitled) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, permit,
approval, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of
their properties or assets may be bound (the "Company Agreements"), (d) result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (e) contravene, conflict with or violate or breach any Order
or Law applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (b), (c), (d) or (e) where
failure to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or approvals or to make
such filings or take such actions, or where such violations, breaches or
defaults would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 3.4 Capitalization.

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
1,200,000 shares of serial preferred stock, par value of $10.00 per share (the
"Preferred Stock"), 3,000,000 shares of serial preference stock, without par

Stock are, and all shares of Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to the
exercise of outstanding Options will be, when issued in accordance with the
terms of the Options, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable. Except as set forth in this Section 3.4(a) and for changes
resulting from the exercise of the Options outstanding as of the date hereof and
as provided in the Rights Agreement, dated September 8, 1998 and as amended on
May 5, 2005, by and between the Company and National City Bank (the "Company

(v) shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company, (w)
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or other

<PAGE>


                  (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interest of each of the Subsidiaries are beneficially and of record owned
by the Company, directly or indirectly, and all such shares have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by either the Company

understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the voting of the capital stock of the Company or any of the

                  Section 3.5 SEC Reports and Financial Statements. (a) The
Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC, and has made available to
Parent, true and complete copies of all forms, reports, schedules, statements,
prospectuses, registration statements and other documents required to be filed
or furnished by it since January 1, 2005, under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") (as such documents
have been amended prior to the date hereof since the time of their filing,
collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates or, if
amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment
prior to the date hereof, the Company SEC Documents, including any financial
statements or schedules included therein (A) did not, and each Company SEC
Document filed after the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in the
Company SEC Documents or necessary in order to make the statements in the
Company SEC Documents, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and (B) complied, and each Company SEC Document filed after the
date hereof will comply, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be. None of the Company's Subsidiaries are
required to file any forms, reports, schedules, statements, prospectuses,
registration statements or other documents with the SEC. Each of the
consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Company SEC Documents (the "Financial Statements") (w) has been prepared from,
and is in accordance with, the books and records of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, (x) complies in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect to such requirements, (y) has been prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), in all material
respects, applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the Financial Statements or in the notes to the Financial
Statements and subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure) and (z) fairly
presents in accordance with GAAP, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows
(and changes in financial position, if any) of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the date and for the periods referred to in the Financial
Statements.

                  (b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being
prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in the Company's
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

                  (c) Since January 1, 2005, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have established and maintained a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) ("internal
controls" ). Such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the
preparation of Company financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and audit
committee (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in internal controls.

                  (d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of
credit made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer
(as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company. The
Company has not, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

                  (e) Each of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, and the
statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

                  (f) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, since
December 31, 2004, there has been no transaction, or series of similar
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are there any
proposed transactions as of the date of this Agreement, or series of similar
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries was or is to be a party, that would be required to be
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.
Section 3.5(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter describes, and the Company has
delivered to Parent copies of the documentation creating or governing, all
securitization transactions and other off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined

foregoing in combination; provided, however, that if for any reason this
Agreement is terminated and the Merger is abandoned, then such amendments shall

this Agreement by the Company, is a valid and binding obligation of each of

Parent or Merger Sub is entitled) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, permit,

release under any standstill or similar agreement, or under the Company Rights
Plan, with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that prior to the receipt of Shareholder
Approval, in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof that was not solicited by the Company, any of its
Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries, if the
Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that (A) such Company Takeover Proposal is
reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and (B) failing to
take any such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board, the Company and the Representatives of the Company may (after
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) provide any non-public
information regarding the Company to the third party making such Company
Takeover Proposal (provided that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such third party) or engage in any negotiations or substantive discussions with
such Person regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative of the Company, with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause any such party (or its agents or advisors)
in possession of confidential information about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives to return or destroy all such
information.

                  (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company
Takeover Proposal (the actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change" ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the
date hereof and prior to the Shareholder Approval, in response to a Company
Superior Proposal made after the date hereof which was not solicited by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their Representatives, the Company
Board may (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to and subject to compliance
with Section 8.1(c)(i) and cause the Company to enter into an agreement with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal, and/or (y) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, but only if, in the case of clauses (x) and (y), (1) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that failing to take any such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, (2) the Company
shall have provided Parent with written notice at least four Business Days
before making an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement and
attaching the most current version of all relevant proposed transaction
agreements and other material documents (and a description of all material terms
and conditions thereof (including the identity of the party making such Company
Superior Proposal), (3) the Company causes its financial and legal advisors to,
during such four Business Day period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in
good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Company Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal, and
(4) Parent does not make, during such four Business Day period, an offer that is
at least as favorable in the aggregate to the shareholder of the Company as such
Company Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the
applicable Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements
of this Section 5.2(b) with respect to such new written notice (to the extent so
required), except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three Business
Days.

                  (c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than two
business days) advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Company
Takeover Proposal and of the material terms of and the identity of the Person
making any such Company Takeover Proposal, and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a current basis, of any changes thereto. The Company shall promptly
advise Parent orally and in writing of the commencement of any discussions with
any third party or its representatives regarding a Company Takeover Proposal by
such third party.

                  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or in Section 6.6
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the
Company's shareholders if, in the Company Board's determination in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure so to disclose would
be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided, that such
requirement will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such requirement would otherwise have under this Agreement.

incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement information reasonably
requested by the Company. The Company shall promptly furnish the preliminary
Proxy Statement and the definitive Proxy Statement, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, to Parent and give Parent and its legal counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such preliminary Proxy
Statement, or amendment or supplement thereto, prior to filing with the SEC, and
the Company shall consider in good faith all comments of Parent in connection
therewith. In addition, the Company will provide Merger Sub and its counsel, in
writing, with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement promptly after the receipt of such comments or other
communications, and the opportunity to review and comment on such comments.

                  (c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to
promptly (i) correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided
by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information
that shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy
Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so
corrected or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the
holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws.

then owned by it, Merger Sub or any of its other Subsidiaries and Affiliates in
favor of the approval of the Merger and the approval and adoption of this
Agreement.

                  Section 6.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

                  (a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
in the most expeditious manner possible the Transactions as promptly as
practicable including, but not limited to, (i) the preparation and filing of all
forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of the other parties' conditions to
consummating the Transactions, (iii) using commercially reasonable efforts
necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any
consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third
party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing
all information required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of
or filings with any other Governmental Entity) required to be obtained or made
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by the
Transactions or by this Agreement, (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all conditions
precedent to the Merger and shall not take any action after the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining
of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any
Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to Closing.

                  (b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult
with the other parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary
information with respect to and provide the other parties (or their counsel)
copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any
other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall
promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement of any communication from
(i) any Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions or (ii) any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person may be required in connection with the
Transactions. If any party to this Agreement or any Affiliate of such parties
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such party will
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other parties to this Agreement, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. To the extent that
transfers of any permits, authorizations or approvals issued by any Governmental
Entity are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such transfers.

                  (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later
than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, file notifications
under the HSR Act and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to any inquiries
received from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and to
respond, as promptly as practicable, to all inquiries and requests received from
any state Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in connection with
antitrust matters.

                  (d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state or foreign Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith, if any
Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the Company
shall cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to
contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or
restricts consummation of the Merger or any other Transactions, including by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal
unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that litigation is
not in their respective best interests. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after the
execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.3(d) shall limit the
right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
so long as such party hereto has, up to the time of termination, complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.3(d).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto
understand and agree that commercially reasonable efforts of any party hereto
shall not require, and no other provision in this Agreement shall be construed
as requiring, (i) the entry into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), granting a license, or taking
any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing ) with
respect to any of Parent's, the Company's, or the Surviving Corporation's
subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates' businesses, assets or
properties.

                  Section 6.4 Notification of Certain Matters. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Merger Sub and Parent
and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence would be likely
to cause either any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time or any condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied
on the Effective Time and (b) any material failure of the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee, agent or
representative of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent as applicable, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 or Section 6.3(b) shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the party
receiving such notice.

                  Section 6.5 Access; Confidentiality. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of
information, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent and its Representatives,
from time to time prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement, such information and access to its offices, properties,
employees and books and records (including, without limitation, for the purposes
of conducting Phase I or Phase II environmental site assessments or other
environmental investigations; provided, Parent shall not conduct Phase II
investigations at the Company's facility in Kent, Ohio) with respect to, or
access to the offices, properties, books and records of, the Company and its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, financial condition and operations
as Parent shall reasonably request and (ii) instruct its and its Subsidiaries
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other representatives to
cooperate with Parent in its investigation. Parent shall, and shall cause
Parent's Affiliates and Representatives to hold any non-public information
received from the other, directly or indirectly, in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
make available to Parent all written environmental investigations, studies,
audits, tests, reviews or other analyses in their possession or control relating
to the current or prior business of the Company or any Subsidiary or any
property currently or previously owned, leased or operated by the Company or any
Subsidiary upon Parent's request for the same.

                  Section 6.6 Publicity. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither the Company, Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect
to this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consultation of the
other party, except as such party reasonably believes, after receiving the
advice of outside counsel and after informing all other parties to this
Agreement, another form of press release may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange or trading market.

                  Section 6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers'
Insurance.

                  (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted under Ohio Law, indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
each such individual who served at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") against all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or
investigative, based on the fact that such individual is or was serving at the
request of the Company or its Subsidiaries and arising out of or pertaining to
any action or omission occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the
Transactions). The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to assume the defense
of any such claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Surviving Corporation
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises
that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving
Corporation, the Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

<PAGE>


                  (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, provide, for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time, the Company's current directors and officers (as
defined to mean those persons insured under such policy) with an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than the
existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance
in excess of 300 percent of the aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company
for such insurance in 2007, through the date of this Agreement on an annualized
basis (the "D&O Premium"), but in such case shall purchase as much of such
coverage as possible for such amount; and provided, further, however, that at
Parent's option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Surviving
Corporation may purchase "tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage
identical in all material respects to the coverage described above and such
purchases do not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) The Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification set forth in the Amended Code of Regulations of the Company,
which provisions shall not be amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder as of the Effective Time of any individual who at
the Effective Time is a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
is or previously was serving at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries
as a director, trustee, officer, member, manager, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company,
pension or other employee benefit plan or other enterprise, unless such
modification is required after the Effective Time by law and then only to the
minimum extent required by such law.

                  (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section
6.7 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under the
Amended Articles of Incorporation and Amended Code of Regulations (or other
governing documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Ohio Law
or any other applicable Laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.7 shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

                  (e) In the event that the Parent or Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its other Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect
Parent Plans which provide benefits which are not less favorable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided by the Company Plans other than any Company
Plans that are equity compensation plans or arrangements.

                  (b) Eligibility. With respect to any Parent Plan in which any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries first becomes eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each such employee and his
or her eligible dependents under such Parent Plan, except to the extent such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods applied immediately prior
thereto under the analogous Company Plan; (ii) provide such employee and his or
her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to becoming eligible to participate in such Parent Plan under the
analogous Company Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under such
Company Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or annual or lifetime
maximum out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan; and (iii) recognize
all service of such employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
predecessors (including recognition of all prior service with any entity
(including any such Subsidiary prior to its becoming a Subsidiary of the
Company) that was recognized by the Company (or any such Subsidiary) prior to
the date hereof in the ordinary course of administering its (or such
Subsidiary's) employee benefits), for purposes of eligibility to participate in
and vesting in benefits under such Parent Plan, to the extent that such service
was recognized for such purpose under the analogous Company Plan.

                  (c) Employees Subject to Collective Bargaining.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this Section
6.9 shall not apply with respect to the terms and conditions of employment or
compensation or employee benefits of any employees of the Company, Parent and
any of their Subsidiaries who are represented by labor unions or similar
collective bargaining entities, which will be governed by the applicable
collective bargaining agreements.

                  (d) No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Section 6.9 is not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder. Regardless of anything else contained herein, the parties
hereto do not intend for this Agreement to amend any Company Plans, Parent Plans
or arrangements or create any rights or obligations except between the parties
to this Agreement.

                  Section 6.10 Repayment of Indebtedness.

                  (a) On or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to Parent copies of payoff letters (subject to delivery of funds
as arranged by Parent), in commercially reasonable form, from the administration
agent under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November
20, 2006 among the Company, the lenders, National City Bank and JPMorgan Chase

the Merger. The respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger shall
be subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each of the
following conditions, any and all of which may be waived in whole or in part by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law:

                  (a) Shareholder Approval. The Merger and this Agreement shall

Sub. The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger is further
subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent of the following conditions:

warranties of the Company set forth in (i) Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.16(f),

(ii) Article III, other than those to which clause (i) above applies, shall be
true and correct (disregarding for purposes of this Section 7.2(a) any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification contained therein) as of
the Effective Time as though made at and as of such time (or, if made as of a
specific date, at and as of such date), except in the case of this clause (ii)
where the failure to be so true and correct has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company
shall have performed in all material respects (or with respect to any obligation
or agreement qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in all
respects) all obligations and agreements, and complied in all material respects
(or with respect to any covenant qualified by materiality, in all respects) with
all covenants, contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by

prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, (ii) seeking
to restrain or prohibit Parent's, Merger Sub's or any of Parent's other
Affiliates' (x) ability effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the

                  (e) There shall not have occurred or been discovered any
change, event, occurrence or development which, individually or in the
aggregate, has or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  Section 7.3 Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The
obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true
and correct at and as of the Closing (without regard to any qualifications
therein as to materiality or material adverse effect), as though made at and as
of such time (or, if made as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except
for such failures to be true and correct as would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

                  (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects (or with
respect to any obligation or agreement qualified by materiality or material
adverse effect, in all respects) all obligations and agreements, and complied in
all material respects with all covenants, contained in this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to or on the Closing Date.

                  (c) Officer's Certificate. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
have furnished the Company with a certificate dated the Closing Date signed on
its behalf by an executive officer to the effect that the conditions set forth
in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) have been satisfied.

                  Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Parent
or Merger Sub nor the Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth
in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied
to excuse it from its obligations hereunder if such failure was caused by such
party's failure to comply with its obligations to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to
Section 6.3.

                                   TERMINATION

                  Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time
(notwithstanding any Shareholder Approval):

                  (a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub and the Company;

                  (b) by either Parent or the Company if:

                                    (i) the Merger has not been consummated on
                  or before January 31, 2008 (the "Outside Date"); provided,
                  however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
                  to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
                  whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the
                  failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time; provided
                  further, however, that, if, on the Outside Date, either of the
                  conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 7.1(b) or
                  Section 7.1(c) shall not have been fulfilled but all other
                  conditions to the Closing either have been fulfilled or are
                  then capable of being fulfilled, then the Outside Date shall,
                  without any action on the part of the parties hereto, be
                  extended to April 30, 2008, and such date shall become the
                  Outside Date for purposes of this Agreement;

                                    (ii) a Restraint which, in the case of an
                  Order, is final and nonappealable, shall have been issued or
                  come into effect restraining or otherwise prohibiting
                  consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions;
                  provided, however, that the party seeking to terminate this
                  Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall have used
                  its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of
                  such permanent injunction, including by satisfying its
                  obligations under Section 6.3; or

                                    (iii) if the Special Meeting (including any
                  adjournments and postponements thereof) shall have concluded
                  without the Shareholder Approval having been obtained.

                                    (c) by the Company, if prior to receipt of
                  the Shareholder Approval:

                                    (i) the Company Board authorizes the
                  Company, subject to complying with the terms of this
                  Agreement, to enter into a written agreement concerning a
                  Company Superior Proposal, provided, that concurrently with
                  such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee payable
                  pursuant to Section 8.2(b) ; or

                                    (ii) a breach of any representation or
                  warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on
                  the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
                  shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth
                  in Section 7.3(c) not to be satisfied, and such condition is
                  incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date.

                  (d) by Parent, if:

                                    (i) (A) the Company Board shall have made an
                  Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) the Company shall have
                  willfully and materially breached (directly or indirectly
                  through any Subsidiary or Representative) Section 5.2 or

                  warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on
                  the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have
                  occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
                  7.2(c) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of
                  being satisfied by the Outside Date.

                  Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

                                    (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant

                  effect with no liability on the part of any party (or any
                  shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
                  representative of such party) to the other party hereto;
                  provided, however, that if such termination shall result from
                  the willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition
                  to the performance of the obligations of the other party or
                  (ii) failure of either party to perform a covenant hereof,
                  such party shall be liable for any and all liabilities and

                  than Section 9.11) and Article X of this Agreement and the
                  provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such
                  termination.

                  assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 50% or

                  applicable, of the Company; or (4) the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries shall have entered into any contract or agreement
                  providing for any of the actions described in any of the
