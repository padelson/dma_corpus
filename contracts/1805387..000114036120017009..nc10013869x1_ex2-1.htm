        to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between ARYA or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and, the Company or any of its Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of whether such
        claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the &#8220;<u>Trust Account Released Claims</u>&#8221;).&#160; The Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its

            agrees that, within thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing Date (the &#8220;<u>Filing Date</u>&#8221;), it will file with the SEC (at its sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the Shares (the &#8220;<u>Registration
              Statement</u>&#8221;), and it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) calendar days (or
            ninety (90) calendar days if the SEC notifies ARYA that it will &#8220;review&#8221; the Registration Statement) following the Filing Date and (ii) ten (10) Business Days after ARYA is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that
            the Registration Statement will not be &#8220;reviewed&#8221; or will not be subject to further review (such earlier date, the &#8220;<u>Effectiveness Date</u>&#8221;). ARYA agrees to cause such Registration Statement, or another shelf registration statement that
            includes the Shares to be sold pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, to remain effective until the earliest of (x) the fourth anniversary of the Closing, (y) the date on which the Investor ceases to hold any Shares issued pursuant to this
            Subscription Agreement, or (z) on the first date on which the Investor is able to sell all of its Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement (or shares received in exchange therefor) under Rule 144 of the Securities Act within 90
            days without limitation as to the amount of such securities that may be sold and without the requirement for ARYA to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(i) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable) (the &#8220;<u>Effectiveness

            withdraw its Shares from the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SEC prevents ARYA from including any or all of the shares proposed to be registered under the Registration Statement due to limitations on the use of
            Rule 415 of the Securities Act for the resale of the Shares by the applicable shareholders or otherwise, such Registration Statement shall register for resale such number of Shares which is equal to the maximum number of Shares as is permitted
            by the SEC. In such event, the number of Shares to be registered for each selling shareholder named in the Registration Statement shall be reduced pro rata among all such selling shareholders. For as long as the Registration Statement shall
            remain effective pursuant to this Section 7(a), ARYA will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) qualify the Shares for listing on the Stock Exchange, and (2) update or amend the Registration Statement as necessary to include the Shares.
            For as long as the Investor holds the Shares, ARYA will use commercially reasonable efforts to file all reports, and provide all customary and reasonable cooperation, necessary to enable the undersigned to resell the Shares pursuant to the
            Registration Statement or Rule 144 of the Securities Act (when Rule 144 of the Securities Act becomes available to the Investor), as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, ARYA may delay or postpone filing of
            such Registration Statement, and from time to time require the Investor not to sell under the Registration Statement or suspend the use or effectiveness of any such Registration Statement, if the board of directors of ARYA determines in good
            faith that either in order for the Registration Statement to not contain a material misstatement or omission, an amendment thereto would be needed, or if such filing or use could materially affect a bona fide business or financing transaction
            of ARYA or would require premature disclosure of information that could materially adversely affect ARYA (each such circumstance, a &#8220;<u>Suspension Event</u>&#8221;); provided, that, (I) ARYA shall not so delay filing or so suspend the use of the
            Registration Statement for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days or more than a total of one hundred-twenty (120) calendar days, in each case in any three hundred sixty (360) day period and (II) ARYA shall use commercially
            reasonable efforts to make such Registration Statement available for the sale by the undersigned of such securities as soon as practicable thereafter. If so directed by ARYA, the Investor will deliver to ARYA or, in the Investor&#8217;s sole
            discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares in the Investor&#8217;s possession; provided, however, that this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares shall not apply (i) to the extent
            the Investor is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (A) in order to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or (B) in accordance with a bona fide pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) to copies stored
            electronically on archival servers as a result of automatic data back-up. ARYA&#8217;s obligations to include the Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement (or shares issued in exchange therefor) for resale in the Registration Statement
            are contingent upon the Investor furnishing in writing to ARYA such information regarding the Investor, the securities of ARYA held by the Investor and the intended method of disposition of such Shares, which shall be limited to
            non-underwritten public offerings, as shall be reasonably requested by ARYA to effect the registration of such Shares, and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as ARYA may reasonably request that are customary of a
            selling stockholder in similar situations. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the contrary, the Investor and the Company may enter into one or more additional agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by the

The Investor hereby irrevocably

              reserves the right to accept or reject the Investor&#8217;s subscription for the Shares for any reason or for no reason, in whole or in part, at any time prior to its acceptance, and the same shall be deemed to be accepted by ARYA only when this
              Subscription Agreement is signed by a duly authorized person by or on behalf of ARYA; ARYA may do so in counterpart form. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that, as a result of the Domestication, the Shares that will be purchased by the
              Investor and issued by ARYA pursuant hereto shall be shares of common stock in a Delaware corporation (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary shares in a Cayman Islands exempted company).</font></div>

              the Transaction. Upon (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 3 below and (b) delivery of written notice from (or on behalf of) ARYA to the Investor (the &#8220;<u>Closing Notice</u>&#8221;), that ARYA reasonably expects all
              conditions to the closing of the Transaction to be satisfied or waived on a date that is not less than five (5) business days from the date on which the Closing Notice is delivered to the Investor, the Investor shall deliver to ARYA, three
              (3) business days prior to the closing date specified in the Closing Notice (the &#8220;<u>Closing Date</u>&#8221;), the Subscription Amount by wire transfer of United States dollars in immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by ARYA in
              the Closing Notice (which account shall not be an escrow account).&#160; On the Closing Date, ARYA shall issue a number of Shares to the Investor set forth on the signature page to this Subscription Agreement and subsequently cause such Shares to
              be registered in book entry form in the name of the Investor on ARYA&#8217;s share register; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that ARYA&#8217;s obligation to issue the Shares to the Investor is contingent upon ARYA having received the Subscription
              Amount in full accordance with this Section 2. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, &#8220;business day&#8221; shall mean a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which commercial banks in New York, New York and Boston, Massachusetts are open

              registered in connection with the consummation of the Transaction, ARYA agrees that, within thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing Date (the &#8220;<u>Filing Date</u>&#8221;), it will file with the SEC (at its sole cost and expense) a registration
              statement registering the resale of the Shares (the &#8220;<u>Registration Statement</u>&#8221;), and it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof,
              but no later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) calendar days (or ninety (90) calendar days if the SEC notifies ARYA that it will &#8220;review&#8221; the Registration Statement) following the Filing Date and (ii) ten (10) Business Days after ARYA is
              notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the Registration Statement will not be &#8220;reviewed&#8221; or will not be subject to further review (such earlier date, the &#8220;<u>Effectiveness Date</u>&#8221;). ARYA agrees to cause such
              Registration Statement, or another shelf registration statement that includes the Shares to be sold pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, to remain effective until the earliest of (x) the fourth anniversary of the Closing, (y) the date on
              which the Investor ceases to hold any Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, or (z) on the first date on which the Investor is able to sell all of its Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement (or shares received
              in exchange therefor) under Rule 144 of the Securities Act within 90 days without limitation as to the amount of such securities that may be sold and without the requirement for ARYA to be in compliance with the current public information
              required under Rule 144(c)(i) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable) (the &#8220;<u>Effectiveness Period</u>&#8221;). The Investor agrees to disclose its ownership to ARYA upon request to assist it in making the determination described above. In no event
              shall the Investor be identified as a statutory underwriter in the Registration Statement unless requested by the SEC; <font style="font-style: italic;">provided</font>, that if the SEC requests that the Investor be identified as a statutory
              underwriter in the Registration Statement, the Investor will have an opportunity to withdraw its Shares from the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SEC prevents ARYA from including any or all of the shares proposed
              to be registered under the Registration Statement due to limitations on the use of Rule 415 of the Securities Act for the resale of the Shares by the applicable shareholders or otherwise, such Registration Statement shall register for resale
              such number of Shares which is equal to the maximum number of Shares as is permitted by the SEC. In such event, the number of Shares to be registered for each selling shareholder named in the Registration Statement shall be reduced pro rata
              among all such selling shareholders. For as long as the Registration Statement shall remain effective pursuant to this Section 7(a), ARYA will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) qualify the Shares for listing on the Stock Exchange,
              and (2) update or amend the Registration Statement as necessary to include the Shares. For as long as the Investor holds the Shares, ARYA will use commercially reasonable efforts to file all reports, and provide all customary and reasonable
              cooperation, necessary to enable the undersigned to resell the Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement or Rule 144 of the Securities Act (when Rule 144 of the Securities Act becomes available to the Investor), as applicable.
              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, ARYA may delay or postpone filing of such Registration Statement, and from time to time require the Investor not to sell under the Registration Statement or suspend the use or
              effectiveness of any such Registration Statement, if the board of directors of ARYA determines in good faith that either in order for the Registration Statement to not contain a material misstatement or omission, an amendment thereto would be
              needed, or if such filing or use could materially affect a bona fide business or financing transaction of ARYA or would require premature disclosure of information that could materially adversely affect ARYA (each such circumstance, a &#8220;<u>Suspension

                Event</u>&#8221;); provided, that, (I) ARYA shall not so delay filing or so suspend the use of the Registration Statement for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days or more than a total of one hundred-twenty (120) calendar days, in
              each case in any three hundred sixty (360) day period and (II) ARYA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such Registration Statement available for the sale by the undersigned of such securities as soon as practicable thereafter.
              If so directed by ARYA, the Investor will deliver to ARYA or, in the Investor&#8217;s sole discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares in the Investor&#8217;s possession; provided, however, that this obligation to deliver or
              destroy all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares shall not apply (i) to the extent the Investor is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (A) in order to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or (B) in
              accordance with a bona fide pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) to copies stored electronically on archival servers as a result of automatic data back-up. ARYA&#8217;s obligations to include the Shares issued pursuant to this
              Subscription Agreement (or shares issued in exchange therefor) for resale in the Registration Statement are contingent upon the Investor furnishing in writing to ARYA such information regarding the Investor, the securities of ARYA held by the
              Investor and the intended method of disposition of such Shares, which shall be limited to non-underwritten public offerings, as shall be reasonably requested by ARYA to effect the registration of such Shares, and shall execute such documents
              in connection with such registration as ARYA may reasonably request that are customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations.</font></div>

              the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the prospectus) not misleading, the undersigned agrees that (1) it will immediately discontinue offers and sales of the Shares under the Registration Statement (excluding, for the

              and receives notice that any post-effective amendment has become effective or unless otherwise notified by ARYA that it may resume such offers and sales, and (2) it will maintain the confidentiality of any information included in such written
              notice delivered by ARYA except (A) for disclosure to the Investor&#8217;s employees, agents and professional advisers who need to know such information and are obligated to keep it confidential, (B) for disclosures to the extent required in order
              to comply with reporting obligations to its limited partners who have agreed to keep such information confidential and (C) as required by law or subpoena.&#160; ARYA shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
              order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement as soon as reasonably practicable.&#160; Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated in clauses (i) through (v) above, except for such times as ARYA is permitted hereunder to
              suspend, and has suspended, the use of a prospectus forming part of a Registration Statement, ARYA shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as soon as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective amendment to such Registration
              Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Shares included therein, such prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a material fact
              or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.</font></div>

              initial public offering. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to ARYA to pay its tax obligations, if any, the cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only for the purposes set
              forth in the Prospectus. For and in consideration of ARYA entering into this Subscription Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Investor hereby irrevocably waives any and all right, title and interest,
              or any claim of any kind it has or may have in the future, in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement; provided,
              however, that nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to limit the Investor&#8217;s right, title, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account by virtue of its record or beneficial ownership of Class A Shares currently outstanding on
              the date hereof, pursuant to a validly exercised redemption right with respect to any such Class A Shares, except to the extent that the Investor has otherwise agreed with ARYA to not exercise such redemption right.</font></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The purpose of the Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#8220;<u>Plan</u>&#8221;) is to provide eligible employees of
        Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;<u>Company</u>&#8221;) and each Designated Subsidiary (as defined in Section 11) with opportunities to purchase shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the &#8220;<u>Common Stock</u>&#8221;).&#160;
        [1.3% of post-closing basic shares outstanding] shares of Common Stock in the aggregate have been approved and reserved for this purpose, plus on January 1, 2021 and each January 1 thereafter until the Plan terminates pursuant to Section 20, the
        number of shares of Common Stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) of the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding
        December 31 or (ii) such lesser number of shares of Common Stock as determined by the Board (as defined in Section 1); provided that the total number of shares of Common Stock that become available for issuance under the Plan may not exceed [10x
        1.3% of post-closing basic shares outstanding].</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The Plan consists of two components: a Code Section 423 component (the &#8220;<u>423 Component</u>&#8221;) and a non-Code Section 423 component (the &#8220;<u>Non-423
          Component</u>&#8221;).&#160; It is intended for the 423 Component to constitute an &#8220;employee stock purchase plan&#8221; within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;<u>Code</u>&#8221;), and the 423 Component shall be
        interpreted in accordance with that intent.&#160; Under the Non-423 Component, which does not qualify as an &#8220;employee stock purchase plan&#8221; within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Code, options will be granted pursuant to rules, procedures or
        sub-plans adopted by the Administrator designed to achieve similar tax, securities, or other objectives for eligible employees as provided by the 423 Component.&#160; Except as otherwise provided herein, the Non-423 Component will operate and be
        administered in the same manner as the 423 Component and will be subject to the same limitations applicable to the 423 Component including, but not limited to, the limitations on purchase set forth in Section 8 of the Plan.</div>

          the person or persons (the &#8220;<u>Administrator</u>&#8221;) appointed by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;<u>Board</u>&#8221;) for such purpose.&#160; The Administrator has authority at any time to: (a) adopt, alter and repeal such rules, guidelines and
          practices for the administration of the Plan and for its own acts and proceedings as it shall deem advisable; (b) interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan; (c) make all determinations it deems advisable for the administration of the Plan,
          including to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws, regulations and procedures for jurisdictions outside the United States; (d) decide all disputes arising in connection with the Plan; and (e) otherwise supervise the administration
          of the Plan.&#160; All interpretations and decisions of the Administrator shall be binding on all persons, including the Company and the Participants.&#160; No member of the Board or individual exercising administrative authority with respect to the Plan
