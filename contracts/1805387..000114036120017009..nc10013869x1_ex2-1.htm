any Party or any other Person (but subject to, in the case of the Company,
_Section 2.4(e)_), each Company Option (whether a Vested Company Option or an

Rollover Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
applicable vesting, expiration and forfeiture provisions) that applied to the
corresponding Company Option immediately  prior to the Effective Time, except
for (i) terms (A) rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any anti-dilution or other similar
provisions that adjust the number of underlying shares that could  become
exercisable subject to the options) or (B) to the extent they conflict with
the ARYA Incentive Equity Plan and (ii) such other immaterial administrative
or ministerial changes as the ARYA Board (or the compensation committee of the

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without  any action of
any Party or any other Person (but subject to, in the case of the Company,
_Section 2.4(e)_), each Unvested Company RSU Award shall cease to have any
rights in respect of the Company Common Shares and shall be canceled in 
exchange for a restricted stock unit award under the ARYA Incentive Equity
Plan (each, a " _Rollover RSU Award_ ") that settles in a number of ARYA
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) in an amount and subject to
such terms and  conditions, in each case, as set forth on the Allocation
Schedule. Each Rollover RSU Award shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including applicable vesting, expiration and forfeiture
provisions) that applied to the corresponding  Unvested Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for (i) terms (A) rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any anti-dilution or other similar provisions that adjust the 
number of underlying shares that could vest subject to the restricted stock

Section 2.5 _Deliverables_

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date  of this
Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, ARYA shall appoint Continental (or its applicable Affiliate) as
an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and enter into an exchange
agent  agreement with the Exchange Agent for the purpose of exchanging

the Adjusted Transaction Share Consideration issuable in respect of such
Company Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(vii)_ and on the terms and subject
to the other conditions set forth in  this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, in the event that Continental is
unable or unwilling to serve as the Exchange Agent, then ARYA and the Company

(d) Each Company Shareholder whose Company Shares have been  converted into
the right to receive a portion of the Adjusted Transaction Share Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(vii)_ shall be entitled to receive the portion of
the Adjusted Transaction Share Consideration to which he, she or it is 
entitled on the date provided in _Section 2.5(e)_ upon (i) surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in the form required by the
Letter of Transmittal), together with the delivery of a properly completed and
duly  executed Letter of Transmittal (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any documents or agreements required by the Letter of Transmittal), to the
Exchange Agent or (ii) in the case of Company Common Shares held in book-entry
form, a properly  completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any documents or agreements required
by the Letter of Transmittal), to the Exchange Agent.

 

(e) If a properly completed and duly executed Letter of  Transmittal,

Day  prior to the Closing Date, then ARYA and the Company shall take all
necessary actions to cause the applicable portion of the Adjusted Transaction
Share Consideration to be issued to the applicable Company Shareholder in

Shareholder in book-entry form within two (2) Business Days after such
delivery.

 

(f) If any portion of the Adjusted Transaction Share  Consideration is to be
issued to a Person other than the Company Shareholder in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or the transferred Company Share in book-entry form is
registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance of the applicable 
portion of the Adjusted Transaction Share Consideration that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Company Share in book-entry form shall be properly
transferred and (ii)  the Person requesting such consideration pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer Taxes required as a result of such consideration
being issued to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Company Share in book-entry form or  establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

 

 

 

 

 

28  


 

 

 

 

(g) No interest will be paid or accrued on the Adjusted  Transaction Share
Consideration (or any portion thereof). From and after the Effective Time,

the Company Shares cancelled and extinguished pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(viii)
and the Pre-Closing Series A Shares cancelled, extinguished and converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(ix)_) shall solely represent the right to receive

(h) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the  Company shall be
closed and there shall be no transfers of Company Shares that were outstanding

the  Adjusted Transaction Share Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 2.5_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to ARYA for the
issuance of the applicable portion of the Adjusted Transaction Share
Consideration, without any  interest thereon. None of ARYA, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, unclaimed  property, escheat, or similar Law.
Any portion of the Adjusted Transaction Share Consideration remaining
unclaimed by the Company Shareholders immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any  Governmental
Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of ARYA free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and
withheld) from any consideration payable pursuant to this  Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all  purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made. The Parties shall cooperate
in good faith to eliminate or reduce any such deduction or withholding
(including through the  request and provision of any statements, forms or
other documents to reduce or eliminate any such deduction or withholding).

of  the Company), a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement or the Ancillary Documents. Each of the
Parties agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement unless it consults
with, in the case of any ARYA Party, the Company, or, in the case of the
Company, ARYA in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Entity, gives, in the case of any ARYA Party, the Company, or,
in  the case of the Company, ARYA, the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meeting or discussion.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement,  in the event
that this Section 5.2 conflicts with any other covenant or agreement in this
_Article 5_ that is intended to specifically address any subject matter, then
such other covenant or agreement shall govern and control solely to the 
extent of such conflict.

 

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the  earlier of the
Closing or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, ARYA,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall each notify the
other in writing promptly after learning of any shareholder demands or other 
shareholder Proceedings (including derivative claims) relating to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any matters relating thereto
(collectively, the " _Transaction Litigation_ ") commenced against, in the
case of ARYA, any of the ARYA  Parties or any of their respective

negotiation, defense and settlement of any such Transaction Litigation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, any other Group
Company or any of their respective Representatives settle or  compromise any
Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of ARYA (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided_ that it shall be
deemed to be reasonable for ARYA to withhold, condition or delay its consent 
if any such settlement or compromise (A) does not provide for a legally
binding, full, unconditional and irrevocable release of each ARYA Party and
Representative that is the subject of such Transaction Litigation, (B)
provides for (x) the payment  of cash any portion of which is payable by any
ARYA Party or Representative thereof or would otherwise constitute an ARYA
Liability or (y) any non-monetary, injunctive, equitable or similar relief

Group Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business
operations of the Group Companies). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Group Companies shall  be required to provide to ARYA or any of its
Representatives any information (i) if and to the extent doing so would (A)
violate any Law to which any Group Company is subject, including any Privacy
Law, (B) result in the disclosure of any trade  secrets of third parties in
breach of any Contract with such third party, (C) violate any legally-binding
obligation of any Group Company with respect to confidentiality, non-

the Company shall, and shall cause the other Group Companies to, use
commercially  reasonable efforts to (x) provide such access as can be
provided (or otherwise convey such information regarding the applicable matter
as can be conveyed) without violating such privilege, doctrine, Contract,
obligation or Law and (y) provide such  information in a manner without
violating such privilege, doctrine, Contract, obligation or Law), or (ii) if

operations of the ARYA Parties). Notwithstanding the foregoing, ARYA shall not
be required to provide,  or cause to be provided to, the Company or any of
its Representatives any information (i) if and to the extent doing so would
(A) violate any Law to which any ARYA Party is subject, (B) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties  in breach of any Contract
with such third party, (C) violate any legally-binding obligation of any ARYA
Party with respect to confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy or (D)

doctrine, Contract, obligation or Law and (y) provide such information in a
manner  without violating such privilege, doctrine, Contract, obligation or
Law), or (ii) if an ARYA Party, on the one hand, and any Group Company, any
Company Non-Party Affiliate or any of their respective Representatives, on the

prior to the Closing, the Company and ARYA or, after the Closing, ARYA;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each Party may make any such announcement or
other communication (i) if such announcement or other communication is
required  by applicable Law, in which case (A) prior to the Closing, the
disclosing Party and its Representatives shall use reasonable best efforts to
consult with the Company, if the disclosing party is any ARYA Party, or ARYA,
if the disclosing party is  the Company, to review such announcement or
communication and the opportunity to comment thereon and the disclosing Party
shall consider such comments in good faith, or (B) after the Closing, the
disclosing Party and its Representatives shall use  reasonable best efforts
to consult with ARYA and the disclosing Party shall consider such comments in

(b) The initial press release concerning this Agreement and  the transactions

promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement on
the day thereof. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, ARYA shall
file a current report on Form 8-K (the " _Signing Filing_ ") with the Signing
Press Release  and a description of this Agreement as required by, and in
compliance with, the Securities Laws, which the Company shall have the
opportunity to review and comment upon prior to filing and ARYA shall consider
such comments in good faith. The  Company, on the one hand, and ARYA, on the
other hand, shall mutually agree upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed by either the Company or ARYA, as applicable)
a press release announcing the consummation of  the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Closing Press Release_ ") prior to the Closing, and,

Section 5.5 _Tax        Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Treatment_.

 

(i) The Parties intend that the Domestication shall constitute  a transaction
treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of
the Code and ARYA shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates to) use
reasonable best efforts to cause it to so qualify. The Parties intend that
the  Merger shall be treated as a transaction that qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, and each Party
shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to so qualify. The Parties  shall file all Tax Returns consistent
with, and take no position inconsistent with (whether in audits, Tax Returns
or otherwise), the treatment described in this Section 5.5(a)(i) unless
required to do so  pursuant to a "determination" that is final within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if, after the date hereof but prior to the time at which the
Required ARYA Shareholder Approval has been  obtained ARYA and the Company
mutually determine in good faith that the Merger is not reasonably expected to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to  restructure
the transactions contemplated hereby (such restructured transactions, the "
_Alternative Transaction Structure_ ") in a manner that is reasonably expected
to cause the Alternative Transaction Structure to so qualify, including by 
adding a second merger to take place immediately after the Merger whereby the
surviving company in the Merger would merge with and into a new limited
liability company that is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of ARYA (" _Newco_ "),
with Newco being the  surviving company in such merger.

 

 

 

 

 

67  


 

 

 

 

(ii) ARYA and the Company hereby adopt  this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368-3(a). From the date hereof through the Closing, and following the
Closing, the Parties shall not, and shall not permit or cause  their
respective Affiliates to, take any action, or knowingly fail to take any
action, which action or failure to act prevents or impedes, or would
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, (A) the Merger qualifying for the
Intended Tax  Treatment, and (B) in the case of ARYA, the Domestication
qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

(iii) If, in connection with the preparation and filing of  the Registration
Statement / Proxy Statement, the SEC requests or requires that tax opinions be
prepared and submitted in such connection, ARYA and the Company shall deliver
to Kirkland and Ellis and Goodwin Procter LLP, respectively, customary  Tax
representation letters satisfactory to its counsel, dated and executed as of
the date the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement shall have been declared
effective by the SEC and such other date(s) as determined reasonably necessary
by such  counsel in connection with the preparation and filing of the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, and, if required, Kirkland and Ellis
LLP shall furnish an opinion, subject to customary assumptions and
limitations, to the effect that the  Intended Tax Treatment should apply to
the Domestication and, if required, Goodwin Procter LLP shall furnish an
opinion, subject to customary assumptions and limitations, to the effect that
the Intended Tax Treatment should apply to the Merger.

 

(b) _Tax Matters Cooperation_. Each of the Parties  shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by another Party, in connection with the filing of
relevant Tax Returns, and any audit or tax proceeding. Such cooperation
shall  include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the
provision (with the right to make copies) of records and information
reasonably relevant to any tax proceeding or audit, making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to  provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder and making available to the
Pre-Closing ARYA Holders information reasonably necessary to compute any
income of any such holder (or its direct or indirect owners)  arising (i) if
applicable, as a result of ARYA's status as a "passive foreign investment
company" within the meaning of Section 1297(a) of the Code or a "controlled
foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code for
any  taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing, including timely
providing (A) a PFIC Annual Information Statement to enable such holders to
make a "Qualifying Electing Fund" election under Section 1295 of the Code for
such taxable period, and  (B) information to enable applicable holders to
report their allocable share of "subpart F" income under Section 951 of the
Code for such taxable period and (ii) under Section 367(b) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder  as a result of the
Domestication.

 

(c) _ARYA Taxable Year_. The Parties  agree to treat the taxable year of ARYA
as ending on the date of the Domestication for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

seek to do any of the foregoing. The Company agrees to (A) notify ARYA
promptly upon receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal by any Group
Company,  and to describe the material terms and conditions of any such
Company Acquisition Proposal in reasonable detail (including the identity of
the Persons making such Company Acquisition Proposal) and (B) keep ARYA
reasonably informed on a current  basis of any modifications to such offer or
information.

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the  Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the ARYA Parties
shall not, and each of them shall cause their Representatives not to, directly

furnishing or disclosing information), facilitate, discuss or negotiate,
directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) with
respect to an ARYA Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish or disclose any non-

Section 5.7 _Preparation of Registration Statement / Proxy Statement_. As
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, ARYA
and the Company shall prepare and mutually agree upon  (such agreement not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by either ARYA or the
Company, as applicable), and ARYA shall file with the SEC, the Registration
Statement / Proxy Statement (it being understood that the Registration 
Statement / Proxy Statement shall include a proxy statement / prospectus of

and other  matters reasonably related to the Transaction Proposals, all in

valid under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this

be construed as a  waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of
the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder
shall not constitute a waiver of  such rights.

WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY PROCEEDING, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER

EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE  PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,

Section 8.16 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines  to accept jurisdiction, any state or federal court within State of
New York, New York County), for the purposes of any Proceeding, claim, demand,
action or cause of action (a) arising under this Agreement or under any
Ancillary Document or (b) in  any way connected with or related or incidental
to the dealings of the Parties in respect of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, and irrevocably  and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any such
court, and further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding has been  brought
in an inconvenient forum. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding claim, demand, action or cause of
action against  such Party (i) arising under this Agreement or under any
Ancillary Document or (ii) in any way connected with or related or incidental
to the dealings of the Parties in respect of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document or any of the transactions  contemplated hereby or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, (A) any claim that such Party is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts as described in this
Section 8.16 for any reason, (B) that such Party or such Party's  property is
exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of  judgment or otherwise) and (C) that (x) the Proceeding, claim,
demand, action or cause of action in any such court is brought against such
Party in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such Proceeding, claim,
demand, action or cause of action  against such Party is improper or (z) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced against such
Party in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail to such  party's respective
address set forth in Section 8.4 shall be effective service of process for any
such Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action.

 

Section 8.17 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law  or equity upon
such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy,  would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their
respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement) in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance and other equitable relief to  prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in each case, without posting a bond or undertaking and without
proof of damages and this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they  are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that  the other parties have an adequate remedy at law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

Section 8.18 _Trust        Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the
final prospectus of ARYA, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-238488) on June 8,
2020 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company acknowledges and agrees and
understands that ARYA has established a  trust account (the " _Trust Account_
") containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and
from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO
(including interest accrued from time to time thereon)  for the benefit of
ARYA's public shareholders (including overallotment shares acquired by ARYA's
underwriters, the " _Public Shareholders_ "), and ARYA may disburse monies
from the Trust Account only in the express circumstances described in the 
Prospectus. For and in consideration of ARYA entering into this Agreement, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself
and its  Representatives that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company nor any of it
Representatives does now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or  to any monies in the Trust Account or
distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim
arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way  to, this
Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between ARYA or any
of its Representatives, on the one hand, and, the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such  claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other
theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred
to hereafter as the " _Trust Account Released Claims_ "). The Company, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its  Representatives, hereby irrevocably waives
any Trust Account Released Claims that it or any of its Representatives may
have against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or
in the future as a result of, or arising out of,  any negotiations, or
Contracts with ARYA or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason
whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of any agreement with ARYA or 
its Affiliates).

Agreement to be  duly executed on its behalf as of the day and year first

SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT

 


 

 

ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp II 
  51 Astor Place, 10th Floor 
  New York, New York 10002

 


 

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 


 

 

This Subscription Agreement (this " _Subscription Agreement_ ") is being
entered into as of the date set forth on the signature page hereto, by and 
between ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp II, a Cayman Islands exempted company,
which shall be domesticated as a Delaware corporation prior to the closing of
the Transaction (as defined herein) (" _ARYA_ "), and the undersigned
subscriber (the " _Investor_ "),       in connection with the Business
Combination Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (as may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Transaction
Agreement_ "), by and among ARYA, Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc., a  Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Cassidy Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Cassidy Merger Sub 1_ "), pursuant to which, among other
things, Cassidy Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company as  the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect to
such merger, becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARYA, on the terms and
subject to the conditions therein (such merger, the " _Transaction_ "). In
connection with the  Transaction, ARYA is seeking commitments from interested
investors to purchase, following the Domestication (as defined below) and
prior to the closing of the Transaction, shares of ARYA's common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (the " _Shares_ "),       in a private placement
for a purchase price of $10.00 per share (the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ ").
On or about the date of this Subscription Agreement, ARYA is entering into
subscription agreements (the " _Other Subscription Agreements_ "  and
together with the Subscription Agreement, the " _Subscription Agreements_ ")
with certain other investors (the " _Other Investors_ " and together with the
Investor, the " _Investors_ "), severally and not jointly, pursuant to which
the  Investors, severally and not jointly, have agreed to purchase on the
closing date of the Transaction, inclusive of the Shares subscribed for by the
Investor, an aggregate amount of up to 32,000,000 Shares, at the Per Share
Purchase Price.

 


 

 

Prior to the closing of the Transaction (and as more fully described in the
Transaction Agreement), ARYA will domesticate as a Delaware corporation in 
accordance with Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and Part XII of the Cayman Islands Companies Law (2020 Revision) (the
" _Domestication_ "). The aggregate purchase price to be paid by the Investor
for the  subscribed Shares (as set forth on the signature page hereto) is
referred to herein as the " _Subscription Amount_." Capitalized terms used but
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Transaction  Agreement.

 


 

 

In connection therewith, and in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the conditions, 
set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, each of the
Investor and ARYA acknowledges and agrees as follows:

 


 

 

1. _Subscription_.

 

_ 
  _

 

a. Subject to Section 1(d), the Investor hereby irrevocably subscribes for
and  agrees to purchase from ARYA the number of Shares set forth on the
signature page of this Subscription Agreement on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for herein. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that ARYA
reserves the right to  accept or reject the Investor's subscription for the
Shares for any reason or for no reason, in whole or in part, at any time prior
to its acceptance, and the same shall be deemed to be accepted by ARYA only
when this Subscription Agreement is  signed by a duly authorized person by or
on behalf of ARYA; ARYA may do so in counterpart form. The Investor
acknowledges and agrees that, as a result of the Domestication, the Shares
that will be purchased by the Investor and issued by ARYA  pursuant hereto
shall be shares of common stock in a Delaware corporation (and not, for the
avoidance of doubt, ordinary shares in a Cayman Islands exempted company).

 


 

 


 

  Confidential

 

 

 


 

 

 


 

 


 

 

b. Between July 7, 2020 and the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to
the  Closing Date (as defined below) (such period of time, the " _Pre-Closing
Series A Financing Period_ "), the Investor may purchase, in one or more
transactions, Company Series A Common Shares and Company Series A-1 Preferred
Shares from the  Company in exchange for cash in an aggregate amount not to
exceed the Pre-Closing Series A Financing Cap (as defined below) in effect as
of such determination time pursuant to, and otherwise on the terms and subject
to conditions set forth in,  the Pre-Closing Series A Purchase Agreement and
any related acknowledgement agreement that is in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to ARYA (acknowledging, for the avoidance of doubt,
that the Acknowledgement Agreement referenced in  Section 6(r) is in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to ARYA), and this Subscription Agreement
(each such purchase of Equity Securities of the Company, a " _Pre-Closing
Series A Financing_ "). Assuming, in the case of ARYA, that the 
representation and warranty of the Investor set forth in Section 6(r) is true
and correct in all respects, (i) ARYA acknowledges and agrees that the
Investor purchased Company Series A Common Shares and Company Series A-1
Preferred Shares from  the Company in exchange for $25,000,000 in cash on
July 8, 2020 (the " _Initial Pre-Closing Series A Financing_ "), and (ii) each
of ARYA and the Investor acknowledge and agree that the Initial Pre-Closing
Series A Financing shall constitute,  and be deemed to be, a Pre-Closing
Series A Financing. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, (A) the "
_Pre-Closing Series A Financing Cap_ " means $25,000,000; _provided_ , that
(x) if the Closing has not occurred on or before  September 15, 2020, then
the Pre-Closing Series A Financing Cap shall be increased to an amount equal
to $37,000,000 on September 16, 2020, and (y) if the Closing has not occurred
on or before the 30-day anniversary of September 16, 2020, then  the Pre-
Closing Series A Financing Cap shall be increased by an additional $12,000,000
on the date of each subsequent 30-day anniversary (e.g., for the 30-day period
commencing October 16, 2020, the Pre-Closing Funding Cap will be an amount
equal  to $49,000,000, and for the 30-day period commencing November 15,
2020, the Pre-Closing Funding Cap will be an amount equal to $61,000,000);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in no event  shall (1) the Pre-Closing Series A Financing Cap exceed
the Subscription Amount or (2) the Investor fund an aggregate amount to the
Company and/or ARYA under this Subscription Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Initial  Pre-Closing Series A Financing) in excess of
the Subscription Amount, (B) the " _Pre-Closing Series A Shares_ " means,
collectively, all of the Company Series A Common Shares and the Company Series
A-1 Preferred Shares purchased by the  Investor as provided in the first
sentence of this Section 1(b) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all of
the Company Series A Common Shares and Company Series A-1 Preferred Shares
purchased by the Investor in respect of the Initial  Pre-Closing Series A
Financing), and (C) the " _Pre-Closing Series A Purchase Price Amount_ " means
the aggregate cash proceeds actually received by the Company in respect of the
Pre-Closing Series A Financings (including, for the avoidance of  doubt and
assuming that the representation and warranty in Section 6(r) is true and
correct in all respects, cash proceeds actually received by the Company in
respect of the Initial Pre-Closing Series A Financing).

 


 

 

c. In order to make a Pre-Closing Series A Financing (other than the Initial 
Pre-Closing Series A Financing), the Investor shall give the Company and ARYA
written notice of its election to make such Pre-Closing Series A Financing
(each, a " _Pre-Closing Series A Financing Notice_ ") at least one (1)
Business Day prior  to the funding of such Pre-Closing Series A Financing,
which notice shall set forth (i) the amount of such Pre-Closing Series A
Financing (which shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, be in excess of the
Pre-Closing Series A Financing Cap in  effect at such time and taking into
account each other Pre-Closing Series A Financing that has been consummated
prior to such time) and (ii) the date of the funding of such Pre-Closing
Series A Financing (which shall, for the avoidance of doubt,  be a date that
is on or prior to the end of the Pre-Closing Series A Financing Period).

 


 

 

d. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the Subscription
Amount  payable by the Investor pursuant to Section 2 shall be reduced by the
Pre-Closing Series A Purchase Price Amount (such reduced Subscription Amount
pursuant to this clause (i), the " _Closing Subscription Amount_ "), (ii) the
number of Shares  issuable to the Investor pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement (as set forth on the signature page hereto) shall be reduced by the
Pre-Closing Series A Share Consideration (such reduced number of Shares
pursuant to this clause (ii), the " _Closing       Shares_ "), (iii)
notwithstanding the reductions to the Subscription Amount and the Shares
issuable to the Investor hereunder pursuant to clause (i) and (ii) of this
Section 1(d), the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, upon the 
cancellation, extinguishment and conversion of the Pre-Closing Series A Shares
into the right to receive the Pre-Closing Series A Share Consideration
pursuant to, and as required by, Section 2.1(b)(ix) of the Transaction
Agreement and the other  applicable provisions of the Transaction Agreement,
the Pre-Closing Series A Share Consideration shall be deemed to be issued on
the same terms and conditions, and with the same rights and obligations, as
the Closing Shares issued hereunder and  (iv) ARYA and its Affiliates shall
not have any liabilities or obligations with respect to, or arising out of,
any Pre-Closing Series A Financing (whether under this Subscription Agreement
or otherwise and including, for the avoidance of doubt,  if the Transaction
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms), except for its
obligation to issue the Pre-Closing Series A Share Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)(ix) and the other applicable provisions of the Transaction 
Agreement if (and only if) the First Merger Effective Time occurs and the
Closing Subscription Amount is funded in full in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

 

  Confidential

 

 


   


 

 

2. _Closing_. The closing of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby (the  " _Closing_ ") is contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the Transaction. The Closing shall occur on the date of, and substantially concurrently with and conditioned upon the effectiveness of, the Transaction.

concept exists in such jurisdiction). ARYA has all power (corporate or
otherwise) and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct

issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not have been issued in
violation of or subject to any  preemptive or similar rights created under
ARYA's certificate of incorporation (as amended to the Closing Date) or under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 


 

 

c. This Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by  ARYA and, assuming that this Subscription Agreement constitutes

is enforceable against ARYA in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited or otherwise affected  by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting
the rights of creditors generally, or (ii) principles of equity, whether
considered at law or equity.

 


 

 

d. The issuance and sale of the Shares and the compliance by ARYA with all of
the  provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach
or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the  creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of ARYA or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan agreement, lease, license or other agreement  or instrument to
which ARYA or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which ARYA or any of
its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of ARYA is
subject that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse  effect
on the business, financial condition or results of operations of ARYA and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Material Adverse Effect_ ") or materially
affect the validity of the Shares or the legal authority of ARYA to comply
in  all material respects with the terms of this Subscription Agreement; (ii)
result in any violation of the provisions of the organizational documents of
ARYA; or (iii) result in any violation of any statute or any judgment, order,

material respects with this Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

e. As of their respective dates, all reports (the " _SEC Reports_ ")
required  to be filed by ARYA with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "
_Securities Act_ ") and the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
" _Exchange Act_ ") and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, and none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a  material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
financial statements of ARYA included in the SEC Reports comply  in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing
and fairly present in all material respects the financial position of ARYA as
of and  for the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows

ARYA, other than (1) as  set forth in the SEC Reports and (2) as contemplated
by the Transaction Agreement.

 


 

 

i. The issued and outstanding Class A Shares are registered pursuant to

investigation pending or, to the knowledge of ARYA, threatened against the
ARYA by the Stock Exchange or  the SEC, respectively, to prohibit or
terminate the listing of the Class A Shares or, when issued, the Delaware
Common Shares, or to deregister the Class A Shares or, when registered and
issued in connection with the Domestication, the Delaware  Common Shares,
under the Exchange Act. ARYA has taken no action that is designed to terminate
the registration of the Class A Shares under the Exchange Act, other than in
connection with the Domestication and subsequent registration under the 
Exchange Act of the Delaware Common Shares.

investment discretion with respect to each  such account, and the full power
and authority to make the acknowledgements, representations and agreements
herein on behalf of each owner of each such account, and (iii) is not
acquiring the Shares with a view to, or for offer or sale in  connection

restrictions, the Investor may not be able to readily offer, resell, transfer,
pledge or otherwise dispose of the Shares and may be required to bear the
financial risk of an  investment in the Shares for an indefinite period of
time. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Shares will not be
eligible for offer, resale, transfer, pledge or disposition pursuant to Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act  until at least one year from the
date that ARYA files a Current Report on Form 8-K following the Closing Date
that includes the "Form 10" information required under applicable SEC rules

advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, transfer,
pledge or disposition of any of the Shares.

 


 

 

c. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Investor is purchasing the
Shares  from ARYA. The Investor further acknowledges that there have been no
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made to the Investor by
or on behalf of ARYA, the Company, any of their respective Affiliates or any

representatives of any of the foregoing or any other person or entity,
expressly or by implication, other than those representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of ARYA expressly set  forth in Section 5 of this
Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

d. The Investor's acquisition and holding of the Shares will not constitute
or  result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, Section 4975 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any applicable similar law.

 


 

 

 

  Confidential

if any, have deemed necessary to make an investment decision with respect to
the Shares.

 


 

 

f. The Investor became aware of this offering of the Shares solely by means
of  direct contact between the Investor and ARYA, the Company or a
representative of ARYA or the Company, and the Shares were offered to the

or a representative of ARYA or  the Company. The Investor did not become

were not offered by any form of general solicitation or  general advertising
and (ii) are not being offered in a manner involving a public offering under,

any control  persons, officers, directors, employees, partners, agents or
representatives of any of the foregoing), other than the representations and
warranties of ARYA contained in Section 5 of this Subscription Agreement, in
making its investment or  decision to invest in ARYA.

 


 

 

g. The Investor acknowledges that it is aware that there are substantial
risks  incident to the purchase and ownership of the Shares, including those
set forth in ARYA's filings with the SEC. The Investor has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks  of an investment in the Shares, and the Investor has
sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as the Investor has considered
necessary to make an informed investment decision.

 


 

 

h. Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), the Investor has
analyzed  and considered the risks of an investment in the Shares and

Investor acknowledges specifically that a possibility of total loss exists.

 


 

 

i. In making its decision to purchase the Shares, the Investor has relied
solely  upon independent investigation made by the Investor. Without limiting

employees, partners, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing
concerning ARYA, the Company, the Transaction, the Transaction Agreement, this
Subscription Agreement or the  transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
the Shares or the offer and sale of the Shares.

 


 

 

j. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that no federal or state agency has
passed  upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Shares or made any
findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

 


 

 

k. The Investor, if not an individual, has been duly formed or incorporated
and is  validly existing and is in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation or incorporation, with power and authority to enter
into, deliver and perform its obligations under this Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

l. The execution, delivery and performance by the Investor of this
Subscription  Agreement are within the powers of the Investor, have been duly
authorized and will not constitute or result in a breach or default under or
conflict with any order, ruling or regulation of any court or other tribunal
or of any governmental  commission or agency, or any agreement or other
undertaking, to which the Investor is a party or by which the Investor is
bound, and, if the Investor is not an individual, will not violate any
provisions of the Investor's organizational  documents, including, without
limitation, its incorporation or formation papers, bylaws, indenture of trust
or partnership or operating agreement, as may be applicable. The signature on
this Subscription Agreement is genuine, and the signatory,  if the Investor

" _PATRIOT Act_ "), and its implementing  regulations (collectively, the "
_BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), the Investor maintains policies and procedures
reasonably designed to comply with applicable obligations under the
BSA/PATRIOT Act. To the extent required, it maintains policies and 
procedures reasonably designed for the screening of its investors against the

7. _Registration Rights_.

 

_ 
  _

 

 

 

(a) In the event that the Shares are not registered in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction, ARYA  agrees that, within thirty (30)
calendar days after the Closing Date (the " _Filing Date_ "), it will file
with the SEC (at its sole cost and expense) a registration statement
registering the resale of the Shares (the " _Registration  Statement_ "), and
it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof,
but no later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) calendar days (or  ninety
(90) calendar days if the SEC notifies ARYA that it will "review" the
Registration Statement) following the Filing Date and (ii) ten (10) Business
Days after ARYA is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by
the SEC that  the Registration Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not
be subject to further review (such earlier date, the " _Effectiveness Date_
"). ARYA agrees to cause such Registration Statement, or another shelf
registration statement that  includes the Shares to be sold pursuant to this
Subscription Agreement, to remain effective until the earliest of (x) the
fourth anniversary of the Closing, (y) the date on which the Investor ceases
to hold any Shares issued pursuant to this  Subscription Agreement, or (z) on
the first date on which the Investor is able to sell all of its Shares issued
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement (or shares received in exchange
therefor) under Rule 144 of the Securities Act within 90  days without
limitation as to the amount of such securities that may be sold and without
the requirement for ARYA to be in compliance with the current public
information required under Rule 144(c)(i) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable)
(the " _Effectiveness   Period_ "). The Investor agrees to disclose its
ownership to ARYA upon request to assist it in making the determination
described above. In no event shall the Investor be identified as a statutory
underwriter in the Registration Statement  unless requested by the SEC;
provided, that if the SEC requests that the Investor be identified as a
statutory underwriter in the Registration Statement, the Investor will have an
opportunity to  withdraw its Shares from the Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SEC prevents ARYA from including any or
all of the shares proposed to be registered under the Registration Statement
due to limitations on the use of  Rule 415 of the Securities Act for the
resale of the Shares by the applicable shareholders or otherwise, such
Registration Statement shall register for resale such number of Shares which
is equal to the maximum number of Shares as is permitted  by the SEC. In such
event, the number of Shares to be registered for each selling shareholder
named in the Registration Statement shall be reduced pro rata among all such
selling shareholders. For as long as the Registration Statement shall  remain
effective pursuant to this Section 7(a), ARYA will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (1) qualify the Shares for listing on the Stock Exchange, and (2)
update or amend the Registration Statement as necessary to include the
Shares.  For as long as the Investor holds the Shares, ARYA will use
commercially reasonable efforts to file all reports, and provide all customary
and reasonable cooperation, necessary to enable the undersigned to resell the
Shares pursuant to the  Registration Statement or Rule 144 of the Securities
Act (when Rule 144 of the Securities Act becomes available to the Investor),
as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, ARYA
may delay or postpone filing of  such Registration Statement, and from time
to time require the Investor not to sell under the Registration Statement or
suspend the use or effectiveness of any such Registration Statement, if the
board of directors of ARYA determines in good  faith that either in order for
the Registration Statement to not contain a material misstatement or omission,
an amendment thereto would be needed, or if such filing or use could
materially affect a bona fide business or financing transaction  of ARYA or
would require premature disclosure of information that could materially
adversely affect ARYA (each such circumstance, a " _Suspension Event_ ");
provided, that, (I) ARYA shall not so delay filing or so suspend the use of
the  Registration Statement for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive
days or more than a total of one hundred-twenty (120) calendar days, in each
case in any three hundred sixty (360) day period and (II) ARYA shall use
commercially  reasonable efforts to make such Registration Statement
available for the sale by the undersigned of such securities as soon as
practicable thereafter. If so directed by ARYA, the Investor will deliver to
ARYA or, in the Investor's sole  discretion destroy, all copies of the
prospectus covering the Shares in the Investor's possession; provided,
however, that this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of the
prospectus covering the Shares shall not apply (i) to the extent  the
Investor is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (A) in order to
comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or (B) in accordance
with a bona fide pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) to copies
stored  electronically on archival servers as a result of automatic data
back-up. ARYA's obligations to include the Shares issued pursuant to this
Subscription Agreement (or shares issued in exchange therefor) for resale in
the Registration Statement  are contingent upon the Investor furnishing in
writing to ARYA such information regarding the Investor, the securities of
ARYA held by the Investor and the intended method of disposition of such
Shares, which shall be limited to  non-underwritten public offerings, as
shall be reasonably requested by ARYA to effect the registration of such
Shares, and shall execute such documents in connection with such registration
as ARYA may reasonably request that are customary of a  selling stockholder
in similar situations. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the
contrary, the Investor and the Company may enter into one or more additional
agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by the 
Transaction Agreement that provide for methods of distribution of the Shares
that include underwritten public offerings.

(b) At its expense ARYA shall advise the Investor within two (2) Business
Days: (i) when a  Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto has become effective; (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to any Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein
or for additional information;  (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for such purpose; (iv) of the receipt by ARYA of
any notification with respect to the suspension  of the qualification of the
Shares included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and (v) subject to the
provisions in this Subscription Agreement, of the occurrence of any  event
that requires the making of any changes in any Registration Statement or
prospectus so that, as of such date, the statements therein are not misleading
and do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to  make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading.
Upon receipt of any written notice from ARYA (which notice shall not contain
any material non-public  information regarding ARYA) of the happening of any
of the foregoing or of a Suspension Event during the period that the
Registration Statement is effective or if as a result of a Suspension Event
the Registration Statement or related  prospectus contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made (in the case of  the prospectus) not
misleading, the undersigned agrees that (1) it will immediately discontinue
offers and sales of the Shares under the Registration Statement (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, sales conducted pursuant to Rule 144) until  the
undersigned receives copies of a supplemental or amended prospectus (which
ARYA agrees to promptly prepare) that corrects the misstatement(s) or
omission(s) referred to above and receives notice that any post-effective
amendment has become  effective or unless otherwise notified by ARYA that it
may resume such offers and sales, and (2) it will maintain the confidentiality
of any information included in such written notice delivered by ARYA except
(A) for disclosure to the  Investor's employees, agents and professional
advisers who need to know such information and are obligated to keep it
confidential, (B) for disclosures to the extent required in order to comply
with reporting obligations to its limited partners  who have agreed to keep
such information confidential and (C) as required by law or subpoena. ARYA
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement  as soon as
reasonably practicable. Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated in
clauses (i) through (v) above, except for such times as ARYA is permitted
hereunder to suspend, and has suspended, the use of a prospectus forming part
of a  Registration Statement, ARYA shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to as soon as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
prospectus, or file any other  required document so that, as thereafter
delivered to purchasers of the Shares included therein, such prospectus will
not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements  therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Indemnification.

    
---|--- 
    


 

 

 

(i) ARYA agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent permitted by
law,  the Investor, its directors, and officers, employees, and agents, and
each person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act) and each affiliate of the Investor (within the
meaning of Rule 405 under  the Securities Act) from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, any attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with
defending or investigating any such action or claim)  caused by any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, prospectus included in any Registration Statement (" _Prospectus_
") or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement  thereto
or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except
insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in
writing  to ARYA by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use therein.

 


 

 

(ii) The Investor agrees, severally and not jointly with any other person that
is  a party to the Other Subscription Agreements, to indemnify and hold
harmless ARYA, its directors and officers and agents and each person who
controls ARYA (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities  and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material
fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary
Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement  thereto or any omission of
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so 
furnished in writing by the Investor expressly for use therein. In no event
shall the liability of the Investor be greater in amount than the dollar
amount of the net proceeds received by such Investor upon the sale of the
Shares purchased  pursuant to this Subscription Agreement giving rise to such
indemnification obligation.

 


 

 

 

  Confidential

 

 


  
   

(iii) Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (1) give prompt
written  notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the extent
such failure has not  prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (2) permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the
indemnifying party shall not be subject  to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its consent. An indemnifying party who
elects not to assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all  parties indemnified by
such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of legal counsel to any indemnified party a conflict of interest
exists between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified 
parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the
consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the
payment of money (and  such money is so paid by the indemnifying party
pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such indemnified party of a release from  all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation.

 


 

 

(iv) The indemnification provided for under this Subscription Agreement
shall  remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made
by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director, employee,
agent, affiliate or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall
survive the transfer of  the Shares purchased pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement.

 


 

 

(v) If the indemnification provided under this Section 7(c) from the
indemnifying  party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall  contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the  indemnified party, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any  untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and  indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable
by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above
shall be deemed to  include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any
legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the  meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this Section
7(c) from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 


 

 

8. _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void and  of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and time as the  Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (b) upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto and the Company to terminate this Subscription Agreement, (c) ARYA's notification to the Investor in writing  that it has, with the written consent of the Company, abandoned its plans to move forward with the Transaction and/or terminated the Investor's obligations with respect to the subscription without the delivery of the Shares having occurred, (d)  the Termination Date (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), if the Closing has not occurred by such date, or (e) if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 3 of this Subscription Agreement are not satisfied or waived, or are not  capable of being satisfied, on or prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement will not be and are not consummated at the Closing (the termination events described in clauses (a)-(e)  above, collectively, the " _Termination Events_ "); _provided_ that, subject to Section 1(d)(iv), nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of termination, and each party will be  entitled to any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from any such willful breach. ARYA shall notify the Investor of the termination of the Transaction Agreement promptly after the termination of such  agreement. Upon the occurrence of any Termination Event, this Subscription Agreement shall be void and of no further effect and any monies paid by the Investor to ARYA in connection herewith shall promptly (and in any event within one Business  Day) following the Termination Event be returned to the Investor (it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that none of the monies received by the Company in respect of any Pre-Closing Series A Financing shall be deemed to be  monies paid by the Investor to ARYA for purposes of this Section 8 or otherwise).

9. _Trust Account Waiver_. The Investor acknowledges that ARYA is a blank  check company with the powers and privileges to effect a merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination involving ARYA and one or more businesses or assets. The Investor further acknowledges that, as described in ARYA's  prospectus relating to its initial public offering dated June 4, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at www.sec.gov, substantially all of ARYA's assets consist of the cash proceeds of ARYA's initial public offering and private placement of  its securities, and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the benefit of ARYA, its public shareholders and the underwriters of ARYA's initial public offering. Except with  respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to ARYA to pay its tax obligations, if any, the cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only for the purposes set forth in the Prospectus. For and in  consideration of ARYA entering into this Subscription Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Investor hereby irrevocably waives any and all right, title and interest, or any claim of any kind it has or may  have in the future, in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 9 shall  be deemed to limit the Investor's right, title, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account by virtue of its record or beneficial ownership of Class A Shares currently outstanding on the date hereof, pursuant to a validly exercised  redemption right with respect to any such Class A Shares, except to the extent that the Investor has otherwise agreed with ARYA to not exercise such redemption right.

 


 

 

10. _Miscellaneous_.

 


 

 

a. Neither this Subscription Agreement nor any rights that may accrue to the 
Investor hereunder (other than the Shares acquired hereunder, if any) may be
transferred or assigned.

 


 

 

b. ARYA may request from the Investor such additional information as ARYA may
deem  necessary to register the resale of the Shares and evaluate the
eligibility of the Investor to acquire the Shares, and the Investor shall
provide such information as may reasonably be requested. The Investor
acknowledges that ARYA may file a copy  of this Subscription Agreement with
the SEC as an exhibit to a periodic report or a registration statement of
ARYA.

 


 

 

c. The Investor acknowledges that ARYA, the Company, the Placement Agents
and  others will rely on the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements,
representations and warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement. Prior
to the Closing, the Investor agrees to promptly notify ARYA, the Company and
the Placement Agents  if any of the acknowledgments, understandings,
agreements, representations and warranties set forth in Section 6 above are no
longer accurate. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that each purchase by
the Investor of Shares from ARYA will  constitute a reaffirmation of the
acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations and warranties
herein (as modified by any such notice) by the Investor as of the time of such
purchase.

 


 

 

d. ARYA, the Company and the Placement Agents are each entitled to rely upon
this  Subscription Agreement and each is irrevocably authorized to produce
this Subscription Agreement or a copy hereof to any interested party in any
administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the
matters covered hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing clause
of this Section 10(d) shall not give the Company or the Placement Agents any
rights other than those expressly set forth herein and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and for the avoidance  of doubt, in no event
shall the Company be entitled to rely on any of the representations and
warranties of ARYA set forth in this Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

e. All of the agreements, representations and warranties made by each party
hereto  in this Subscription Agreement shall survive the Closing.

 


 

 

f. This Subscription Agreement may not be modified, waived or terminated
(other  than pursuant to the terms of Section 8 above) except by an
instrument in writing, signed by each of the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no modification or waiver by ARYA of the provisions of this
Subscription Agreement  shall be effective without the prior written consent
of the Company (other than modifications or waivers that are solely
ministerial in nature or otherwise immaterial and do not affect any economic
or any other material term of this Subscription  Agreement). No failure or
delay of either party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to 
enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The
rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights  or remedies that they would otherwise have
hereunder.

g. This Subscription Agreement (including the schedule hereto) constitutes
the  entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as set forth in
Section 8, Section 10(c),  Section 10(d), Section 10(f), this Section 10(g)
and the last sentence of Section 10(k) with respect to the persons
specifically referenced therein, this Subscription Agreement shall not confer
any rights or remedies upon any person other than  the parties hereto, and
their respective successor and assigns, and the parties hereto acknowledge
that such persons so referenced are third party beneficiaries of this
Subscription Agreement for the purposes of, and to the extent of, the rights 
granted to them, if any, pursuant to such provisions.

 


 

 

h. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subscription Agreement shall be 
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs,

assigns, and the agreements, representations, warranties, covenants and
acknowledgments  contained herein shall be deemed to be made by, and be
binding upon, such heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns.

 


 

 

i. If any provision of this Subscription Agreement shall be adjudicated by a
court  of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Subscription Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby
and shall continue in full  force and effect.

 


 

 

j. This Subscription Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts 
(including by facsimile or electronic mail or in .pdf) and by different
parties in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all parties
hereto had signed the same document. All counterparts so executed and
delivered shall be construed  together and shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 


 

 

k. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in  the event that any of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions  to prevent breaches of this Subscription
Agreement, without posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages,
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Subscription
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to  which such party is
entitled at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to seek to
specifically enforce the Investor's obligations to fund the Closing 
Subscription Amount and the provisions of the Subscription Agreement of which
the Company is an express third party beneficiary, in each case, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 


 

 

l. Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder to be given to

set forth on the  signature page hereto, and shall be deemed to be given and

undeliverable or other rejection notice, if sent by email, or (iii) three (3)
business days after the date of  mailing to the address below or to such
other address or addresses as the Investor may hereafter designate by notice
to ARYA.

Upon  the issuance of the Disclosure Document, to the actual knowledge of ARYA, the Investor shall not be in possession of any material, non-public information received from ARYA or any of its officers, directors, or employees or agents, and the  Investor shall no longer be subject to any confidentiality or similar obligations under any current agreement, whether written or oral with ARYA or any of its affiliates, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement.

SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT

 


 

 

ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp II

 

51 Astor Place, 10th Floor

 

New York, New York 10002

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 


 

 

This Subscription Agreement (this " _Subscription Agreement_ ") is being
entered into as of the date set forth on the signature page hereto, by  and
between ARYA Sciences Acquisition Corp II, a Cayman Islands exempted company,
which shall be domesticated as a Delaware corporation prior to the closing of
the Transaction (as defined herein) (" _ARYA_ "), and the undersigned
subscriber  (the " _Investor_ "), in connection with the Business Combination
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (as may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Transaction Agreement_ "), by and
among ARYA,  Cerevel Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Cassidy Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Cassidy
Merger Sub 1_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, Cassidy Merger Sub 1
will merge with and into  the Company, with the Company as the surviving
company in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of ARYA, on the terms and subject to the conditions
therein (such merger, the " _Transaction_ ").   In connection with the
Transaction, ARYA is seeking commitments from interested investors to
purchase, following the Domestication (as defined below) and prior to the
closing of the Transaction, shares of ARYA's common stock, par value $0.0001 
per share (the " _Shares_ "), in a private placement for a purchase price of
$10.00 per share (the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ "). On or about the date of
this Subscription Agreement, ARYA is entering into subscription agreements
(the " _Other   Subscription Agreements_ " and together with the
Subscription Agreement, the " _Subscription Agreements_ ") with certain other
investors (the " _Other Investors_ " and together with the Investor, the "
_Investors_ "), severally and  not jointly, pursuant to which the Investors,
severally and not jointly, have agreed to purchase on the closing date of the
Transaction, inclusive of the Shares subscribed for by the Investor, an
aggregate amount of up to 32,000,000 Shares, at  the Per Share Purchase
Price.

 


 

 

Prior to the closing of the Transaction (and as more fully described in the
Transaction Agreement), ARYA will domesticate as a Delaware corporation  in
accordance with Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and Part XII of the Cayman Islands Companies Law (2020 Revision) (the
" _Domestication_ "). The aggregate purchase price to be paid by the Investor
for  the subscribed Shares (as set forth on the signature page hereto) is
referred to herein as the " _Subscription Amount_."

 


 

 

In connection therewith, and in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the  conditions,
set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, each of the
Investor and ARYA acknowledges and agrees as follows:

 


 

 

1. _Subscription_. The Investor hereby irrevocably  subscribes for and agrees to purchase from ARYA the number of Shares set forth on the signature page of this Subscription Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that ARYA  reserves the right to accept or reject the Investor's subscription for the Shares for any reason or for no reason, in whole or in part, at any time prior to its acceptance, and the same shall be deemed to be accepted by ARYA only when this  Subscription Agreement is signed by a duly authorized person by or on behalf of ARYA; ARYA may do so in counterpart form. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that, as a result of the Domestication, the Shares that will be purchased by the  Investor and issued by ARYA pursuant hereto shall be shares of common stock in a Delaware corporation (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary shares in a Cayman Islands exempted company).

 


 

 

2. _Closing_. The closing of the sale of the Shares  contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") is contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the Transaction. The Closing shall occur on the date of, and substantially concurrently with and conditioned upon the effectiveness of,  the Transaction. Upon (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 3 below and (b) delivery of written notice from (or on behalf of) ARYA to the Investor (the " _Closing Notice_ "), that ARYA reasonably expects all  conditions to the closing of the Transaction to be satisfied or waived on a date that is not less than five (5) business days from the date on which the Closing Notice is delivered to the Investor, the Investor shall deliver to ARYA, three  (3) business days prior to the closing date specified in the Closing Notice (the " _Closing Date_ "), the Subscription Amount by wire transfer of United States dollars in immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by ARYA in  the Closing Notice (which account shall not be an escrow account). On the Closing Date, ARYA shall issue a number of Shares to the Investor set forth on the signature page to this Subscription Agreement and subsequently cause such Shares to  be registered in book entry form in the name of the Investor on ARYA's share register; _provided_ , _however_ , that ARYA's obligation to issue the Shares to the Investor is contingent upon ARYA having received the Subscription  Amount in full accordance with this Section 2. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, "business day" shall mean a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which commercial banks in New York, New York and Boston, Massachusetts are open  for the general transaction of business.

Closing Date, and consummation of the Closing shall constitute a reaffirmation
by ARYA of each of the representations and warranties of ARYA contained in 
this Subscription Agreement as of the Closing Date; and

 


 

 

(ii) ARYA shall have performed, satisfied  and complied in all material
respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by the

  Confidential

 

 


 

 

5. _ARYA Representations and Warranties_. ARYA  represents and warrants to the Investor that:

 


 

 

a. ARYA is an exempted company duly incorporated, validly  existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands (to the extent such concept
exists in such jurisdiction). ARYA has all power (corporate or otherwise) and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its  business
as presently conducted and to enter into, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Subscription Agreement. As of the Closing Date, following the
Domestication, ARYA will be duly incorporated, validly existing as a
corporation  and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

 


 

 

b. As of the Closing Date, the Shares will be duly authorized  and, when
issued and delivered to the Investor against full payment therefor in
accordance with the terms of this Subscription Agreement, the Shares will be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not have been issued
in  violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar rights created under
ARYA's certificate of incorporation (as amended to the Closing Date) or under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 


 

 

c. This Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized,  executed and
delivered by ARYA and, assuming that this Subscription Agreement constitutes
the valid and binding agreement of the Investor, this Subscription Agreement
is enforceable against ARYA in accordance with its terms, except as may be 
limited or otherwise affected by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting
the rights of creditors generally, or (ii) principles of equity, whether
considered at law  or equity.

 


 

 

d. The issuance and sale of the Shares and the compliance by  ARYA with all
of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach
or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a  default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of ARYA or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan  agreement, lease, license or other agreement or instrument to
which ARYA or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which ARYA or any of
its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of ARYA is
subject that would  reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the business, financial condition or results of operations of ARYA and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Material Adverse Effect_ ") or materially
affect the validity of  the Shares or the legal authority of ARYA to comply
in all material respects with the terms of this Subscription Agreement; (ii)
result in any violation of the provisions of the organizational documents of
ARYA; or (iii) result in any  violation of any statute or any judgment,
order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body,
domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over ARYA or any of their properties
that would reasonably be expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect or
materially affect the validity of the Shares or the legal authority of ARYA to
comply in all material respects with this Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

e. As of their respective dates, all reports (the " _SEC  Reports_ ")
required to be filed by ARYA with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the " _Securities 
Act_ ") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange
Act_ ") and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and
none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a
material  fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of ARYA  included in the SEC Reports comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing and fairly
present in all material respects  the financial position of ARYA as of and
for the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal,
year-end audit adjustments. A copy of each SEC  Report is available to the
Investor via the SEC's EDGAR system. There are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received by ARYA from the staff of the Division of
Corporation Finance of the SEC with respect to any of the  SEC Reports.

 


 

 

f. Other than the Other Subscription Agreements, the  Transaction Agreement
and any other agreement expressly contemplated by the Transaction Agreement,
ARYA has not entered into any side letter or similar agreement with any
investor in connection with such investor's direct or indirect  investment in
ARYA or with any other investor, and such Other Subscription Agreements have
not been amended in any material respect following the date of this
Subscription Agreement.

without limitation, the issuance of the Shares), other than (i) filings with
the SEC, (ii) filings required by applicable state securities laws, (iii)
filings  required by the Nasdaq, or such other applicable stock exchange on

outstanding as set forth in Section 4.6(b) of the Transaction Agreement,
subject in all respects to the assumptions referenced  in such section, and
(3) 4,983,333 redeemable warrants and 166,333 private placement warrants to
acquire Delaware Common Shares will be outstanding. All (A) issued and
outstanding Class A Shares and Class B Shares have been duly authorized  and

warrants have been duly authorized and validly issued. Except as set forth
above and pursuant to the Other Subscription Agreements, the Transaction
Agreement and  the other agreements and arrangements referred to therein, as
of the date hereof, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights
to subscribe for, purchase or acquire from ARYA any Class A Shares, Class B
Shares or other equity  interests in ARYA, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for such equity interests. As of the date hereof,
ARYA has no subsidiaries, other than Cassidy Merger Sub 1, and does not own,
directly or indirectly, interests  or investments (whether equity or debt) in
any person, whether incorporated or unincorporated. There are no stockholder
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which ARYA
is a party or by which it is bound relating  to the voting of any securities
of ARYA, other than (1) as set forth in the SEC Reports and (2) as
contemplated by the Transaction Agreement.

 


 

 

i. The issued and outstanding Class A Shares are registered  pursuant to
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and are listed for trading on the Stock
Exchange. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of ARYA, threatened against the
ARYA  by the Stock Exchange or the SEC, respectively, to prohibit or
terminate the listing of the Class A Shares or, when issued, the Delaware
Common Shares, or to deregister the Class A Shares or, when registered and
issued in connection with the  Domestication, the Delaware Common Shares,
under the Exchange Act. ARYA has taken no action that is designed to terminate
the registration of the Class A Shares under the Exchange Act, other than in
connection with the Domestication and  subsequent registration under the
Exchange Act of the Delaware Common Shares.

 


 

 

j. Assuming the accuracy of the Investor's representations  and warranties
set forth in Section 6, no registration under the Securities Act is required

Shares (i) were not offered by any form of general solicitation or general 
advertising and (ii) are not being offered in a manner involving a public
offering under, or in a distribution in violation of, the Securities Act, or
any state securities laws.

 


 

 

k. Except for such matters as have not had and would not be  reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
there is no (i) action, suit, claim or other proceeding, in each case by or
before any governmental authority pending, or, to the knowledge of ARYA, 
threatened against ARYA or (ii) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order
of any governmental entity or arbitrator outstanding against ARYA.

 


 

 

l. Other than the Placement Agents (as defined below), ARYA  has not engaged
any broker, finder, commission agent, placement agent or arranger in

Shares  other than to the Placement Agents.

 


 

 

  Confidential

 

 

6. _Investor Representations and Warranties_. The  Investor represents and warrants to ARYA that:

 


 

 

a. The Investor (i) is a "qualified institutional buyer" (as  defined in Rule

investment  discretion with respect to each such account, and the full power
and authority to make the acknowledgements, representations and agreements
herein on behalf of each owner of each such account, and (iii) is not
acquiring the Shares with a view  to, or for offer or sale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act (and shall

b. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Shares are  being offered in
a transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of the
Securities Act and that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Shares may not
be  offered, resold, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of by the
Investor absent an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
except (i) to ARYA or a subsidiary thereof, (ii) to non-U.S. persons pursuant
to offers and  sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning
of Regulation S under the Securities Act or (iii) pursuant to another
applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
and in each of clauses (i) and  (iii) in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of the states and other jurisdictions of the United States,
and that any certificates representing the Shares shall contain a restrictive
legend to such effect. The Investor acknowledges  and agrees that the Shares
will be subject to transfer restrictions and, as a result of these transfer
restrictions, the Investor may not be able to readily offer, resell, transfer,
pledge or otherwise dispose of the Shares and may be  required to bear the
financial risk of an investment in the Shares for an indefinite period of
time. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Shares will not be
eligible for offer, resale, transfer, pledge or disposition pursuant to Rule 
144 promulgated under the Securities Act until at least one year from the date
that ARYA files a Current Report on Form 8-K following the Closing Date that
includes the "Form 10" information required under applicable SEC rules and 
regulations. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that it has been advised to
consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, transfer, pledge or
disposition of any of the Shares.

 


 

 

c. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Investor is  purchasing the
Shares from ARYA. The Investor further acknowledges that there have been no
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made to the Investor by
or on behalf of ARYA, the Company, any of their respective affiliates or  any
control persons, officers, directors, employees, partners, agents or
representatives of any of the foregoing or any other person or entity,
expressly or by implication, other than those representations, warranties,
covenants and  agreements of ARYA expressly set forth in Section 5 of this
Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

d. The Investor's acquisition and holding of the Shares will  not constitute
or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, Section 4975 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any applicable similar 
law.

 


 

 

e. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Investor has  received such
information as the Investor deems necessary in order to make an investment
decision with respect to the Shares, including, with respect to ARYA, the
Transaction and the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Investor acknowledges that he,
she or it has reviewed the SEC Reports. The Investor acknowledges and agrees
that the Investor and the Investor's professional advisor(s), if any, have had
the full  opportunity to ask such questions, receive such answers and obtain
such information as the Investor and such Investor's professional advisor(s),
if any, have deemed necessary to make an investment decision with respect to
the Shares.

 


 

 

  Confidential

 

 

f. The Investor became aware of this offering of the Shares  solely by means
of direct contact between the Investor and ARYA, the Company or a
representative of ARYA or the Company, and the Shares were offered to the
Investor solely by direct contact between the Investor and ARYA, the Company
or a  representative of ARYA or the Company. The Investor did not become
aware of this offering of the Shares, nor were the Shares offered to the
Investor, by any other means. The Investor acknowledges that the Shares (i)
were not offered by any  form of general solicitation or general advertising
and (ii) are not being offered in a manner involving a public offering under,
or in a distribution in violation of, the Securities Act, or any state
securities laws. The Investor  acknowledges that it is not relying upon, and
has not relied upon, any statement, representation or warranty made by any
person, firm or corporation (including, without limitation, ARYA, the Company,
the Placement Agents (defined below), any  of their respective affiliates or
any control persons, officers, directors, employees, partners, agents or
representatives of any of the foregoing), other than the representations and
warranties of ARYA contained in Section 5 of this  Subscription Agreement, in
making its investment or decision to invest in ARYA.

 


 

 

g. The Investor acknowledges that it is aware that there are  substantial
risks incident to the purchase and ownership of the Shares, including those
set forth in ARYA's filings with the SEC. The Investor has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating 
the merits and risks of an investment in the Shares, and the Investor has
sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as the Investor has considered
necessary to make an informed investment decision.

 


 

 

h. Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), the  Investor has
analyzed and considered the risks of an investment in the Shares and
determined that the Shares are a suitable investment for the Investor and that
the Investor is able at this time and in the foreseeable future to bear the 
economic risk of a total loss of the Investor's investment in ARYA. The
Investor acknowledges specifically that a possibility of total loss exists.

 


 

 

i. In making its decision to purchase the Shares, the  Investor has relied
solely upon independent investigation made by the Investor. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Investor has not relied on any statements
or other information provided by or on behalf of the Placement  Agents or any
of their respective affiliates or any control persons, officers, directors,
employees, partners, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing
concerning ARYA, the Company, the Transaction, the Transaction Agreement,
this  Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, the Shares or the offer and sale of the Shares.

 


 

 

j. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that no federal or  state agency has
passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Shares or made any
findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

 


 

 

k. The Investor, if not an individual, has been duly formed  or incorporated
and is validly existing and is in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation or incorporation, with power and authority to enter
into, deliver and perform its obligations under this Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

l. The execution, delivery and performance by the Investor of  this
Subscription Agreement are within the powers of the Investor, have been duly
authorized and will not constitute or result in a breach or default under or
conflict with any order, ruling or regulation of any court or other tribunal
or of  any governmental commission or agency, or any agreement or other
undertaking, to which the Investor is a party or by which the Investor is
bound, and, if the Investor is not an individual, will not violate any
provisions of the Investor's  organizational documents, including, without
limitation, its incorporation or formation papers, bylaws, indenture of trust
or partnership or operating agreement, as may be applicable. The signature on
this Subscription Agreement is genuine,  and the signatory, if the Investor

a financial institution subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. Section
5311 et seq.) (the " _BSA_ "), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the
" _PATRIOT Act_ "),  and its implementing regulations (collectively, the "
_BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), the Investor maintains policies and procedures
reasonably designed to comply with applicable obligations under the
BSA/PATRIOT Act. To the extent required, it  maintains policies and
procedures reasonably designed for the screening of its investors against the
OFAC sanctions programs, including the OFAC List. To the extent required by
applicable law, the Investor maintains policies and procedures  reasonably
designed to ensure that the funds held by the Investor and used to purchase
the Shares were legally derived.

 


 

 

n. The Investor acknowledges that no disclosure or offering  document has
been prepared by Jefferies LLC, Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC or any of their
respective affiliates (collectively, the " _Placement Agents_ ") in connection
with the offer and sale of the Shares.

 


 

 

o. The Investor acknowledges that neither Placement Agent,  nor any of its
respective affiliates nor any control persons, officers, directors, employees,
partners, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing have made any
independent investigation with respect to ARYA, the Company or its 
subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, or the Shares or the
accuracy, completeness or adequacy of any information supplied to the Investor
by ARYA.

 


 

 

p. The Investor acknowledges that in connection with the  issue and purchase
of the Shares, neither Placement Agent has acted as the Investor's financial
advisor or fiduciary.

 


 

 

q. The Investor has or has commitments to have and, when  required to deliver
payment to ARYA pursuant to Section 2 above, will have, sufficient funds to
pay the Subscription Amount and consummate the purchase and sale of the Shares
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement.

7. _Registration Rights_.

 


 

 

(a) In the event that the Shares are not  registered in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction, ARYA agrees that, within thirty (30) calendar
days after the Closing Date (the " _Filing Date_ "), it will file with the SEC
(at its sole cost and expense) a registration  statement registering the
resale of the Shares (the " _Registration Statement_ "), and it shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof,  but no later than
the earlier of (i) sixty (60) calendar days (or ninety (90) calendar days if
the SEC notifies ARYA that it will "review" the Registration Statement)
following the Filing Date and (ii) ten (10) Business Days after ARYA is 
notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the
Registration Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to
further review (such earlier date, the " _Effectiveness Date_ "). ARYA agrees
to cause such  Registration Statement, or another shelf registration
statement that includes the Shares to be sold pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement, to remain effective until the earliest of (x) the fourth
anniversary of the Closing, (y) the date on  which the Investor ceases to
hold any Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, or (z) on the
first date on which the Investor is able to sell all of its Shares issued
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement (or shares received  in exchange
therefor) under Rule 144 of the Securities Act within 90 days without
limitation as to the amount of such securities that may be sold and without
the requirement for ARYA to be in compliance with the current public
information  required under Rule 144(c)(i) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable)
(the " _Effectiveness Period_ "). The Investor agrees to disclose its
ownership to ARYA upon request to assist it in making the determination
described above. In no event  shall the Investor be identified as a statutory
underwriter in the Registration Statement unless requested by the SEC;
provided, that if the SEC requests that the Investor be identified as a
statutory  underwriter in the Registration Statement, the Investor will have
an opportunity to withdraw its Shares from the Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SEC prevents ARYA from including any or
all of the shares proposed  to be registered under the Registration Statement
due to limitations on the use of Rule 415 of the Securities Act for the resale
of the Shares by the applicable shareholders or otherwise, such Registration
Statement shall register for resale  such number of Shares which is equal to
the maximum number of Shares as is permitted by the SEC. In such event, the
number of Shares to be registered for each selling shareholder named in the
Registration Statement shall be reduced pro rata  among all such selling
shareholders. For as long as the Registration Statement shall remain effective
pursuant to this Section 7(a), ARYA will use commercially reasonable efforts
to (1) qualify the Shares for listing on the Stock Exchange,  and (2) update
or amend the Registration Statement as necessary to include the Shares. For as
long as the Investor holds the Shares, ARYA will use commercially reasonable
efforts to file all reports, and provide all customary and reasonable 
cooperation, necessary to enable the undersigned to resell the Shares pursuant
to the Registration Statement or Rule 144 of the Securities Act (when Rule 144
of the Securities Act becomes available to the Investor), as applicable. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, ARYA may delay or
postpone filing of such Registration Statement, and from time to time require
the Investor not to sell under the Registration Statement or suspend the use
or  effectiveness of any such Registration Statement, if the board of
directors of ARYA determines in good faith that either in order for the
Registration Statement to not contain a material misstatement or omission, an
amendment thereto would be  needed, or if such filing or use could materially
affect a bona fide business or financing transaction of ARYA or would require
premature disclosure of information that could materially adversely affect
ARYA (each such circumstance, a " _Suspension   Event_ "); provided, that,
(I) ARYA shall not so delay filing or so suspend the use of the Registration
Statement for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days or more than
a total of one hundred-twenty (120) calendar days, in  each case in any three
hundred sixty (360) day period and (II) ARYA shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make such Registration Statement available for the sale by the
undersigned of such securities as soon as practicable thereafter.  If so
directed by ARYA, the Investor will deliver to ARYA or, in the Investor's sole
discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares in the
Investor's possession; provided, however, that this obligation to deliver or 
destroy all copies of the prospectus covering the Shares shall not apply (i)
to the extent the Investor is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (A)
in order to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or (B)
in  accordance with a bona fide pre-existing document retention policy or
(ii) to copies stored electronically on archival servers as a result of
automatic data back-up. ARYA's obligations to include the Shares issued
pursuant to this  Subscription Agreement (or shares issued in exchange
therefor) for resale in the Registration Statement are contingent upon the
Investor furnishing in writing to ARYA such information regarding the
Investor, the securities of ARYA held by the  Investor and the intended
method of disposition of such Shares, which shall be limited to non-
underwritten public offerings, as shall be reasonably requested by ARYA to
effect the registration of such Shares, and shall execute such documents  in
connection with such registration as ARYA may reasonably request that are
customary of a selling stockholder in similar situations.

 


 

 

  Confidential

 

 

(b) At its expense ARYA shall advise the  Investor within two (2) Business
Days: (i) when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto has become effective; (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to any Registration Statement or the  prospectus included therein
or for additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for such purpose; (iv) of the  receipt by ARYA
of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Shares included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and (v) subject to the 
provisions in this Subscription Agreement, of the occurrence of any event that
requires the making of any changes in any Registration Statement or prospectus
so that, as of such date, the statements therein are not misleading and do not
omit  to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. Upon receipt of any
written notice  from ARYA (which notice shall not contain any material non-
public information regarding ARYA) of the happening of any of the foregoing or
of a Suspension Event during the period that the Registration Statement is
effective or if as a result  of a Suspension Event the Registration Statement
or related prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of  the circumstances under which they
were made (in the case of the prospectus) not misleading, the undersigned
agrees that (1) it will immediately discontinue offers and sales of the Shares
under the Registration Statement (excluding, for the  avoidance of doubt,
sales conducted pursuant to Rule 144) until the undersigned receives copies of
a supplemental or amended prospectus (which ARYA agrees to promptly prepare)
that corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above  and
receives notice that any post-effective amendment has become effective or
unless otherwise notified by ARYA that it may resume such offers and sales,
and (2) it will maintain the confidentiality of any information included in
such written  notice delivered by ARYA except (A) for disclosure to the
Investor's employees, agents and professional advisers who need to know such
information and are obligated to keep it confidential, (B) for disclosures to
the extent required in order  to comply with reporting obligations to its
limited partners who have agreed to keep such information confidential and (C)
as required by law or subpoena. ARYA shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any  order suspending the effectiveness
of any Registration Statement as soon as reasonably practicable. Upon the
occurrence of any event contemplated in clauses (i) through (v) above, except
for such times as ARYA is permitted hereunder to  suspend, and has suspended,
the use of a prospectus forming part of a Registration Statement, ARYA shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to as soon as reasonably practicable
prepare a post-effective amendment to such Registration  Statement or a
supplement to the related prospectus, or file any other required document so
that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Shares included therein,
such prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a material fact  or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 


 

 

(c) Indemnification.

 


 

 

(i) ARYA agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent  permitted by
law, the Investor, its directors, and officers, employees, and agents, and
each person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act) and each affiliate of the Investor (within the 
meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, any attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with
defending or  investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, prospectus included in any Registration Statement (" _Prospectus_
") or preliminary  Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except
insofar as the same are caused  by or contained in any information furnished
in writing to ARYA by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use therein.

 


 

 

(ii) The Investor agrees, severally and not jointly with any  other person
that is a party to the Other Subscription Agreements, to indemnify and hold
harmless ARYA, its directors and officers and agents and each person who
controls ARYA (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, 
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material
fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary
Prospectus or any  amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in  any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by the Investor expressly for use therein. In no event
shall the liability of the Investor be greater in amount than the dollar
amount of the net proceeds received by such Investor upon the  sale of the
Shares purchased pursuant to this Subscription Agreement giving rise to such
indemnification obligation.

 


 

 

(iii) Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (1)  give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall
not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the extent 
such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (2) permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the
indemnifying  party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its consent. An indemnifying party who
elects not to assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the
fees and expenses of  more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by
such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of legal counsel to any indemnified party a conflict of interest
exists between such indemnified party  and any other of such indemnified
parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the
consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all  respects by the
payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant
to the terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to  such
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.

 


 

 

(iv) The indemnification provided for under this Subscription  Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director, employee,
agent, affiliate or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall 
survive the transfer of the Shares purchased pursuant to this Subscription
Agreement.

 


 

 

  Confidential

 

 

(v) If the indemnification provided under this Section 7(c)  from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the  indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the  indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any  action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified  party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses or other  liabilities referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. No person  guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this Section
7(c) from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 


 

 

8. _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall  terminate and be void and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such  date and time as the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (b) upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto and the Company to terminate this Subscription Agreement, (c) ARYA's notification to  the Investor in writing that it has, with the written consent of the Company, abandoned its plans to move forward with the Transaction and/or terminated the Investor's obligations with respect to the subscription without the delivery of the  Shares having occurred, (d) the Termination Date (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), if the Closing has not occurred by such date, or (e) if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 3 of this Subscription Agreement are not  satisfied or waived, or are not capable of being satisfied, on or prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement will not be and are not consummated at the Closing (the termination  events described in clauses (a)-(e) above, collectively, the " _Termination Events_ "); _provided_ that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of termination, and each  party will be entitled to any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from any such willful breach. ARYA shall notify the Investor of the termination of the Transaction Agreement promptly after the  termination of such agreement. Upon the occurrence of any Termination Event, this Subscription Agreement shall be void and of no further effect and any monies paid by the Investor to ARYA in connection herewith shall promptly (and in any  event within one business day) following the Termination Event be returned to the Investor.

 


 

 

9. _Trust Account Waiver_. The Investor acknowledges  that ARYA is a blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination involving ARYA and one or more businesses or assets. The Investor further acknowledges  that, as described in ARYA's prospectus relating to its initial public offering dated June 4, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at www.sec.gov, substantially all of ARYA's assets consist of the cash proceeds of ARYA's initial public  offering and private placement of its securities, and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the benefit of ARYA, its public shareholders and the underwriters of ARYA's  initial public offering. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to ARYA to pay its tax obligations, if any, the cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only for the purposes set  forth in the Prospectus. For and in consideration of ARYA entering into this Subscription Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Investor hereby irrevocably waives any and all right, title and interest,  or any claim of any kind it has or may have in the future, in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement; provided,  however, that nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to limit the Investor's right, title, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account by virtue of its record or beneficial ownership of Class A Shares currently outstanding on  the date hereof, pursuant to a validly exercised redemption right with respect to any such Class A Shares, except to the extent that the Investor has otherwise agreed with ARYA to not exercise such redemption right.

 


 

 

10. _Miscellaneous_.

 


 

 

a. Neither this Subscription Agreement nor any rights that  may accrue to the
Investor hereunder (other than the Shares acquired hereunder, if any) may be
transferred or assigned.

b. ARYA may request from the Investor such additional  information as ARYA
may deem necessary to register the resale of the Shares and evaluate the
eligibility of the Investor to acquire the Shares, and the Investor shall
provide such information as may reasonably be requested. The Investor 
acknowledges that ARYA may file a copy of this Subscription Agreement with the
SEC as an exhibit to a periodic report or a registration statement of ARYA.

 


 

 

c. The Investor acknowledges that ARYA, the Company, the  Placement Agents
and others will rely on the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements,
representations and warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement. Prior
to the Closing, the Investor agrees to promptly notify ARYA, the Company  and
the Placement Agents if any of the acknowledgments, understandings,
agreements, representations and warranties set forth in Section 6 above are no
longer accurate. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that each purchase by
the Investor of  Shares from ARYA will constitute a reaffirmation of the
acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations and warranties
herein (as modified by any such notice) by the Investor as of the time of such
purchase.

 


 

 

d. ARYA, the Company and the Placement Agents are each  entitled to rely upon
this Subscription Agreement and each is irrevocably authorized to produce this
Subscription Agreement or a copy hereof to any interested party in any
administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to  the
matters covered hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing clause of
this Section 10(d) shall not give the Company or the Placement Agents any
rights other than those expressly set forth herein and, without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the Company be entitled to rely on any of the representations and warranties
of ARYA set forth in this Subscription Agreement.

 


 

 

e. All of the agreements, representations and warranties made  by each party
hereto in this Subscription Agreement shall survive the Closing.

 


 

 

f. This Subscription Agreement may not be modified, waived or  terminated
(other than pursuant to the terms of Section 8 above) except by an instrument
in writing, signed by each of the parties hereto, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no modification or waiver by ARYA of the provisions of this 
Subscription Agreement shall be effective without the prior written consent of
the Company (other than modifications or waivers that are solely ministerial
in nature or otherwise immaterial and do not affect any economic or any other
material  term of this Subscription Agreement). No failure or delay of either
party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment  or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or
power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies
of the parties hereunder are cumulative  and are not exclusive of any rights
or remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder.

 


 

 

g. This Subscription Agreement (including the schedule  hereto) constitutes
the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as set forth
in  Section 8, Section 10(c), Section 10(d), Section 10(f), this Section
10(g) and the last sentence of Section 10(k) with respect to the persons
specifically referenced therein, this Subscription Agreement shall not confer
any rights or remedies  upon any person other than the parties hereto, and
their respective successor and assigns, and the parties hereto acknowledge
that such persons so referenced are third party beneficiaries of this
Subscription Agreement for the purposes of,  and to the extent of, the rights
granted to them, if any, pursuant to such provisions.

 


 

 

h. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subscription  Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs,
executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives, and permitted
assigns, and the agreements, representations, warranties, covenants  and
acknowledgments contained herein shall be deemed to be made by, and be binding
upon, such heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives
and permitted assigns.

 


 

 

i. If any provision of this Subscription Agreement shall be  adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Subscription Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby 
and shall continue in full force and effect.

 


 

 

j. This Subscription Agreement may be executed in one or more  counterparts
(including by facsimile or electronic mail or in .pdf) and by different
parties in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all parties
hereto had signed the same document. All counterparts so executed and
delivered  shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

k. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable  damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an 
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Subscription Agreement,
without posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages, to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Subscription Agreement, this
being in  addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to seek to
specifically enforce the Investor's  obligations to fund the Subscription
Amount and the provisions of the Subscription Agreement of which the Company
is an express third party beneficiary, in each case, on the terms and subject

The  Investor acknowledges that it is not relying upon, and has not relied upon, any statement, representation or warranty made by any person, firm or corporation (including, without limitation, the Placement Agents, any of their respective  affiliates or any control persons, officers, directors, employees, partners, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing), other than the statements, representations and warranties of ARYA expressly contained in Section 5 of this  Subscription Agreement, in making its investment or decision to invest in ARYA. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that none of (i) any other investor pursuant to this Subscription Agreement or any other subscription agreement related to  the private placement of the Shares (including the investor's respective affiliates or any control persons, officers, directors, employees, partners, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing) or (ii) the Placement Agents, their  respective affiliates or any control persons, officers, directors, employees, partners, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing, shall have any liability to the Investor, or to any other investor, pursuant to, arising out of or  relating to this Subscription Agreement or any other subscription agreement related to the private placement of the Shares, the negotiation hereof or thereof or its subject matter, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,  including, without limitation, with respect to any action heretofore or hereafter taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in connection with the purchase of the Shares or with respect to any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)  for breach of this Subscription Agreement or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, as expressly provided herein, or for any actual or alleged inaccuracies, misstatements or  omissions with respect to any information or materials of any kind furnished by ARYA, the Company, the Placement Agents or any Non-Party Affiliate concerning ARYA, the Company, the Placement Agents, any of their controlled affiliates, this  Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, "Non-Party Affiliates" means each former, current or future officer, director, employee, partner, member, manager, direct or indirect  equityholder or affiliate of ARYA, the Company, any Placement Agent or any of ARYA's, the Company's or any Placement Agent's controlled affiliates or any family member of the foregoing.

 


 

 

12. _Disclosure_.

3.1.1.1. At any time after the Closing Date, any Sponsor Holder shall have
the  right to make one or more written requests from time to time (a "Demand
Registration Request") to the Company for Registration of all or part of the
Registrable Securities held by such Sponsor Holder.   Any such Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration Request shall hereinafter be referred to as
a "Demand Registration."

 


 

 

3.1.1.2. Each Demand Registration Request shall specify (x) the kind and 
aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered, and (y) the
intended method or methods of disposition thereof including pursuant to an
Underwritten Public Offering.

 


 

 

3.1.1.3. Upon receipt of a Demand Registration Request, the Company shall as 
promptly as practicable file a Registration Statement (a "Demand Registration
Statement") relating to such Demand Registration, and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such Demand Registration  Statement to be promptly declared
effective under the Securities Act.

 


 

 

3.1.2. _Limitation on Demand Registrations_. The Company shall not be 
obligated to take any action to effect any Demand Registration if a Demand
Registration or Piggyback Registration was declared effective or an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown was consummated within the preceding ninety (90)
days (unless otherwise  consented to by the Company).

 


 

 

3.1.3. _Demand Notice_. Promptly upon receipt of a Demand Registration 
Request pursuant to _Section 3.1.1_ (but in no event more than two (2)
Business Days thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice (a
"Demand Notice") of any such Demand Registration  Request to all other
Sponsor Holders and the Demand Notice shall offer each such Sponsor Holder the
opportunity to include in the Demand Registration that number of Registrable
Securities as each such Sponsor Holder may request in writing.   Subject to
_Section 3.1.7_ , the Company shall include in the Demand Registration all
such Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received
written requests for inclusion therein within three (3) Business Days after 
the date that the Demand Notice was delivered.

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 9 -  


 

 

3.1.4. _Demand Withdrawal_. Any Sponsor Holder that has requested its 
Registrable Securities be included in a Demand Registration pursuant to
_Section 3.1.1_ or _Section 3.1.3_ may withdraw all or any portion of its
Registrable Securities included in a Demand Registration from such Demand 
Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Demand
Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a notice to such effect with respect
to all of the Registrable Securities included in such Demand Registration, the
Company  shall cease all efforts to secure effectiveness of the applicable
Demand Registration Statement.

 


 

 

3.1.5. _Effective Registration_. The Company shall use reasonable best 
efforts to cause the applicable Demand Registration Statement to become
effective promptly after receipt of a Demand Registration Request and remain
effective for not less than one hundred eighty (180) days (or such shorter
period as will  terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by such
Demand Registration Statement have been sold or withdrawn), or, if such Demand
Registration Statement relates to an Underwritten Public Offering, such longer
period as in the opinion  of counsel for the underwriter or underwriters a
Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of
Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer.

 


 

 

3.1.6. _Delay in Filing; Suspension of Registration_. If the filing,  initial
effectiveness or continued use of a Demand Registration Statement at any time
would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon
giving prompt written notice of such action to the Sponsor Holders, delay
the  filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Demand
Registration Statement (a "Demand Suspension"); _provided_ , _however,_ that
the Company shall not be permitted to exercise a  Demand Suspension more than
one (1) time during any twelve (12)-month period or for a total period of
greater than sixty (60) days; and _provided further_ that the Company shall
not register any securities for its own account or that of  any other
stockholder during such sixty (60)-day period, other than pursuant to a
registration relating to the sale or grant of securities to employees or
directors of the Company or a subsidiary pursuant to a stock option, stock
purchase,  equity incentive or similar plan; a registration on any form that
does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be
included in a registration statement covering the sale of the Registrable
Securities; or a  registration in which the only Common Stock being
registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that
are also being registered. In the case of a Demand Suspension, the Sponsor
Holders agree to suspend use of the  applicable Prospectus in connection with
any sale or purchase, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities,
upon receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately
notify the Sponsor Holders in writing upon the  termination of any Demand
Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements
therein not misleading and furnish to the Sponsor Holders such numbers of
copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Sponsor Holders
may reasonably request. The Company shall, if necessary, supplement or amend 
the Demand Registration Statement, if required by the registration form used
by the Company for the Demand Registration or by the instructions applicable
to such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or
regulations  promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be requested by the
Sponsor Holders holding a majority of Registrable Securities that are included
in such Demand Registration Statement.

Underwritten Public Offering of the Registrable Securities included in a
Demand Registration advise the Company in writing that, in its or their
opinion, the number of securities  requested to be included in such Demand
Registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without
being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of
the securities offered or the market for the  securities offered, then the
securities to be included in such Registration shall be, in the case of any
Demand Registration, (x) first, allocated to each Sponsor Holder that has
requested to participate in such Demand Registration an amount  equal to the
lesser of (i) the number of such Registrable Securities requested to be
registered or sold by such Sponsor Holder, and (ii) a number of such shares
equal to such Sponsor Holder's Pro Rata Portion, and (y) second, and only if
all  the securities referred to in clause (x) have been included, the number
of other securities that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or
underwriters can be sold without having such adverse effect.

 


 

 

3.2. _Shelf Registration_.

 


 

 

3.2.1. _Request for Shelf Registration_.

 


 

 

3.2.1.1. At any time after the Closing Date, upon the written request of any 
Sponsor Holder from time to time (a "Shelf Registration Request"), the Company
shall promptly file with the SEC a shelf Registration Statement pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act ("Shelf Registration Statement") relating to
the offer and sale of Registrable Securities by any Sponsor Holders thereof
from time to time providing for any method or combination of methods of
distribution  legally available to any Sponsor Holder, and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to
promptly become effective under the Securities Act. Any such Registration
pursuant to a Shelf  Registration Request shall hereinafter be referred to as
a "Shelf Registration." The Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders shall be
deemed to have given a Shelf Registration Request as of the date of  this
Agreement with respect to all of their Registrable Securities, and the Company
may satisfy this Shelf Registration Request by including such Registrable
Securities on the PIPE Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that
the inclusion of such Registrable Securities on the PIPE Registration
Statement shall not relieve the Company of any of its other obligations with
respect to such Registrable Securities pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ or
otherwise;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required
to deliver a Shelf Registration Notice to any other Holder as a result of such
Shelf Registration Request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein,  the Individual Holders shall be entitled to include the Registrable
Securities held by them at Closing in the Shelf Registration Statement filed
by the Company in connection with the PIPE Financing (and shall be deemed to
have given notice of  such a request as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to all of their Registrable Securities), or, if such Shelf
Registration Statement is not then effective, in any other Shelf Registration
Statement filed by the Company following a  Shelf Registration Request made
by the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders, including the Shelf Registration
Request deemed to have been given pursuant to the preceding sentence, in each
case, in order to facilitate Non-Underwritten  Offerings.

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 11 -  


 

 

3.2.1.2. If on the date of the Shelf Registration Request the Company is a 
WKSI, then the Shelf Registration Request may request Registration of an
unspecified amount of Registrable Securities to be sold by unspecified
Holders. If on the date of the Shelf Registration Request the Company is not a
WKSI, then the  Shelf Registration Request shall specify the aggregate amount
of Registrable Securities to be registered. The Company shall provide to any
Sponsor Holder the information necessary to determine the Company's status as
a WKSI upon such Sponsor  Holder's request.

 


 

 

3.2.2. _Shelf Registration Notice_. Promptly upon receipt of a Shelf 
Registration Request (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days
thereafter (or such shorter period as may be reasonably requested in
connection with an underwritten "block trade")), the Company shall deliver a
written notice (a "Shelf Registration Notice") of any such request to all
other Sponsor Holders, which notice shall specify, if applicable, the amount
of Registrable Securities to be registered, and the Shelf Registration 
Notice shall offer each such Sponsor Holder the opportunity to include in the
Shelf Registration that number of Registrable Securities as each such Sponsor
Holder may request in writing. The Company shall include in such Shelf
Registration  all such Registrable Securities with respect to which the
Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within three (3)
Business Days (or such shorter period as may be reasonably requested in
connection with an underwritten  "block trade") after the date that the Shelf
Registration Notice has been delivered.

 


 

 

3.2.3. _Continued Effectiveness_. The Company shall use its reasonable  best
efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under
the Securities Act in order to permit the Prospectus forming part of the Shelf
Registration Statement to be usable by Sponsor Holders until the earlier of: 
(i) the date as of which all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to
the Shelf Registration Statement or another Registration Statement filed under
the Securities Act (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to
in  Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder); and (ii)
the date as of which no Sponsor Holder holds Registrable Securities (such
period of continuous effectiveness, the "Shelf Period").        Subject
to _Section 3.2.4_ , the Company shall be deemed not to have used its
reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective
during the Shelf Period if the Company voluntarily takes any action or omits
to take  any action that would result in Sponsor Holders of the Registrable
Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell any Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement during the Shelf
Period, unless such  action or omission is required by applicable law.

 


 

 

3.2.4. _Suspension of Registration_. If the continued use of such Shelf 
Registration Statement at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such
action to the Sponsor Holders, suspend use of the Shelf Registration Statement
(a "Shelf Suspension"); _provided_ , _however,_ that the Company shall not be
permitted to exercise a Shelf Suspension more than one (1) time during any
twelve (12)-month period or for a total period  of greater than sixty (60)
days. In the case of a Shelf Suspension, the Sponsor Holders agree to suspend
use of the applicable Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of,
or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon  receipt of the
notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify the Sponsor
Holders in writing upon the termination of any Shelf Suspension, amend or
supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue 
statement of a material fact or any omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and
furnish to the Sponsor Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so
amended  or supplemented as the Sponsor Holders may reasonably request. The
Company shall, if necessary, supplement or amend the Shelf Registration
Statement, if required by the registration form used by the Company for the
Shelf Registration  Statement or by the instructions applicable to such
registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be requested by the Sponsor
Holders holding a majority of Registrable  Securities that are included in
such Shelf Registration Statement.

thereof, such Sponsor Holder may make a written request (a "Shelf  Takedown
Request" and such Sponsor Holder, the "Requesting Holder") to the Company to
effect a Public Offering, including pursuant to an Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, of all or a portion of such  Sponsor Holder's Registrable
Securities that may be registered under such Shelf Registration Statement, and
as soon as practicable the Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf
Registration Statement as necessary for such purpose.

 


 

 

3.2.5.2. Promptly upon receipt of a Shelf Takedown Request (but in no event 
more than two (2) Business Days thereafter (or more than twenty-four (24)
hours thereafter in connection with an underwritten "block trade")) for any
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, the Company shall deliver a notice (a "Shelf
Takedown Notice") to each other Sponsor Holder with Registrable Securities
covered by the applicable Registration Statement, or to all other Sponsor
Holders if such Registration Statement is  undesignated (each, a "Potential
Takedown Participant"). The Shelf Takedown Notice shall offer each such
Potential Takedown Participant the opportunity to include in any Underwritten
Shelf Takedown  such number of Registrable Securities as each such Potential
Takedown Participant may request in writing. The Company shall include in the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown all such Registrable Securities with respect to
which the Company has  received written requests for inclusion therein within
three (3) Business Days (or within twenty-four (24) hours in connection with
an underwritten "block trade") after the date that the Shelf Takedown Notice
has been delivered. Any  Potential Takedown Participant's request to
participate in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be binding on the
Potential Takedown Participant; _provided_ that each such Potential Takedown
Participant that elects to participate may  condition its participation on
the Underwritten Shelf Takedown being completed within ten (10) Business Days
of its acceptance at a price per share (after giving effect to any
underwriters' discounts or commissions) to such Potential Takedown 
Participant of not less than a percentage of the closing price for the shares
on their principal trading market on the Business Day immediately prior to
such Potential Takedown Participant's election to participate, as specified in
such  Potential Takedown Participant's request to participate in such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown (the "Participation Conditions"). Notwithstanding
the delivery of any Shelf Takedown Notice, but subject to  the Participation
Conditions (to the extent applicable), all determinations as to whether to
complete any Underwritten Shelf Takedown and as to the timing, manner, price
and other terms of any Underwritten Shelf Takedown contemplated by this 
_Section 3.2.5_ shall be determined by the Requesting Holder.

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 13 -  


 

 

3.2.5.3. The Company shall not be obligated to take any action to effect any 
Underwritten Shelf Takedown if a Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration
was declared effective or an Underwritten Shelf Takedown was consummated
within the preceding ninety (90) days (unless otherwise consented to by the
Company).

 


 

 

3.2.6. _Priority of Securities Sold Pursuant to Shelf Takedowns_. If the 
managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, or the Requesting Holder of a proposed "block trade" conducted as an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in each case pursuant to _Section 3.2.5_ advise
the  Company in writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of
securities requested to be included in the proposed Underwritten Shelf
Takedown exceeds the number that can be sold in such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown without being likely to  have an adverse effect on the price, timing
or distribution of the securities offered or the market for the securities
offered, the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such offering
shall be (x) first, allocated to each Sponsor  Holder that has requested to
participate in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the number of such Registrable Securities requested to be registered or
sold by such Sponsor Holder, and (ii) a number of such  shares equal to such
Holder's Pro Rata Portion, and (y) second, and only if all the securities
referred to in clause (x) have been included, the number of other securities
that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters (or 
Requesting Holder, as the case may be) can be sold without having such adverse
effect.

 


 

 

3.3. _Piggyback Registration_.

 


 

 

3.3.1. _Participation_. At any time after the Closing Date, if the  Company
at any time proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act
or to conduct a Public Offering with respect to any offering of its equity
securities for its own account or for the account of any other Persons
(other  than (i) a Registration under _Sections 3.1_ or _3.2_ , (ii) a
Registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor form to such forms or
(iii) a Registration of securities solely relating to an offering and sale to
employees or  directors of the Company or its subsidiaries pursuant to any
employee stock plan or other employee benefit plan arrangement), then, as soon
as practicable (but in no event less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
proposed date of filing  of such Registration Statement or, in the case of a
Public Offering under a Shelf Registration Statement, the anticipated pricing
or trade date), the Company shall give written notice (a "Piggyback
Notice")       of such proposed filing or Public Offering to all Sponsor
Holders, and such Piggyback Notice shall offer the Sponsor Holders the
opportunity to register under such Registration Statement, or to sell in such
Public Offering, such number of  Registrable Securities as each such Sponsor
Holder may request in writing (a "Piggyback Registration"). Subject to
_Section 3.3.2_ , the Company shall include in such Registration Statement or
in  such Public Offering as applicable, all such Registrable Securities that
are requested to be included therein within three (3) Business Days after the
receipt by such Holder of any such notice; _provided_ , _however,_ that if
at  any time after giving written notice of its intention to register or sell
any securities and prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement
filed in connection with such Registration, or the pricing or trade date of a
Public  Offering under a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company determines
for any reason not to register or sell or to delay the Registration or sale of
such securities, the Company shall give written notice of such determination
to each Holder  and, thereupon, (x) in the case of a determination not to
register or sell, shall be relieved of its obligation to register or sell any
Registrable Securities in connection with such Registration or Public Offering
(but not from its  obligation to pay the Registration Expenses in connection
therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any Holders entitled
to request that such Registration or sale be effected as a Demand Registration
under _Section 3.1_   or an Underwritten Shelf Takedown under _Section 3.2_ ,
as the case may be, and (y) in the case of a determination to delay
Registration or sale, in the absence of a request for a Demand Registration or
an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, as  the case may be, shall be permitted to
delay registering or selling any Registrable Securities, for the same period
as the delay in registering or selling such other securities. Any Holder shall
have the right to withdraw all or part of its  request for inclusion of its

3.3.2. _Priority of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing underwriter  or
underwriters of any proposed offering of Registrable Securities included in a
Piggyback Registration informs the Company and the participating Holders in
writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of securities that such
Holders and  any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the
number that can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a
significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
securities offered or the market  for the securities offered, then the
securities to be included in such Registration shall be (i) first, one hundred
percent (100%) of the securities that the Company proposes to sell; (ii)
second, and only if all the securities referred to in  clause (i) have been
included, the number of Registrable Securities that, in the opinion of such
managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse
effect, with such number to be allocated among the Holders that  have
requested to participate in such Registration based on an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) the number of such Registrable Securities requested to be sold
by such Holder, and (y) a number of such shares equal to such Holder's Pro
Rata  Portion; (iii) third, and only if all of the Registrable Securities
referred to in clause (ii) have been included in such Registration, any other
securities eligible for inclusion in such Registration.

 


 

 

3.3.3. _No Effect on Other Registrations_. No Registration of  Registrable
Securities effected pursuant to a request under this _Section 3.3_ shall be
deemed to have been effected pursuant to _Sections 3.1_ and _3.2_ or shall
relieve the Company of its obligations under _Sections 3.1_   and _3.2_.

 


 

 

3.4. _Lock-Up Agreements_.

 


 

 

3.4.1. Each Investor agrees that such Investor shall not Transfer any Shares 
or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable (directly or
indirectly) for the Shares (including new Shares issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement) for one
hundred  eighty (180)-days following the Closing Date (the "Lock-up Period").
The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude each Investor during
such one hundred eighty (180)-day period from engaging  in any hedging or
other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected
to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of such Investor's Shares even
if such Shares would be disposed of by someone other than the  undersigned.
Such prohibited hedging or other transactions during such one hundred eighty
(180)-day period would include without limitation any short sale or any
purchase, sale or grant of any right (including, without limitation, any put
or  call option) with respect to any of the Investor's Shares or with respect
to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of
its value from such Shares. The foregoing notwithstanding, (x) each executive
officer and  director of the Company shall be permitted to establish a plan
to acquire and sell Shares pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act,
provided that such plan does not provide for the Transfer of Shares during the
Lock-up Period and (y) to  the extent any Sponsor Investor is granted a
release or waiver from the restrictions contained in this _Section 3.4.1_
prior to the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, then all Sponsor Investors
shall be automatically granted a release or  waiver from the restrictions
contained in this _Section 3.4.1_ to the same extent, on substantially the
same terms as and on a pro rata basis with, the Sponsor Investor to which such
release or waiver is granted. The foregoing  restrictions shall not apply to
Transfers made: (i) pursuant to a bona fide gift or charitable contribution;
(ii) by will or intestate succession upon the death of an Investor; (iii) to
any Permitted Transferee; (iv) pursuant to a court order  or settlement
agreement related to the distribution of assets in connection with the
dissolution of marriage or civil union; (v) pro rata to the partners, members
or shareholders of a Sponsor Investor upon its liquidation or dissolution;
or  (vi) in the event of the Company's completion of a liquidation, merger,
share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of its
shareholders having the right to exchange their Common Stock for cash,
securities or other  property; _provided_ that in the case of (i), (iii) or
(v), the recipient of such Transfer must enter into a written agreement
agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including the transfer
restrictions set forth in this _Section       3.4.1_. This _Section
3.4.1_ shall constitute an amendment and restatement of sections 5(a) and (c)
of that certain letter agreement, dated as of June 4, 2020, by and among the
ARYA Sponsor, the Company and each Individual  Investor, in their entirety.

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 15 -  


 

 

3.4.2. Each Sponsor Investor also agrees, and the Company agrees and shall 
cause each director and officer of the Company to agree, that, in connection
with each Registration or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section
3.1_ , _3.2_ or _3.3_ conducted as an Underwritten Public Offering, if 
requested, to become bound by and to execute and deliver a customary lock-up
agreement with the underwriter(s) of such Underwritten Public Offering
restricting such applicable person or entity's right to (a) Transfer, directly
or indirectly,  any equity securities of the Company held by such person or
entity or (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to
another any of the economic consequences of ownership of such securities
during the period commencing on the  date of the final Prospectus relating to
the Underwritten Public Offering and ending on the date specified by the
underwriters (such period not to exceed ninety (90) days). The terms of such
lock-up agreements shall be negotiated among the  applicable Sponsor
Investors requested to enter into lock-up agreements in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company and the underwriters and shall
include customary exclusions from the restrictions on Transfer set forth 
therein, including that such restrictions on the applicable Sponsor Investors
shall be conditioned upon all officers and directors of the Company, as well
as all Sponsor Investors, being subject to the same restrictions; _provided_
,  that, to the extent any Sponsor Investor is granted a release or waiver
from the restrictions contained in this _Section 3.4.2_ and in such Sponsor
Investor's lock-up agreement prior to the expiration of the period set forth
in such  Sponsor Investor's lock-up agreement, then all Sponsor Investors
shall be automatically granted a release or waiver from the restrictions
contained in this _Section 3.4.1_ and the applicable lock-up agreements to
which they are party to  the same extent, on substantially the same terms as
and on a pro rata basis with, the Sponsor Investor to which such release or
waiver is granted. The provisions of this _Section 3.4.2_ shall not apply to
any Sponsor Investor that  holds less than one percent (1%) of then total
issued and outstanding Common Stock.

relating to, or which may affect, the Registration; (iii) of the issuance by
the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement or any order by the SEC or any other regulatory  authority
preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary or final Prospectus or the
initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such purposes; (iv) if, at
any time, the representations and warranties of the Company in any
applicable  underwriting agreement cease to be true and correct in all
material respects; and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification

3.5.1.4. promptly notify each selling Holder and the managing underwriter or 
underwriters, if any, when the Company becomes aware of the happening of any
event as a result of which the applicable Registration Statement or the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (as then in effect)
contains any untrue  statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such
Prospectus or any preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading,  when any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus includes information that may conflict with the information
contained in the Registration Statement, or, if for any other reason, it shall
be necessary during such time period to amend or supplement  such
Registration Statement or Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities
Act and, as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, prepare and file
with the SEC, and furnish without charge to the selling Holders and the

Statement such disclosures as may be required by Rule 430B under the
Securities Act (referring  to the unnamed selling security holders in a
generic manner by identifying the initial offering of the securities to the
Holders) in order to ensure that the Holders may be added to such Shelf
Registration Statement at a later time through  the filing of a Prospectus
supplement rather than a post-effective amendment;

 


 

 

3.5.1.6. use its reasonable best efforts to prevent, or obtain the
withdrawal  of, any stop order or other order or notice preventing or
suspending the use of any preliminary or final Prospectus;

such Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling
Holders and the  underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and
sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto);

of Registrable Securities as to which any Registration or sale is being

cooperate with the Company in the negotiation of the underwriting agreement
and shall give consideration to the reasonable suggestions of the Company
regarding the form thereof, and such  Sponsor Holders shall complete and
execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney and other documents reasonably

are generally prevailing in agreements of that type, and the aggregate amount
of the liability of such Sponsor  Holder under such agreement shall not
exceed such Sponsor Holder's proceeds from the sale of its Registrable
Securities in the offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions but
before expenses.

 


 

 

3.6.2. _Piggyback Registrations_. If the Company proposes to register or 
sell any of its securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by
_Section 3.3_ and such securities are to be distributed through one or more
underwriters, the Company shall, if requested by any Sponsor Holder pursuant
to _Section       3.3_ and, subject to the provisions of _Section 3.3.2_
, use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include
on the same terms and conditions that apply to the other sellers in such
Registration or sale all  the Registrable Securities to be offered and sold
by such Holder among the securities of the Company to be distributed by such
underwriters in such Registration or sale. The Holders of Registrable
Securities to be distributed by such  underwriters shall be parties to a
customary underwriting agreement between the Company and such underwriters and
shall complete and execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney and other
documents reasonably requested by the underwriters  and required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements. Any such Holder shall not be required
to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or
the underwriters other than representations, warranties or  agreements
regarding such Holder, such Holder's title to the Registrable Securities, such
Holder's intended method of distribution and any other representations to be

reasonably acceptable to the Company. In the case of an Underwritten Public
Offering under _Section 3.3_ , the managing underwriter or underwriters to 
administer the offering shall be determined by the Company; _provided_ that
such underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Sponsor
Holders holding a majority of Registrable Securities being sold in such 
offering. In the case of an Underwritten Public Offering under _Sections 3.1_
, _3.2_ or _3.3_ , each participating Sponsor Holder shall be entitled to

counsel necessary to deliver any required legal opinions.

contrary and subject to applicable law, regulation and NASDAQ rules, any Non-
Underwritten Offering shall be conducted in accordance with the Company's
insider trading policy to the extent that such selling stockholder is then
subject to  such policy.

 


 

 

3.7. _No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights_. Neither the  Company
nor any of its subsidiaries shall hereafter enter into, and neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries is currently a party to, any agreement
with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to
the  Holders by this Agreement. Without the approval of the Sponsor Holders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding (voting
together as a single class on an as-converted basis), neither the Company nor
any of its  subsidiaries shall enter into any agreement granting registration
or similar rights to any Person, and the Company hereby represents and
warrants that, as of the date hereof, no registration or similar rights have
been granted to any other  Person other than pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has entered into Subscription
Agreements providing for the PIPE Financing and entry into such agreements
shall not constitute a breach of the  representations and warranties and
covenants set forth in this _Section 3.7_.

or "Blue Sky" laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for
the underwriters in connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable

3.9. _Indemnification_.

 


 

 

3.9.1. _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company shall indemnify and 
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder, each
shareholder, member, limited or general partner of such Holder, each
shareholder, member, limited or general partner of each such shareholder,
member, limited or general  partner, each of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, advisors, and agents and each
Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act) such Persons and each of their  respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several (including reasonable
costs of investigation and legal expenses and any indemnity  and contribution
payments made to underwriters ) (each, a "Loss" and collectively "Losses")
arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue  statement of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which such
Registrable Securities are registered or sold under the Securities Act
(including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein or
any  amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by
reference therein) or any other disclosure document produced by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries including any report and other
document filed  under the Exchange Act, (ii) any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus or preliminary
Prospectus, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries of any federal, state, foreign or common law rule or
regulation applicable to the Company or any of  its subsidiaries and relating
to action or inaction in connection with any such Registration, disclosure
document or other document or report; _provided,_ that no selling Holder shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section       3.9.1_ in
respect of any untrue statement or omission contained in any information
relating to such selling Holder furnished in writing by such selling Holder to
the Company specifically for inclusion in a Registration Statement and used 
by the Company in conformity therewith (such information "Selling Stockholder
Information"). This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the
Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall  remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or
any indemnified party and shall survive the Transfer of such securities by
such Holder and regardless of any indemnity agreed to in the  underwriting
agreement that is less favorable to the Holders. The Company shall also
indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar
securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their
officers and  directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the
meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as
provided above (with appropriate modification) with respect to the
indemnification of the indemnified  parties.

 

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 24 -   
 

 

3.9.2. _Indemnification by the Selling Holders_. Each selling Holder  agrees
(severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and officers and each
Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act or
the  Exchange Act) from and against any Losses resulting from (i) any untrue
statement of a material fact in any Registration Statement under which such
Registrable Securities were registered or sold under the Securities Act
(including any final,  preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by
reference therein) or (ii) any omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or  necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of a Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, in each case to the
extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue  statement or omission is
contained in such selling Holder's Selling Stockholder Information. In no
event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount
than the dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of its  Registrable
Securities in the offering giving rise to such indemnification obligation, net
of underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses, less any
amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to _Section 3.9.4_ and any amounts  paid
by such Holder as a result of liabilities incurred under the underwriting
agreement, if any, related to such sale.

 


 

 

3.9.3. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person entitled to 
indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
( _provided_ that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party
shall relieve  the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder only to
the extent, if at all, that it forfeits substantive legal rights by reason of
such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the
defense of such claim with  counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party; _provided_ , _however,_ that any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of  such claim, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (a) the
indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (b) the
indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the  defense of such claim
within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim from the Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Person, (c) the indemnified party has reasonably 
concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be legal defenses
available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in
addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (d) in the
reasonable judgment  of any such Person (based upon advice of its counsel) a
conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party
with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the
indemnifying party in writing that  such Person elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such
Person). If the indemnifying party assumes the  defense, the indemnifying
party shall not have the right to settle such action without the consent of
the indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as  an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to
such claim or litigation without the prior written consent of such
indemnified  party. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party,
the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made without its prior written consent, but such consent may not be
unreasonably withheld. It is  understood that the indemnifying party or
parties shall not, except as specifically set forth in this _Section 3.9.3_ ,
in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees,  disbursements or other
charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such
jurisdiction at any one time unless (x) the employment of more than one
counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties, 
(y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on the advice of
counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified parties or (z)
a conflict  or potential conflict exists or may exist (based upon advice of
counsel to an indemnified party) between such indemnified party and the other
indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying party shall be
obligated to pay the  reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel
or counsels.

3.9.4. _Contribution_. If for any reason the indemnification provided  for in
_Section 3.9.1_ and _Section 3.9.2_ is unavailable to an indemnified party or
insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to therein (other than as a
result of exceptions or limitations on indemnification contained in
_Section       3.9.1_ and _Section 3.9.2_ ), then the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the  indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified
party or parties on the other hand in connection with the acts, statements or
omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. In  connection with any Registration Statement
filed with the SEC by the Company, the relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand shall be
determined by reference to, among other things,  whether any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative 
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission, it being understood and agreed that, with respect
to each selling Holder, such information will be limited to such Holder's
Selling  Stockholder Information. The parties hereto agree that it would not
be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 3.9.4_ were
determined by _pro_ _rata_ allocation or by any other method of allocation
that  does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in
this _Section 3.9.4_. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution  from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a
result of the Losses referred to in _Sections 3.9.1_ and _3.9.2_ shall be
deemed to include, subject  to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 3.9.4_ ,  in connection with any Registration
Statement filed by the Company, a selling Holder shall not be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds from the
sale of its Registrable Securities in the offering  giving rise to such
indemnification obligation, net of underwriting discounts and commissions but
before expenses, less any amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to _Section
3.9.2_ and any amounts paid by such Holder as a result of  liabilities
incurred under the underwriting agreement, if any, related to such sale. If
indemnification is available under this _Section 3.9_ , the indemnifying
parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided 
in _Sections 3.9.1_ and _3.9.2_ hereof without regard to the provisions of
this _Section 3.9.4_. The remedies provided for in this _Section 3.9_ are not
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may  otherwise be
available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 26 -  


 

 

3.9.5. _Indemnification Priority_. The Company hereby acknowledges and 
agrees that any of the Persons entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 3.9.1_ (each, a "Company Indemnitee" and collectively, the "Company
Indemnitees")       may have certain rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by other sources. The
Company hereby acknowledges and agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first
resort (i.e., its obligations to a Company  Indemnitee are primary and any
obligation of such other sources to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such Company
Indemnitee are secondary) and (ii) that it shall be required to  advance the
full amount of expenses incurred by a Company Indemnitee and shall be liable
for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts
paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the 
terms of this Agreement without regard to any rights a Company Indemnitee may
have against such other sources. The Company further agrees that no
advancement or payment by such other sources on behalf of a Company Indemnitee
with respect to  any claim for which such Company Indemnitee has sought
indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance from the Company shall
affect the foregoing, and that such other sources shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to  the extent of such advancement or
payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Company Indemnitee against
the Company.

 


 

 

3.10. _Rules 144 and 144A and Regulation S_. The Company shall file the 
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the
Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any
Holder,  make publicly available such necessary information for so long as
necessary to permit sales that would otherwise be permitted by this Agreement
pursuant to Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as
such rules may be  amended from time to time or any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC), and it will take such further action
as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such Holder to sell  Registrable Securities without
Registration under the Securities Act in transactions that would otherwise be
permitted by this Agreement and within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by (i) Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S under the  Securities
Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule
or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of any Holder,
the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it 
has complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof.

 


 

 

3.11. _Existing Registration Statements_. Notwithstanding anything  herein to
the contrary and subject to applicable law and regulation, the Company may
satisfy any obligation hereunder to file a Registration Statement or to have a
Registration Statement become effective by a specified date by designating,
by  notice to the Holders, a Registration Statement that previously has been
filed with the SEC or become effective, as the case may be, as the relevant
Registration Statement for purposes of satisfying such obligation, and all
references to any  such obligation shall be construed accordingly; _provided_
that such previously filed Registration Statement may be, and is, amended or,
subject to applicable securities laws, supplemented to add the number of
Registrable Securities,  and, to the extent necessary, to identify as selling
stockholders those Holders demanding the filing of a Registration Statement
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. To the extent this Agreement refers
to the filing or effectiveness of  other Registration Statements, by or at a
specified time and the Company has, in lieu of then filing such Registration
Statements or having such Registration Statements become effective, designated
a previously filed or effective Registration  Statement as the relevant
Registration Statement for such purposes, in accordance with the preceding
sentence, such references shall be construed to refer to such designated
Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented in the manner 
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.

4.3. _Board Observer Rights_. For so long as the Pfizer Post-Closing

observer (in such capacity, a "Non-Voting Observer"); _provided_ ,  that the
Non-Voting Observer shall enter into a customary confidentiality agreement
with the Company on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, which shall be
no less favorable to the Company than the confidentiality provisions
applicable  to the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder under _Section 4.7._
Notice of the time and place of each such meeting shall be given to the Non-
Voting Observer in the same manner and at the same time as notice is given to
the Directors. The  Non-Voting Observer shall be given copies of all notices,
reports, minutes, consents and other documents and materials at the time and
in the manner as are provided to the Board or the applicable committee
thereof. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the Non-Voting Observer may be
excluded from access to the portion of any meeting of the Board or any
committee thereof or the portion of material relating thereto if the Board or
such committee reasonably determines in good faith  that such access would be
reasonably likely to (a) prevent the members of the Board or such committee
from engaging in attorney-client privileged communication with counsel, or (b)
result in a material conflict of interest with the Company or  one or more of
its subsidiaries, so long as, in each case, the Company promptly notifies the
Non-Voting Observer of such determination and provides the Non-Voting Observer
a general description of the information or materials that have been 
withheld to the extent that providing such description does not jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege to be preserved or result in the material conflict
to be avoided (it being understood and agreed that the Company will take, and
will  cause its subsidiaries to take, reasonable steps to minimize any such
exclusions).

 


 

 

4.4. _Director Expenses_. The Company shall pay the reasonable  out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Directors and the Non-Voting Observer, as
applicable, in connection with (a) attending the meetings of the Board and all
committees thereof, and (b) attending the meetings of any board of  directors
or similar governing body of any subsidiary of the Company and all committees
thereof.

 


 

 

4.5. _Preemptive Rights_.

 


 

 

4.5.1. _Rights to Purchase New Securities_. At any time after the Closing 
Date, in the event that the Company proposes to issue New Securities, each of
the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder and the
Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders shall have the right to purchase, in lieu
of the  Person to whom the Company proposed to issue such New Securities, in
accordance with _Section 4.5.2_ below, a number of New Securities equal to the
product of (i) the aggregate number or amount of New Securities which the
Company  proposes to issue at such time and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock then held by the Bain
Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder or the
Perceptive Post-Closing  Shareholders, as applicable, and the denominator of
which is the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (the
applicable fraction referred to in clause (ii), the "Preemptive Proportion").

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 30 -  


 

 

4.5.2. Subject to the provisions of _Section 4.5.3_ , in the event that  the
Company proposes to undertake an issuance of New Securities, it shall provide
written notice (a "Notice of Issuance") of such intention to the Bain Post-
Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing  Shareholder and the Perceptive
Post-Closing Shareholders indicating the exact price per New Security, the
exact number of New Securities to be issued by the Company and describing the
material terms of the New Securities and the material  terms and conditions
upon which the Company proposes to issue such New Securities. Each of the Bain
Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder and the
Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders shall have five (5) Business Days  from
the date of receipt of the Notice of Issuance to agree to purchase all or a
portion of applicable Preemptive Proportion of New Securities (as determined
pursuant to _Section 4.5.1_ above), during which time such offer to purchase 
shall remain open and irrevocable, for the consideration and upon the terms
and conditions specified in the Notice of Issuance by providing written notice
to the Company and stating therein the quantity of New Securities to be
purchased by  the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing
Shareholder or the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders, as applicable. If any
of the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder or
the Perceptive Post-Closing  Shareholders exercises its or their right to
purchase New Securities pursuant to this _Section 4.5.2_ (each, an "Electing
Post-Closing Shareholder"), the purchase and sale of such New Securities 
shall close at the same time as the issuance of New Securities to any other
purchaser(s) thereof and, subject to the preceding sentence, shall be issued
on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as applicable to such
other  purchaser(s); _provided_ , that (i) such terms and conditions
applicable to any Electing Post-Closing Shareholder shall not include any
restrictions on the transferability of such New Securities or any standstill,
voting or other  restriction, (ii) each Electing Post-Closing Shareholder
shall not be required to make any representations and warranties except those
that relate solely to such Electing Post-Closing Shareholder, and solely with
respect to such Electing  Post-Closing Shareholder's organization, conflicts
and consents and authority to purchase such New Securities, and (iii) each
Electing Post-Closing Shareholder will not be required to undertake any
indemnification obligation. The rights  granted to the Bain Post-Closing
Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder and the Perceptive Post-
Closing Shareholders by the Company under this _Section 4.5.2_ shall terminate
if unexercised within five (5) Business Days after  receipt of the Notice of
Issuance referred to in this _Section 4.5.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if (a) the price or any other material term or
condition upon which the Company proposes to issue such New  Securities is
amended (either favorably or unfavorably) by the Company following the
delivery to the applicable Electing Post-Closing Shareholder of the Notice of
Issuance or (b) the offering of New Securities to which a Notice of Issuance 
relates is not completed within sixty (60) days from the delivery of such
notice to the applicable Electing Post-Closing Shareholder, such Electing
Post-Closing Shareholder's election with respect to the purchase of New
Securities covered by  such Notice of Issuance shall be void and such
Electing Post-Closing Shareholder's obligation to purchase the New Securities
subject to such Notice of Issuance shall be released, the Company shall be
obligated to deliver a new Notice of  Issuance to the Bain Post-Closing
Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder and the Perceptive Post-
Closing Shareholders, and each of the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the
Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder and the Perceptive  Post-Closing Shareholders
shall be entitled to make a new election with respect to the purchase by it or
them of New Securities covered by such Notice of Issuance within the five
(5)-Business Day period from the date of delivery of the new  Notice of
Issuance and otherwise in accordance with the procedure specified in the
second sentence of this _Section 4.5.2_.

 

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 31 -   
 

 

4.5.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section  4.5.2_
, if the Company proposes to issue New Securities in an Underwritten Public
Offering, the Notice of Issuance may, (i) in lieu of providing the price at
which the Company proposes to issue New Securities as a fixed dollar amount, 
provide a bona fide estimated range of prices within which the underwriter for
such offering reasonably estimates the shares will be priced and (ii) in lieu
of providing an exact number of New Securities to be issued by the Company in
such  offering, provide a bona fide estimated number the underwriter for such
offering reasonably estimates will be issued in such offering, inclusive of
any customary option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters
or agents in  such offering (the "Offering Size"). If the Bain Post-Closing
Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder or the Perceptive Post-
Closing Shareholders desires to exercise its or their rights under  this
_Section 4.5_ with respect to such Underwritten Public Offering, the
applicable Electing Post-Closing Shareholder shall be required to make an
election with respect to the purchase of up to a number of New Securities
being offered  equal to its Preemptive Proportion of the Offering Size at the
public offering price no later than the date and time that the underwriting
agreement related to the Underwritten Public Offering is executed and such
rights shall terminate if  unexercised by such date and time.

 


 

 

4.5.4. If an offering contemplated by _Section 4.5.3_ is not completed 
within sixty (60) days following the Notice of Issuance with respect thereto,
then the Company will be required to comply again with the provisions of
_Sections 4.5.2_ and _4.5.3_ in order to avail itself of the benefits of this
_Section        4.5.4_. In case an offering contemplated by this
_Section 4.5.4_ is consummated, each Electing Post-Closing Shareholder shall
be obligated to purchase its portion of the New Securities hereunder at the
closing of such offering if  and to the extent the conditions applicable to
the Electing Post-Closing Shareholder's obligations hereunder are met, and if
such conditions are not met and to the extent the applicable Electing Post-
Closing Shareholder exercises its rights  under this _Section 4.5_ , the
applicable Electing Post-Closing Shareholder shall purchase such shares as
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, and on the same terms and
subject to the same conditions that would be applicable to  the underwriters
in such offering; _provided_ , _however_ that (i) such terms and conditions
applicable to the Electing Post-Closing Shareholder shall not include any
restrictions on the transferability of such New Securities or  any
standstill, voting or other restrictions, it being understood that all
restrictions of such nature are contained in this Agreement, (ii) each
Electing Post-Closing Shareholder shall not be required to make any
representations and  warranties except those that relate solely to such
Electing Post-Closing Shareholder and solely with respect to such Electing
Post-Closing Shareholder's organization, conflicts and consents and authority
to purchase such New Securities and  (iii) the Electing Post-Closing
Shareholder shall not be required to undertake any indemnity obligations.

 


 

 

4.5.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to an Underwritten Public 
Offering that is consummated within one (1) year of the date of this
Agreement, to the extent the offer and sale of any New Securities in such
Underwritten Public Offering to the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer
Post-Closing  Shareholder or the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders
pursuant to this _Section 4.5_ would not comply with Rule 2010 of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Manual or applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, then the  Company shall not be required to make such
an offer and sale in such underwritten offering to the Bain Post-Closing
Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder or the Perceptive Post-
Closing Shareholders pursuant to this _Section 4.5_.  In such event, the
Company agrees that it will cooperate with the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder,
the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder and the Perceptive Post-Closing
Shareholders and will promptly take all actions to effect the offer and sale 
of securities to the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-Closing
Shareholder and the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders in an alternative
manner that complies with Rule 2010 of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority Manual  or applicable rules and regulations of the SEC so that the
intents and purposes of this _Section 4.5_ are effectuated, including without
limitation by offering the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the Pfizer Post-
Closing Shareholder and  the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders securities
in a private transaction that provides the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the
Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder and the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders
the opportunity to maintain its or  their pro rata stock ownership in the
Company.

 

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 32 -   
 

 

4.5.6. The provisions of this _Section 4.5_ shall terminate upon, (i) in  the
case of the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, the earlier to occur of the seventh
(7th) anniversary of the Closing Date and the date on which the Bain  Post-
Closing Shareholder beneficially owns less than fifty percent (50%) of the of
the Equivalent Shares held by it as of the Closing (either such occurrence, a
"Preemptive Right Termination Date"),  (ii) in the case of the Pfizer Post-
Closing Shareholder, the earlier to occur of the date on which the Pfizer
Post-Closing Shareholder beneficially owns less than fifty percent (50%) of
the of the Equivalent Shares held by it as of the  Closing and the Preemptive
Right Termination Date and, (iii) in the case of the Perceptive Post-Closing
Shareholders, the earlier to occur of the date on which the Perceptive Post-
Closing Shareholders beneficially own less than eighty percent  (80%) of the
Equivalent Shares held by them as of the Closing and the Preemptive Right
Termination Date. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.6_ hereto, (a)
the provisions of this _Section 4.5_ applicable to the Bain  Post-Closing
Shareholder may be waived in writing by the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder or
amended, modified or extended by an agreement in writing signed by the Company
and the Bain Post-Closing Shareholder, (b) the provisions of this
_Section       4.5_ applicable to the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder
may be waived in writing by the Pfizer Post-Closing Shareholder or amended,
modified or extended by an agreement in writing signed by the Company and the
Pfizer Post-Closing  Shareholder and (c) the provisions of this _Section 4.5_
applicable to the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders may be waived in
writing by the Perceptive Post-Closing Shareholders or amended, modified or
extended by an agreement in  writing signed by the Company and the Perceptive
Post-Closing Shareholders.

 


 

 

4.6. _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_. The Company will purchase, 
within a reasonable period following the Closing, and maintain for such
periods as the Board in good faith determines, at its expense, insurance in an
amount determined in good faith by the Board to be appropriate, but in any
event no less  than $[●] million per person, on behalf of any person who
after the Closing is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation,  partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company,
against any expense, liability or loss asserted against such Person and
incurred by such Person in any such capacity, or  arising out of such
Person's status as such, subject to customary exclusions, which insurance
shall cover such risks as are adequate and customary for the Company's size
and business, and shall be from financially sound and reputable  insurance
companies or associations. The Company hereby acknowledges that any director,
officer or other indemnified person covered by any such indemnity insurance
policy (any such Person, a "Covered  Indemnitee") may have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by any of
the Sponsor Investors and certain of their respective Affiliates
(collectively, the "Fund Indemnitors"). The Company hereby agrees (a) that the
Company shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to a
Covered Indemnitee shall be primary and any  obligation of any Fund
Indemnitor to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by Covered Indemnitee shall be secondary) and
(b) the Company irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the  Fund
Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Fund Indemnitors for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Fund
Indemnitors on  behalf of a Covered Indemnitee with respect to any claim for
which such Covered Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company
shall affect the foregoing and the Fund Indemnitors shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated  to the extent of such advancement or
payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Covered Indemnitee against
the Company. The provisions of this _Section 4.6_ will survive any termination
of this Agreement. Any Fund Indemnitor or  insurer thereof not a party to
this Agreement is an express third party beneficiary of this _Section 4.6_ ,
and is entitled to enforce this _Section 4.6_ according to its terms to the
same extent as if such Fund Indemnitor or  insurer thereof were a party
hereto.

4.7. _Confidentiality_. Each Investor agrees that it will keep  confidential
and will not disclose, divulge or use for any purpose, other than (x) to
monitor its investment in the Company and its subsidiaries and make investment
decisions with respect to the securities of the Company and (y) to engage in 
all uses and activities pursuant to, in connection with or contemplated by the
License Agreement, any confidential information obtained from the Company,
unless such confidential information (a) is known or becomes known to the
public (other  than as a result of a breach of this _Section 4.7_ by such
Investor or its Affiliates), (b) is or has been independently developed or
conceived by such Investor without use of the Company's confidential
information or (c) is or has been  made known or disclosed to such Investor
by a third party (other than an Affiliate of such Investor) without a breach
of any obligation of confidentiality such third party may have; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that an Investor may  disclose confidential information (i) to
its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals to the extent
necessary to obtain their services in connection with monitoring its
investment in the Company or engaging in all uses and  activities pursuant
to, in connection with or contemplated by the License Agreement, (ii) to any
prospective purchaser of any Shares from such Investor in any Transfer
permitted under this Agreement as long as such prospective purchaser  agrees
prior to such disclosure to be bound by a confidentiality agreement no less
favorable to the Company than the provisions of this _Section 4.7_ , (iii) to
any Affiliate, partner, member or related investment fund of such Investor 
and their respective directors, employees and consultants, in each case in the
ordinary course of business, (iv) as may be reasonably determined by such
Investor to be necessary in connection with such Investor's enforcement of its
rights in  connection with this Agreement or its investment in the Company
and its subsidiaries or (v) as may otherwise be required by law or legal,
judicial or regulatory process or requested by any regulatory or self-
regulatory authority or examiner,  provided that such Investor takes
reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any required disclosure described
in this clause (v); and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the
disclosing Investor shall cause any Person to  whom such Investor may
disclose confidential information pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of the
first proviso of this sentence to comply with this _Section 4.7_ as if such
Person was a party hereto; and _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that the
acts and omissions of any Person to whom such Investor may disclose
confidential information pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of the first
proviso of this sentence will be attributable to such Investor for  purposes
of determining such Investor's compliance with this _Section 4.7_. Each party
hereto acknowledges that the Sponsor Investors or any of their Affiliates and
related investment funds may review the business plans and related 
proprietary information of many enterprises, including enterprises which may
have products or services which compete directly or indirectly with those of
the Company and its subsidiaries, and may trade in the securities of such
enterprises.   Nothing in this _Section 4.7_ (except as set forth in the
second proviso of the preceding sentence) will preclude or in any way restrict
the Sponsor Investors or their Affiliates or related investment funds from
investing or  participating in any particular enterprise, or trading in the
securities thereof, whether or not such enterprise has products or services
that compete with those of the Company and its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything  else to the contrary in this Agreement, each party
(and each employee, representative or other agent of any party) may disclose
to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and
tax structure of, and tax strategies  relating to, the transactions in which
such party participates pursuant to this Agreement. For this purpose, "tax
structure" is limited to any facts relevant to the United States federal
income tax treatment of such transactions and does not  include information
relating to the specific identity of the parties.

 


 

 


 

 

 

\- 34 -  

4.8. _Other Business Opportunities_. To the fullest extent permitted by  law,
the doctrine of corporate opportunity and any analogous doctrine will not
apply to (a) any Sponsor Investor, (b) any member of the Board, Non-Voting
Observer or officer of the Company who is not a full-time employee of the
Company or any  of its operating subsidiaries or (c) any Affiliate, partner,
advisory board member, director, officer, manager, member or shareholder of
any Sponsor Investor who is not a full-time employee of the Company or any of
its operating subsidiaries  (any such Person listed in (a), (b) or (c), an
"External Party"). The Company renounces any interest or expectancy of the
Company in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business 
opportunities that are from time to time presented to any External Party. Each
External Party who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement,
arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Company (i)
will not  have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the
Company and (ii) will not be liable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or to the stockholders of the Company or any of its subsidiaries because such
External Party pursues  or acquires for, or directs such opportunity to,
itself or another Person or does not communicate such opportunity or
information to the Company.

 


 

 

4.9. _Other Business Activities of Sponsor Investors_. The Company 
acknowledges that certain of the Sponsor Investors and their respective
Affiliates are in the business of investing and therefore review the business
plans and related proprietary information of many enterprises, including
enterprises that  may have products or services that compete directly or
indirectly with those of the Company. Subject to compliance with the express
terms of this Agreement and each other agreement related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  (collectively, the "Transaction Agreements"),
the Sponsor Investors shall not be precluded or in any way restricted from
investing or participating in any particular enterprise, whether or not such 
enterprise has products or services that compete with those of the Company.
Further, the Company and each Investor acknowledges and agrees that (i)
certain of the Sponsor Investors (or the Affiliates of such Sponsor Investors)
(each, a "Strategic Investor") may presently have, or may engage in the future
in, internal development programs, or may receive information from third
parties that relates to, and may develop and commercialize  products
independently or in cooperation with such third parties, that are similar to
or that are directly or indirectly competitive with, the Company's development
programs, products or services, and (ii) any employee of such Strategic 
Investor serving on the Board is serving in such capacity at the request, and
for the benefit, of the Company. Accordingly, such Strategic Investor's
designation of any Director to the Board, the service of such Director on the
Board, the  role of a Non-Voting Observer in accordance with the terms hereof
or the exercise by such Strategic Investor of any rights under this Agreement
or any of the Transaction Agreements, shall not (subject to compliance with
the express terms of  this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement) in
any way preclude or restrict such Strategic Investor from conducting any
development program, commercializing any product or service or otherwise
engaging in any enterprise, whether or  not such development program,
product, service or enterprise, competes with those of the Company, so long as
such activities do not result in a violation of the confidentiality provisions
of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.   Nothing herein or in
any other Transaction Agreement shall be construed to impose on such Strategic
Investor, or any Director nominated by a Strategic Investor, or Non-Voting
Observer, any restriction, duty or obligation other than as  expressly set
forth herein or therein.

and any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing shall

taken together shall constitute one instrument. The parties hereto agree that

  1 As contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, each Supporting

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises set
forth herein and for other good  and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, each intending to
be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 


 

 

AGREEMENT

 


 

 

1. _Company Shareholder Consent and Related Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event  within two (2)
Business Days) following the time at which the Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Shareholder
shall duly execute and deliver to the Company and ARYA the Company
Shareholder  Written Consent under which it shall irrevocably and
unconditionally consent to the matters, actions and proposals contemplated by
Section 5.13(b) (Transaction Support Agreements; Company Shareholder Approval;
Subscription Agreements) of the  Business Combination Agreement. As promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the earlier of (x) the
time at which the Company delivers the Allocation Schedule to ARYA pursuant to
the Business Combination Agreement or (y) the  time at which the Company is
required to deliver to the Allocation Schedule to ARYA pursuant to the
Business Combination Agreement), the Stockholder shall (i) duly execute and
deliver to the Company and ARYA a written consent, in accordance with  the
DGCL, the Company's Governing Documents and the Company Shareholders
Agreement, under which it irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the
matters, actions and proposals contemplated by Section 5.13(d)(i) (Transaction
Support Agreements;  Company Shareholder Approval; Subscription Agreements)
of the Business Combination Agreement or (ii) execute and deliver all
additional agreements, documents and instruments and take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary or reasonably  advisable in order to amend or
otherwise modify the Governing Documents of the Company, the Company
Shareholders Agreement and each other applicable Contract in the manner
required by Section 5.13(d)(ii) (Transaction Support Agreements; Company 
Shareholder Approval; Subscription Agreements) of the Business Combination
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the first two sentences of this
_Section 1(a)_ , prior to the Closing, the Shareholder shall vote (or cause to
be  voted) the Subject Company Shares against and withhold consent with
respect to (A) any Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) any other matter,
action or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in (x) a breach
of any of the Company's  covenants, agreements or obligations under the
Business Combination Agreement or (y) any of the conditions to the Closing set
forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 of the Business Combination Agreement not being
satisfied.

 


 

 

(b) Without limiting any other rights or remedies of ARYA,  the Shareholder
hereby irrevocably appoints ARYA or any individual designated by ARYA as the
Shareholder's agent, attorney-in-fact and proxy (with full power of
substitution and resubstituting), for and in the name, place and stead of
the  Shareholder, to attend on behalf of the Shareholder any meeting of the
Company Shareholders with respect to the matters described in _Section 1(a)_ ,
to include the Subject Company Shares in any computation for purposes of
establishing a  quorum at any such meeting of the Company Shareholders, to
vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject Company Shares or consent (or withhold
consent) with respect to any of the matters described in _Section 1(a)_ in
connection with any meeting  of the Company Shareholders or any action by
written consent by the Company Shareholders (including the Company Shareholder
Written Consent), in each case, in the event that the Shareholder fails to
perform or otherwise comply with the covenants,  agreements or obligations
set forth in _Section 1(a)_.

 


 

 

(c) The proxy granted by the Shareholder pursuant to _Section      
1(b)_ is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
proxy and is granted in consideration for ARYA entering into the Business
Combination Agreement and agreeing to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby.   The proxy granted by the Shareholder pursuant to _Section 1(b)_ is
also a durable proxy and shall survive the bankruptcy, dissolution, death,
incapacity or other inability to act by the Shareholder and shall revoke any
and all prior proxies  granted by the Shareholder with respect to the Subject
Company Shares. The vote or consent of the proxyholder in accordance with
_Section 1(b)_ and with respect to the matters in _Section 1(a)_ shall control
in the event of any  conflict between such vote or consent by the proxyholder
of the Subject Company Shares and a vote or consent by the Shareholder of the
Subject Company Shares (or any other Person with the power to vote the Subject
Company Shares) with respect to  the matters in _Section 1(a)_. The
proxyholder may not exercise the proxy granted pursuant to _Section 1(b)_ on
any matter except those provided in _Section 1(a)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Shareholder may vote the  Subject Company Shares on all other
matters, subject to, for the avoidance of doubt, the other applicable
covenants, agreements and obligations set forth in this Agreement.

 


 

 


 

 

 

2  


 

 

2. _Other Covenants and Agreements_.

 


 

 

(a) The Shareholder hereby agrees that, notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in any such agreement, (i) each of the agreements set forth on
_Schedule B_ hereto shall be automatically terminated and of no further force
and effect (including any provisions of any such agreement that, by its 
terms, survive such termination) effective as of, and subject to and
conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Closing and (ii) upon such termination
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates (including the other Group
Companies and, from and  after the Effective Time, ARYA and its Affiliates)
shall have any further obligations or liabilities under each such agreement;
_provided_ , however, that the indemnification provisions that are
contemplated to survive the agreement marked  with an asterisk (*) on
_Schedule B_ shall survive such termination in accordance with their terms.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder hereby
agrees to promptly execute and deliver all additional agreements,  documents
and instruments and take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
reasonably advisable in order to achieve the purpose of the preceding
sentence.

 


 

 

(b) The Shareholder shall be bound by and subject to (i)  Sections 5.3(a)
(Confidentiality) and 5.4(a) (Public Announcements) of the Business
Combination Agreement to the same extent as such provisions apply to the
parties to the Business Combination Agreement, as if the Shareholder is
directly party  thereto, and (ii) the first sentence of Section 5.6(a)
(Exclusive Dealing) and Section 8.18 (Trust Account Waiver) of the Business
Combination Agreement to the same extent as such provisions apply to the
Company, as if the Shareholder is directly  party thereto.

 


 

 

(c) The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that ARYA and the  other ARYA
Parties are entering into the Business Combination Agreement in reliance upon
the Shareholder entering into this Agreement and agreeing to be bound by, and
perform, or otherwise comply with, as applicable, the agreements, covenants
and  obligations contained in this Agreement and but for the Shareholder
entering into this Agreement and agreeing to be bound by, and perform, or
otherwise comply with, as applicable, the agreements, covenants and
obligations contained in this  Agreement ARYA and the other ARYA Parties
would not have entered into or agreed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.

 


 

 

3. _Shareholder Representations and Warranties_. The  Shareholder represents and warrants to ARYA as follows:

 


 

 

(a) The Shareholder is a corporation, limited liability  company or other
applicable business entity duly organized or formed, as applicable, validly
existing and in good standing (or the equivalent thereof, if applicable, in
each case, with respect to the jurisdictions that recognize the concept of 
good standing or any equivalent thereof) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
formation or organization (as applicable).

 


 

 

(b) The Shareholder has the requisite corporate, limited  liability company
or other similar power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, those covenants, agreements and obligations 
hereunder that relate to the provisions of the Business Combination
Agreement), and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate (or other  similar) action on the part of the
Shareholder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Shareholder and constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of the
Shareholder (assuming that this Agreement is duly  authorized, executed and
delivered by ARYA), enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its
terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws affecting generally the enforcement of  creditors'
rights and subject to general principles of equity).

 


 

 


 

 

 

3  


 

 

(c) No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation,  declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of the
Shareholder with respect to the Shareholder's execution, delivery or
performance of its covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement
(including, for  the avoidance of doubt, those covenants, agreements and
obligations under this Agreement that relate to the provisions of the Business
Combination Agreement) or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for any consents,  approvals, authorizations, designations,
declarations, waivers or filings, the absence of which would not adversely
affect the ability of the Shareholder to perform, or otherwise comply with,
any of its covenants, agreements or obligations  hereunder in any material
respect.

 


 

 

(d) None of the execution or delivery of this Agreement by  the Shareholder,
the performance by the Shareholder of any of its covenants, agreements or
obligations under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those
covenants, agreements and obligations under this Agreement that relate to 
the provisions of the Business Combination Agreement) or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will, directly or indirectly (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) (i) result in any breach of any
provision of the  Shareholder's Governing Documents, (ii) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute a default or give rise to any right of
termination, Consent, cancellation, amendment, modification, suspension,
revocation or acceleration under, any of the  terms, conditions or provisions
of any Contract to which the Shareholder is a party, (iii) violate, or
constitute a breach under, any Order or applicable Law to which the
Shareholder or any of its properties or assets are bound or (iv) result in 
the creation of any Lien upon the Subject Company Shares, except, in the case
of any of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ above, as would not adversely affect the
ability of the Shareholder to perform, or otherwise comply with, any of its 
covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder in any material respect.

 


 

 

(e) The Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner of the  Subject
Company Shares and has valid, good and marketable title to the Subject Company
Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than transfer restrictions under
applicable Securities Law or under the Company Shareholders Agreement). Except
for  the Equity Securities of the Company set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto,
together with any other Equity Securities of the Company that the Shareholder
acquires record or beneficial ownership after the date hereof that is either
permitted  pursuant to, or acquired in accordance with, Section 5.1(b)(iv) of
the Business Combination Agreement, the Shareholder does not own, beneficially
or of record, any Equity Securities of any Group Company. Except as otherwise
expressly  contemplated by the Company Shareholders Agreement or the Pre-
Closing Series A Purchase Agreement and any related acknowledgement agreement
existing on the date hereof and made available to ARYA or that is entered into
in accordance with the  Business Combination Agreement and the Bain
Subscription Agreement, the Shareholder does not have the right to acquire any
Equity Securities of any Group Company. The Shareholder has the sole right to
vote (and provide consent in respect of, as  applicable) the Subject Company
Shares and, except for this Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement and
the Company Shareholders Agreement, the Shareholder is not party to or bound
by (i) any option, warrant, purchase right, or other  Contract that would
(either alone or in connection with one or more events, developments or events
(including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions precedent)) require
the Shareholder to Transfer any of the Subject Company Shares or (ii)  any
voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect to the voting or Transfer
of any of the Subject Company Shares.

 


 

 

(f) There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Shareholder's  knowledge,
threatened against the Shareholder that, if adversely decided or resolved,
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of the
Shareholder to perform, or otherwise comply with, any of its covenants,
agreements or  obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

 


 

 

(g) The Shareholder, on his, her or its own behalf and on  behalf of his, her
or its Representatives, acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees that (i)
he, she or it has conducted his, her or its own independent review and
analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment 
concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of, the
ARYA Parties and (ii) he, she or it has been furnished with or given access to
such documents and information about the ARYA Parties and their respective
businesses and  operations as he, she or it and his, her or its
Representatives have deemed necessary to enable him, her or it to make an
informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, the other Ancillary Documents  to which he, she or it is or
will be a party and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 


 

 


 

 

 

4  


 

 

(h) In entering into this Agreement and the other Ancillary  Documents to
which he, she or it is or will be a party, the Shareholder has relied solely
on his, her or its own investigation and analysis and the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in the Ancillary Documents to which he, she
or  it is or will be a party and no other representations or warranties of
any ARYA Party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the
representations or warranties of any ARYA Party set forth in the Business
Combination Agreement or any other  Ancillary Document), any ARYA Non-Party
Affiliate or any other Person, either express or implied, and the Shareholder,
on his, her or its own behalf and on behalf of his, her or its
Representatives, acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees  that, except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in the Ancillary
Documents to which he, she or it is or will be a party, none of the ARYA
Parties, any ARYA Non-Party Affiliate or any other Person makes or has made
any  representation or warranty, either express or implied, in connection
with or related to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents to which he, she or
it is or will be a party or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 


 

 

4. _Transfer of Subject Securities_. Except as  expressly contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement or with the prior written consent of ARYA (such consent to be given or withheld in its sole discretion), from and after the date hereof, the Shareholder agrees not to (a) Transfer any  of the Subject Company Shares, (b) enter into (i) any option, warrant, purchase right, or other Contract that would (either alone or in connection with one or more events, developments or events (including the satisfaction or waiver of any  conditions precedent)) require the Shareholder to Transfer the Subject Company Shares or (ii) any voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect to the voting or Transfer of the Subject Company Shares, or (c) take any actions in furtherance  of any of the matters described in the foregoing _clauses (a)_ or _(b)_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Transfer_ " means any, direct or indirect, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, mortgage, exchange, hypothecation, grant of  a security interest in or disposition or encumbrance of an interest (whether with or without consideration, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law or otherwise).

 


 

 

5. _Termination_. This Agreement shall automatically terminate, without any  notice or other action by any Party, and be void ab initio upon the earlier of (a) the Effective Time; and (b) the termination of the Business Combination Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon  termination of this Agreement as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, none of the Parties shall have any further obligations or Liabilities under, or with respect to, this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the  contrary in this Agreement, (i) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ shall not affect any Liability on the part of any Party for a Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement prior to such  termination or Fraud, (ii) _Section 2(b)(i)_ (solely to the extent that it relates to Section 5.3(a) (Confidentiality) of the Business Combination Agreement) and the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3(g)_ and _(h)_   shall each survive any termination of this Agreement, (iii) _Section 2(b)(i)_ (solely to the extent that it relates to Section 5.4(a) (Public Announcements) of the Business Combination Agreement) shall survive the termination of this  Agreement pursuant to _Section 5(a)_ and (iv) _Section 2(b)(ii)_ (solely to the extent that it relates to Section 8.18 (Trust Account Waiver) of the Business Combination Agreement) shall survive the termination of this Agreement  pursuant to _Section 5(b)_. For purposes of this _Section 5_ , (x) " _Willful Breach_ " means a material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken or a failure to act by the breaching Party with the knowledge that the  taking of such act or such failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute or result in a breach of this Agreement and (y) " _Fraud_ " means an act or omission committed by a Party, and requires: (A) a false or incorrect  representation or warranty expressly set forth in this Agreement, (B) with actual knowledge (as opposed to constructive, imputed or implied knowledge) by the Party making such representation or warranty that such representation or warranty  expressly set forth in this Agreement is false or incorrect, (C) an intention to deceive another Party, to induce him, her or it to enter into this Agreement, (D) another Party, in justifiable or reasonable reliance upon such false or incorrect  representation or warranty expressly set forth in this Agreement, causing such Party to enter into this Agreement, and (E) another Party to suffer damage by reason of such reliance. For the avoidance of doubt, "Fraud" does not include any claim  for equitable fraud, promissory fraud, unfair dealings fraud or any torts (including a claim for fraud or alleged fraud) based on negligence or recklessness.

 


 

 


 

 

 

5  


 

 

6. _Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, (a) the Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in such Shareholder's capacity as a record holder and beneficial owner of the Subject Company Shares[, and not in such Shareholder's capacity as a  director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or in such Shareholder's capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any Company Equity Plan,]2  and (b) nothing herein will be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by [such Shareholder]3 // [any representative of such Shareholder serving]4 as a member of the board of directors of any Group Company or as an officer, employee or fiduciary of any Group Company, in each case, acting in such person's  capacity as a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of such Group Company.

 


 

 

7. _No Recourse_. Except for claims pursuant to the Business Combination  Agreement or any other Ancillary Document by any party(ies) thereto against any other party(ies) thereto, each Party agrees that (a) this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any action for breach of this Agreement may only be made  against, the Parties, and no claims of any nature whatsoever (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising under or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation hereof or its subject matter, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be  asserted against the Company or any Company Non-Party Affiliate (other than the Shareholder named as a party hereto, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein) or any ARYA Non-Party Affiliate, and (b) none of the Company, any  Company Non-Party Affiliates (other than the Shareholder named as a party hereto, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein) or any ARYA Non-Party Affiliate shall have any Liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement,  the negotiation hereof or its subject matter, or the transactions contemplated hereby, including with respect to any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in respect of any written or oral representations  made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, as expressly provided herein, or for any actual or alleged inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to any information or materials of any kind furnished in connection with this  Agreement, the negotiation hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

 

8. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other  communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been duly given) by delivery in person, by facsimile (having obtained electronic delivery confirmation thereof) if applicable, e-mail (having obtained  electronic delivery confirmation thereof (i.e., an electronic record of the sender that the email was sent to the intended recipient thereof without an "error" or similar message that such email was not received by such intended recipient)), or  by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) (upon receipt thereof) to the other Parties as follows:

9. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Business  Combination Agreement and documents referred to herein and therein constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,  among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

 


 

 

10. _Amendments and Waivers; Assignment_. Any provision  of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by the Shareholder and ARYA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall  operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be  assignable by the Shareholder without ARYA's prior written consent (to be withheld or given in its sole discretion).

 


 

 

11. _Fees and Expenses_.

12. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided  herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise  of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that either Party does not perform its respective obligations under the  provisions of this Agreement in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief  to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages and this being in addition to any other remedy to which  they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that  the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 


 

 

13. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement  shall be for the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and is not intended, nor shall be construed, to give any Person, other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, any legal or  equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever by reason this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall constitute the Parties, partners or participants in a joint venture.

5. _Removal_. Subject to the rights, if any, of any series  of Undesignated Preferred Stock to elect Directors and to remove any Director whom the holders of any such series have the right to elect and subject to the terms of the Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, any Director (including  persons elected by Directors to fill vacancies in the Board of Directors) may be removed from office (i) only with cause and (ii) only by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital  stock then entitled to vote at an election of Directors.

2. _Amendment by Stockholders_.

corporate  action not caused, directly or indirectly, by such person. For the
purpose of determining whether a person is an interested stockholder, the

or consent solicitation made to ten (10) or more persons; or

SECTION 1. Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders (any such
meeting  being referred to in these By-laws as an "Annual Meeting") shall be
held at the hour, date and place within or without the United States which is
fixed by the Board of Directors, which time, date and place may subsequently
be changed at any  time by vote of the Board of Directors. If no Annual
Meeting has been held for a period of thirteen (13) months after the
Corporation's last Annual Meeting, a special meeting in lieu thereof may be
held, and such special meeting shall have,  for the purposes of these By-laws
or otherwise, all the force and effect of an Annual Meeting. Any and all
references hereafter in these By-laws to an Annual Meeting or Annual Meetings
also shall be deemed to refer to any special meeting(s) in  lieu thereof.

 


 

 

SECTION 2. Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations.

(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of  Directors of the
Corporation and the proposal of other business to be considered by the
stockholders may be brought before an Annual Meeting (i) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who  was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice
provided for in this By-law, who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who is
present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting and who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this  By-law as to such nomination or
business. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (ii) shall be the
exclusive means for a stockholder to bring nominations or business properly
before an Annual Meeting (other than matters properly  brought under Rule
14a-8 (or any successor rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")), and such stockholder must comply with the
notice and other procedures set forth in Article I, Section 2(a)(2) and (3) 
of this By-law to bring such nominations or business properly before an Annual
Meeting. In addition to the other requirements set forth in this By-law, for
any proposal of business to be considered at an Annual Meeting, it must be a
proper  subject for action by stockholders of the Corporation under Delaware
law.

 


 

     


 

 


 

 

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought  before an
Annual Meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (ii) of Article I, Section

have provided any updates or supplements to such notice at the times and in

owner(s), if any, on whose behalf the nomination or business proposal is made,
have acted in  accordance with the representations set forth in the
Solicitation Statement (as defined below) required by this By-law. To be
timely, a stockholder's written notice shall be received by the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the  Corporation not later than the close
of business on the ninetieth (90th) day nor earlier than the close of business
on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior  to the one-year anniversary
of the preceding year's Annual Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event the Annual Meeting is first convened more than thirty (30) days before
or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary  date, or if no Annual
Meeting were held in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be
timely must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the
close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to  the
scheduled date of such Annual Meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made
(such notice within such time periods shall be referred to as "Timely
Notice").   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, for the
first Annual Meeting following the initial public offering of common stock of
the Corporation, a stockholder's notice shall be timely if received by the
Secretary at the  principal executive offices of the Corporation not later
than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to

Shareholder Rights Agreement") shall be eligible for election and to serve as
directors and only such business shall be conducted at an Annual Meeting as
shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions
of this  By-law, the Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement or in

designated committee thereof shall have the power to determine whether a
nomination or any business  proposed to be brought before the meeting was
made in accordance with the provisions of this By-law or the Registration and
Shareholder Rights Agreement. If neither the Board of Directors nor such
designated committee makes a determination as  to whether any stockholder
proposal or nomination was made in accordance with the provisions of this By-
law or the Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, the presiding
officer of the Annual Meeting shall have the power and duty to  determine
whether the stockholder proposal or nomination was made in accordance with the
provisions of this By-law or the Registration and Shareholder Rights
Agreement. If the Board of Directors or a designated committee thereof or
the  presiding officer, as applicable, determines that any stockholder
proposal or nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this
By-law or the Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement, such proposal or
nomination shall be  disregarded and shall not be presented for action at the
Annual Meeting.

(2) Except as otherwise required by law or the Registration  and Shareholder

other stockholder communication distributed on behalf of the Corporation or
the  Board of Directors information with respect to any nominee for director
or any other matter of business submitted by a stockholder.

 


 

 

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article  I, Section 2,
if the nominating or proposing stockholder (or a qualified representative of
the stockholder) does not appear at the Annual Meeting to present a nomination
or any business, such nomination or business shall be disregarded, 
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by
the Corporation. For purposes of this Article I, Section 2, to be considered a

authorized by  a written instrument executed by such stockholder or an
electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such
stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must
produce such written instrument or electronic  transmission, or a reliable
reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, to the
presiding officer at the meeting of stockholders.

 


 

 

(4) For purposes of this By-law, "public announcement" shall  mean disclosure

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-law,  a stockholder
shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this
By-law. Nothing in this By-law shall be deemed to affect any rights of  (i)
stockholders to have proposals included in the Corporation's proxy statement
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor rule), as applicable, under the
Exchange Act and, to the extent required by such rule, have such proposals
considered and  voted on at an Annual Meeting or (ii) the holders of any
series of Undesignated Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified
circumstances.

not  less than two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock
entitled to vote thereon, and the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds
(2/3) of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a
class, shall be  required to amend or repeal any provision of this Article I,
Section 2; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Board of Directors recommends
that stockholders approve such amendment or repeal at such meeting of
stockholders, such  amendment or repeal shall only require the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such
amendment or repeal, voting together as a single class.

 


 

 

SECTION 3. Special Meetings. Except as otherwise required by statute and 
subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Undesignated
Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may
be called only by the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution
approved by the  affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors then in
office. The Board of Directors may postpone or reschedule any previously
scheduled special meeting of stockholders. Only those matters set forth in the
notice of the special meeting may  be considered or acted upon at a special
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. Nominations of persons for
election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and stockholder
proposals of other business shall not be brought before a  special meeting of
stockholders to be considered by the stockholders unless such special meeting
is held in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with
Article I, Section 1 of these By-laws, in which case such special meeting  in
lieu thereof shall be deemed an Annual Meeting for purposes of these By-laws
and the provisions of Article I, Section 2 of these By-laws shall govern such
special meeting.

less than two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled
to vote  thereon, and the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds (2/3)
of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class,
shall be required to amend or repeal any provision of this Article I, Section
3; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that if the Board of Directors recommends that
stockholders approve such amendment or repeal at such meeting of stockholders,
such amendment or repeal shall only require the affirmative vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares entitled to  vote on such amendment or repeal,
voting together as a single class.

 


 

 

SECTION 4. Notice of Meetings; Adjournments.

 


 

 

(a) A notice of each Annual Meeting stating the hour, date and place, if any,
of  such Annual Meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by

manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware  General Corporation Law
("DGCL").

 


 

 

(b) Unless otherwise required by the DGCL, notice of all special meetings of 
stockholders shall be given in the same manner as provided for Annual
Meetings, except that the notice of all special meetings shall state the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting has been called.

 


 

 

(c) Notice of an Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders need not
be  given to a stockholder if a waiver of notice is executed, or waiver of
notice by electronic transmission is provided, before or after such meeting by
such stockholder or if such stockholder attends such meeting, unless such
attendance is for  the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not
lawfully called or convened.

 


 

 

(d) The Board of Directors may postpone and reschedule any previously
scheduled  Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders and any record
date with respect thereto, regardless of whether any notice or public
disclosure with respect to any such meeting has been sent or made pursuant to
Section 2 of this Article I of  these By-laws or otherwise. In no event shall
the public announcement of an adjournment, postponement or rescheduling of any
previously scheduled meeting of stockholders commence a new time period for
the giving of a stockholder's notice under  this Article I of these By-laws.

(e) When any meeting is convened, the presiding officer may adjourn the
meeting  if (i) no quorum is present for the transaction of business, (ii)
the Board of Directors determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate
to enable the stockholders to consider fully information which the Board of
Directors determines  has not been made sufficiently or timely available to
stockholders, or (iii) the Board of Directors determines that adjournment is
otherwise in the best interests of the Corporation. When any Annual Meeting or
special meeting of stockholders  is adjourned to another hour, date or place,
notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting other than an announcement
at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken of the hour, date and place,
if any, to which the meeting is adjourned  and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting; provided, however,
that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days from  the meeting
date, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed
to be  present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat and each stockholder who,
by law or under the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as the
same may hereafter  be amended and/or restated, the "Certificate") or these
By-laws, is entitled to such notice.

 


 

 

SECTION 5. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, 
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any
meeting of stockholders. If less than a quorum is present at a meeting, the
holders of voting stock representing a majority of the voting power present at
the meeting  or the presiding officer may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice, except
as provided in Section 4 of this Article I. At such adjourned meeting at which
a quorum is present, any  business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the original meeting. The stockholders present at a duly
constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough  stockholders to leave less than a
quorum.

 


 

 

SECTION 6. Voting and Proxies. Stockholders shall have one vote for each
share  of stock entitled to vote owned by them of record according to the
stock ledger of the Corporation as of the record date, unless otherwise
provided by law or by the Certificate. Stockholders may vote either (i) in
person, (ii) by written proxy  or (iii) by a transmission permitted by
Section 212(c) of the DGCL. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission permitted by Section
212(c) of the DGCL may be substituted for or used in  lieu of the original
writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original
writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of 
the entire original writing or transmission. Proxies shall be filed in
accordance with the procedures established for the meeting of stockholders.
Except as otherwise limited therein or as otherwise provided by law, proxies
authorizing a  person to vote at a specific meeting shall entitle the persons
authorized thereby to vote at any adjournment of such meeting, but they shall
not be valid after final adjournment of such meeting. A proxy with respect to
stock held in the name  of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by
or on behalf of any one of them unless at or prior to the exercise of the
proxy the Corporation receives a specific written notice to the contrary from
any one of them.

SECTION 7. Action at Meeting. When a quorum is present at any meeting of 
stockholders, any matter before any such meeting (other than an election of a
director or directors) shall be decided by a majority of the votes properly
cast for and against such matter, except where a larger vote is required by
law, by the  Certificate or by these By-laws. Any election of directors by
stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes properly cast on
the election of directors.

 


 

 

SECTION 8. Stockholder Lists. The Secretary or an Assistant Secretary (or
the  Corporation's transfer agent or other person authorized by these By-laws
or by law) shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every Annual
Meeting or special meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to  vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical
order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for a period  of at least ten (10) days prior
to the meeting as provided in the manner, and subject to the terms, set forth
in Section 219 of the DGCL (or any successor provision). The list shall also
be open to the examination of any stockholder during the  whole time of the
meeting as provided by law.

 


 

 

SECTION 9. Presiding Officer. The Board of Directors shall designate a 
representative to preside over all Annual Meetings or special meetings of
stockholders, provided that if the Board of Directors does not so designate
such a presiding officer, then the Chairman of the Board, if one is elected,
shall preside  over such meetings. If the Board of Directors does not so
designate such a presiding officer and there is no Chairman of the Board or
the Chairman of the Board is unable to so preside or is absent, then the Chief
Executive Officer, if one is  elected, shall preside over such meetings,
provided further that if there is no Chief Executive Officer or the Chief
Executive Officer is unable to so preside or is absent, then the President
shall preside over such meetings. The presiding  officer at any Annual
Meeting or special meeting of stockholders shall have the power, among other
things, to adjourn such meeting at any time and from time to time, subject to
Sections 4 and 5 of this Article I. The order of business and all  other
matters of procedure at any meeting of the stockholders shall be determined by
the presiding officer.

 


 

 

SECTION 10. Inspectors of Elections. The Corporation shall, in advance of
any  meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one
or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to
act. If no  inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of
stockholders, the presiding officer shall appoint one or more inspectors to
act at the meeting. Any inspector may, but need not, be an officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation. Each  inspector, before entering upon the
discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall  perform such duties as are
required by the DGCL, including the counting of all votes and ballots. The
inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the
inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors. The  presiding
officer may review all determinations made by the inspectors, and in so doing
the presiding officer shall be entitled to exercise his or her sole judgment
and discretion and he or she shall not be bound by any determinations made
by  the inspectors. All determinations by the inspectors and, if applicable,
the presiding officer, shall be subject to further review by any court of
competent jurisdiction.

waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting
for the express  purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because such meeting is not lawfully called or

at  any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if
all members of the Board of Directors consent thereto in writing or by
electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission
or transmissions are  filed with the records of the meetings of the Board of
Directors. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in
paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in
electronic form. Such consent  shall be treated as a resolution of the Board
of Directors for all purposes.

 


 

 

SECTION 13. Manner of Participation. Directors may participate in meetings
of  the Board of Directors by means of conference telephone or other
communications equipment by means of which all directors participating in the

representative to preside over all meetings of the Board of Directors,
provided that if the Board of Directors does not so designate such a presiding

Governance  Committee and an Audit Committee, and may delegate thereto some
or all of its powers except those which by law, by the Certificate or by these
By-laws may not be delegated. Except as the Board of Directors may otherwise
determine, any such  committee may make rules for the conduct of its
business, but unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors or in such
rules, its business shall be conducted so far as possible in the same manner
as is provided by these By-laws for the  Board of Directors. All members of
such committees shall hold such offices at the pleasure of the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors may abolish any such committee at any time.
Any committee to which the Board of Directors delegates  any of its powers or
duties shall keep records of its meetings and shall report its action to the

registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed on such
certificate shall have  ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the
Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer

issued when the Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class or
series of stock shall contain such legend with respect thereto as  is
required by law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in these
By-laws, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may provide by resolution
or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes  or series of its stock
shall be uncertificated shares (except that the foregoing shall not apply to
shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to
the Corporation), and by the approval and adoption of these  By-laws the
Board of Directors has determined that all classes or series of the
Corporation's stock may be uncertificated, whether upon original issuance, re-
issuance, or subsequent transfer.

 


 

 

SECTION 2. Transfers. Subject to any restrictions on transfer and unless 
otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, shares of stock that are
represented by a certificate may be transferred on the books of the
Corporation by the surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the
certificate theretofore  properly endorsed or accompanied by a written
assignment or power of attorney properly executed, with transfer stamps (if
necessary) affixed, and with such proof of the authenticity of signature as
the Corporation or its transfer agent may  reasonably require. Shares of
stock that are not represented by a certificate may be transferred on the
books of the Corporation by submitting to the Corporation or its transfer
agent such evidence of transfer and following such other  procedures as the
Corporation or its transfer agent may require.

 


 

 


 

 

 

14  


 

 

SECTION 3. Record Holders. Except as may otherwise be required by law, by
the  Certificate or by these By-laws, the Corporation shall be entitled to
treat the record holder of stock as shown on its books as the owner of such
stock for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and the right to
vote with respect  thereto, regardless of any transfer, pledge or other

or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in  respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is  adopted by the Board of Directors, and which
record date: (a) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at any meeting of stockholders, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not
be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten  (10) days before the date of such
meeting and (b) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty
(60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to  notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the  meeting is
held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 


 

 

SECTION 5. Replacement of Certificates. In case of the alleged loss, 
destruction or mutilation of a certificate of stock of the Corporation, a
duplicate certificate may be issued in place thereof, upon such terms as the
Board of Directors may prescribe.

Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein by or in the right of the
Corporation, which such Director or Officer is, or is threatened to be made, a
party to or participant in by reason of such Director's or Officer's Corporate
Status,  if such Director or Officer acted in good faith and in a manner such
Director or Officer reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation; provided, however, that no indemnification shall
be made under this  Section 2(a)(2) in respect of any claim, issue or matter
as to which such Director or Officer shall have been finally adjudged by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and
only to the extent that, the Court  of Chancery or another court in which
such Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite
adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such Director or Officer is fairly and reasonably  entitled to
indemnification for such Expenses that such court deems proper.

 


 

 

(3) _Survival of Rights_. The rights of indemnification  provided by this

(4) _Actions by Directors or Officers_. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the
Corporation shall indemnify any Director or Officer seeking indemnification in
connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Director or Officer only if

of the Corporation, unless such Proceeding was brought to enforce such
Officer's or Director's rights to indemnification or, in the case of
Directors, advancement  of Expenses under these By-laws in accordance with
the provisions set forth herein.

 


 

 

 

17  

SECTION 3. Indemnification of Non-Officer Employees. Subject to the
operation  of Section 4 of this Article V of these By-laws, each Non-Officer
Employee may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
DGCL, as the same exists  or may hereafter be amended, against any or all
Expenses and Liabilities that are incurred by such Non-Officer Employee or on
such Non-Officer Employee's behalf in connection with any threatened, pending
or completed Proceeding, or any claim,  issue or matter therein, which such
Non-Officer Employee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or
participant in by reason of such Non-Officer Employee's Corporate Status, if
such Non-Officer Employee acted in good faith and in a manner  such Non-
Officer Employee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had
no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The rights
of  indemnification provided by this Section 3 shall exist as to a Non-
Officer Employee after he or she has ceased to be a Non-Officer Employee and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, personal representatives,
executors and  administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation
may indemnify any Non-Officer Employee seeking indemnification in connection
with a Proceeding initiated by such Non-Officer Employee only if such
Proceeding was authorized in  advance by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

 


 

 

SECTION 4. Determination. Unless ordered by a court, no indemnification
shall  be provided pursuant to this Article V to a Director, to an Officer or
to a Non-Officer Employee unless a determination shall have been made that
such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not  opposed to the best interests of the Corporation
and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, such person had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such determination shall be
made by (a) a majority vote of the  Disinterested Directors, even though less
than a quorum of the Board of Directors, (b) a committee comprised of
Disinterested Directors, such committee having been designated by a majority
vote of the Disinterested Directors (even though less  than a quorum), (c) if
there are no such Disinterested Directors, or if a majority of Disinterested
Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or
(d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

 


 

 

SECTION 5. Advancement of Expenses to Directors Prior to Final Disposition.

 


 

 

(a) The Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of
any  Director in connection with any Proceeding in which such Director is
involved by reason of such Director's Corporate Status within thirty (30) days
after the receipt by the Corporation of a written statement from such Director
requesting such  advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or
after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall
reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Director and shall be
preceded or accompanied by an  undertaking by or on behalf of such Director
to repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that
such Director is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation  shall advance all Expenses
incurred by or on behalf of any Director seeking advancement of expenses
hereunder in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Director only if
such Proceeding (including any parts of such Proceeding not  initiated by
such Director) was (i) authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, or (ii) brought to enforce such Director's rights to
indemnification or advancement of Expenses under these By-laws.

 


 

 

 

18  

(b) If a claim for advancement of Expenses hereunder by a Director is not
paid  in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Corporation of documentation of Expenses and the required undertaking, such
Director may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid  amount of the claim and if successful in whole or in
part, such Director shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of
prosecuting or defending such suit. The failure of the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors or any committee  thereof, independent legal counsel,
or stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of such
advancement of Expenses under this Article V shall not be a defense to an
action brought by a Director for recovery of the unpaid  amount of an
advancement claim and shall not create a presumption that such advancement is
not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director is not entitled to an
advancement of expenses shall be on the Corporation.

 


 

 

(c) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses  pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Director
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

 


 

 

SECTION 6. Advancement of Expenses to Officers and Non-Officer Employees
Prior  to Final Disposition.

 


 

 

(a) The Corporation may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation, advance any or all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of any
Officer or any Non-Officer Employee in connection with any Proceeding in which
such person is involved by reason of his or her Corporate Status as an Officer
or  Non-Officer Employee upon the receipt by the Corporation of a statement
or statements from such Officer or Non-Officer Employee requesting such
advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final
disposition of such  Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall
reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Officer or Non-Officer
Employee and shall be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on
behalf of such person to repay any Expenses so  advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Officer or Non-Officer Employee is not
entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.

 


 

 

(b) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses  pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Officer
or Non-Officer Employee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the  DGCL.

 


 

 

SECTION 7. Contractual Nature of Rights.

 


 

 

(a) The provisions of this Article V shall be deemed to be a contract
between  the Corporation and each Director and Officer entitled to the
benefits hereof at any time while this Article V is in effect, in
consideration of such person's past or current and any future performance of
services for the Corporation. Neither  amendment, repeal or modification of
any provision of this Article V nor the adoption of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article V shall eliminate
or reduce any right conferred by this Article V in  respect of any act or
omission occurring, or any cause of action or claim that accrues or arises or
any state of facts existing, at the time of or before such amendment, repeal,
modification or adoption of an inconsistent provision (even in the  case of a
proceeding based on such a state of facts that is commenced after such time),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement of Expenses granted herein
or arising out of any act or omission shall vest at the time of the act or 
omission in question, regardless of when or if any proceeding with respect to
such act or omission is commenced. The rights to indemnification and to
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article V
shall continue  notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a director
or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the estate,
heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and distributes of such person.

 


 

 

 

19  

(b) If a claim for indemnification (following final disposition of such 
Proceeding) or advancement of Expenses hereunder by a Director or Officer is
not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after receipt by
the Corporation of a written claim for indemnification or advancement of
Expenses, such  Director or Officer may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if
successful in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, such
Director or Officer shall also be  entitled to be paid the expenses of
prosecuting or defending such suit. The failure of the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) to make a determination concerning  the permissibility of such
indemnification under this Article V shall not be a defense to an action
brought by a Director or Officer for recovery of the unpaid amount of an
indemnification claim and shall not create a presumption that such 
indemnification is not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director or
Officer is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses shall be
on the Corporation.

 


 

 

(c) In any suit brought by a Director or Officer to enforce a right to 
indemnification hereunder, it shall be a defense that such Director or Officer
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

 


 

 

SECTION 8. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to 
advancement of Expenses set forth in this Article V shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any Director, Officer, or Non-Officer Employee may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate or these
By-laws,  agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or
otherwise.

 


 

 

SECTION 9. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense,  to protect itself and any Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee
against any liability of any character asserted against or incurred by the
Corporation or any such Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee, or arising
out of any such  person's Corporate Status, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the
DGCL or the provisions of this Article V.

 


 

 

SECTION 10. Other Indemnification. Subject to any other right which any 
Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee may have or hereafter acquire under
any statute, provision of the Certificate or these By-laws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise to the contrary, the
Corporation's  obligation, if any, to indemnify or provide advancement of
Expenses to any person under this Article V as a result of such person
serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee,
officer, employee or agent of another  corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced by
any amount such person may collect as indemnification or advancement of
Expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint  venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or enterprise (the "Primary Indemnitor"). Subject to any
other right which any Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate or  these
By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or
otherwise to the contrary, any indemnification or advancement of Expenses
under this Article V owed by the Corporation as a result of a person serving,
at the request  of the Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall only be in excess of, and
shall be secondary to, the  indemnification or advancement of Expenses
available from the applicable Primary Indemnitor(s) and any applicable
insurance policies.

(f) _Foreign Award Recipients_. Notwithstanding any  provision of the Plan to
the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in other countries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate or have employees or other individuals
eligible for Awards, the Administrator, in its sole discretion,  shall have
the power and authority to: (i) determine which Subsidiaries shall be covered
by the Plan; (ii) determine which individuals outside the United States are
eligible to participate in the Plan; (iii) modify the terms and conditions
of  any Award granted to individuals outside the United States to comply with
applicable foreign laws; (iv) establish subplans and modify exercise
procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent the Administrator
determines such actions to  be necessary or advisable (and such subplans
and/or modifications shall be attached to this Plan as appendices); provided,
however, that no such subplans and/or modifications shall increase the share
limitations contained in Section 3(a) hereof;  and (v) take any action,
before or after an Award is made, that the Administrator determines to be
necessary or advisable to obtain approval or comply with any local
governmental regulatory exemptions or  approvals. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrator may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards
shall be granted, that would violate the Exchange Act or any other applicable
United States securities law, the Code, or any other  applicable United
States governing statute or law.

SECTION 3. _STOCK ISSUABLE UNDER THE PLAN; MERGERS; SUBSTITUTION_

 


 

 

(a) _Stock Issuable_. The maximum number of shares of  Stock reserved and
available for issuance under the Plan shall be [10% of post-closing basic
shares outstanding] shares (the " _Initial Limit_ "), subject to adjustment as
provided in this Section 3, plus on January 1, 2021 and each January 1 
thereafter, the number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance
under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by four percent (4%) of the
number of shares of Stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding
December 31 or  such lesser amount as determined by the Board (the " _Annual
Increase_ "). Subject to such overall limitation, the maximum aggregate number
of shares of Stock that may be issued in the form of Incentive Stock Options
shall not exceed the  Initial Limit cumulatively increased on January 1, 2021
and on each January 1 thereafter by the lesser of the Annual Increase for such
year or [10% of post-closing basic shares outstanding] shares of Stock,
subject in all cases to adjustment as  provided in this Section 3. For
purposes of this limitation, the shares of Stock underlying any awards under
the Plan and under the Prior Plans that are forfeited, canceled, held back
upon exercise of an Option or settlement of an Award to cover  the exercise
price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting,
satisfied without the issuance of Stock or otherwise terminated (other than by
exercise) shall be added back to the shares of Stock available for issuance
under  the Plan and, to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the shares of Stock that may be
issued as Incentive Stock Options. The shares available for issuance under the
Plan may be authorized  but unissued shares of Stock or shares of Stock
reacquired by the Company. Awards that may be settled solely in cash shall not
be counted against the share reserve, nor shall they reduce the shares of
Stock authorized for grant to any grantee in  any calendar year.

 


 

 

(b) _Changes in Stock_. Subject to Section 3(c) hereof,  if, as a result of
any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the Company's capital
stock, the outstanding shares of Stock are increased or decreased or are 
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the
Company, or additional shares or new or different shares or other securities
of the Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with respect to such
shares of  Stock or other securities, or, if, as a result of any merger or
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company,
the outstanding shares of Stock are converted into or exchanged for securities
of the Company or any  successor entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof),
the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall make an appropriate or
proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number of shares reserved for
issuance under the Plan, including the maximum  number of shares that may be
issued in the form of Incentive Stock Options, (ii) the number and kind of
shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding Awards under the
Plan, (iii) the repurchase price, if any, per share subject to  each
outstanding Restricted Stock Award, and (iv) the exercise price for each share
subject to any then outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
under the Plan, without changing the aggregate exercise price (i.e., the
exercise  price multiplied by the number of shares subject to Stock Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights) as to which such Stock Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights remain exercisable. The Administrator may also make
equitable or proportionate  adjustments in the number of shares subject to
outstanding Awards and the exercise price and the terms of outstanding Awards
to take into consideration cash dividends paid other than in the ordinary
course or any other extraordinary corporate  event. The adjustment by the
Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional shares of
Stock shall be issued under the Plan resulting from any such adjustment, but
the Administrator in its discretion may make a cash payment  in lieu of
fractional shares.

(c) _Mergers and Other Transactions_. In the case of  and subject to the
consummation of a Sale Event, the parties thereto may cause the assumption or
continuation of Awards theretofore granted by the successor entity, or the
substitution of such Awards with new Awards of the successor entity or 
parent thereof, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of
shares and, if appropriate, the per share exercise prices, as such parties
shall agree. To the extent the parties to such Sale Event do not provide for
the assumption,  continuation or substitution of Awards, upon the effective
time of the Sale Event, the Plan and all outstanding Awards granted hereunder
shall terminate. In such case, except as may be otherwise provided in the
relevant Award Certificate, all  Options and Stock Appreciation Rights with
time-based vesting conditions or restrictions that are not vested and/or
exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the Sale Event shall
become fully vested and exercisable as of the  effective time of the Sale
Event, all other Awards with time-based vesting, conditions or restrictions
shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the effective time of the
Sale Event, and all Awards with conditions and restrictions  relating to the
attainment of performance goals may become vested and nonforfeitable in
connection with a Sale Event in the Administrator's discretion or to the
extent specified in the relevant Award Certificate. In the event of such 
termination, the Administrator shall have the option (in its sole discretion)
to effect either of the following alternatives, which may vary among
individual holders and which may vary among Awards held by any individual
holder: (i) make or  provide for a payment, in cash or in kind, to the
grantees holding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, in exchange for the
cancellation thereof, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the
Sale Price multiplied by the number of shares  of Stock subject to
outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (to the extent then
exercisable at prices not in excess of the Sale Price) and (B) the aggregate
exercise price of all such outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights 
(provided that, in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an
exercise price equal to or greater than the Sale Price, such Option or Stock
Appreciation Right shall be cancelled for no consideration); or (ii) permit a
grantee to  exercise all or any portion of such grantee's outstanding Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights (to the extent then exercisable), for a limited
period of time on or before a date prior to the consummation of the Sale Event
as specified by the  Administrator, after which specified date all
unexercised Awards and all rights of holders thereunder shall terminate. The
Administrator shall also have the option (in its sole discretion) to make or
provide for a payment, in cash or in kind, to  the grantees holding Awards
other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, in an amount equal to the
Sale Price multiplied by the number of vested shares of Stock under such
Awards.

(d) _Maximum Awards to Non-Employee Directors_. The  aggregate amount of
compensation, including both Awards granted under this Plan and cash
compensation, paid to any Non-Employee Director in a calendar year period
shall not exceed $750,000; provided, however, that such amount shall be
$1,000,000  for the calendar year in which the applicable Non-Employee
Director is initially appointed to the Board. For the purpose of this
limitation, the amount of any Award paid in a calendar year shall be its grant
date fair value, as determined in  accordance with ASC 718 or successor
provision but excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures related to
service-based vesting provisions.

 


 

 

SECTION 4. _ELIGIBILITY_

 


 

 

Grantees under the Plan will be such employees, Non-Employee Directors or
Consultants of the Company and its Affiliates as are selected from time to 
time by the Administrator in its sole discretion; provided that Awards may not
be granted to employees, Directors or Consultants who are providing services
only to any "parent" of the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 405 of
the Act, unless  (i) the stock underlying the Awards is treated as "service
recipient stock" under Section 409A or (ii) the Company has determined that
such Awards are exempt from or otherwise comply with Section 409A.

 


 

 

SECTION 5. _STOCK OPTIONS_

 


 

 

(a) _Award of Stock Options_. The Administrator may  grant Stock Options
under the Plan. Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form
as the Administrator may from time to time approve.

 


 

 

Stock Options granted under the Plan may be either Incentive Stock Options or
Non-Qualified Stock Options. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only  to
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary that is a "subsidiary corporation"
within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code. To the extent that any
Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall be deemed a
Non-Qualified  Stock Option.

 


 

 

Stock Options granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and 
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator
shall deem desirable. If the Administrator so determines, Stock Options may be
granted in lieu of cash compensation at the optionee's election, subject to
such terms and  conditions as the Administrator may establish.

 


 

 

(b) _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per share for  the Stock covered by
a Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be determined by the
Administrator at the time of grant but shall not be less than 100 percent of
the Fair Market Value on the date of grant. In the case of an  Incentive
Stock Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the exercise price of
such Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 110 percent of the Fair
Market Value on the grant date.

 


 

   

Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.

 

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

 

Page 9 of 18

  
   

(c) _Option Term_. The term of each Stock Option shall  be fixed by the
Administrator, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years
after the date the Stock Option is granted. In the case of an Incentive Stock
Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the term of such Stock  Option
shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.

 


 

 

(d) _Exercisability; Rights of a Stockholder_. Stock  Options shall become
exercisable at such time or times, whether or not in installments, as shall be
determined by the Administrator at or after the grant date. The Administrator
may at any time accelerate the exercisability of all or any portion  of any
Stock Option. An optionee shall have the rights of a stockholder only as to
shares acquired upon the exercise of a Stock Option and not as to unexercised
Stock Options.

 


 

 

(e) _Method of Exercise_. Stock Options may be  exercised in whole or in
part, by giving written or electronic notice of exercise to the Company,
specifying the number of shares to be purchased. Payment of the purchase price
may be made by one or more of the following methods except to the  extent
otherwise provided in the Award Certificate:

 


 

 

(i) In cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument  acceptable to
the Administrator;

 


 

 

(ii) Through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership  following such
procedures as the Company may prescribe) of shares of Stock that are not then
subject to restrictions under any Company plan, with such surrendered shares
to be valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date;

 


 

 

(iii) By the optionee delivering to the Company a properly  executed exercise
notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver
to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company for the
purchase price; provided that in the event the optionee chooses to pay  the
purchase price as so provided, the optionee and the broker shall comply with
such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other
agreements as the Company shall prescribe as a condition of such payment
procedure; or

 


 

 

(iv) To the extent permitted by the Administrator and set  forth in an Award
Certificate, with respect to Stock Options that are not Incentive Stock
Options, by a "net exercise" arrangement pursuant to which the Company will
reduce the number of shares of Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest
whole  number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the
aggregate exercise price.

 


 

   

Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

 

Page 10 of 18

 

 


 

 

Payment instruments will be received subject to collection. The transfer to
the optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the
shares of Stock to  be purchased pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option
will be contingent upon receipt from the optionee (or a purchaser acting in
his stead in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option) by the
Company of the full purchase price for such  shares and the fulfillment of
any other requirements contained in the Award Certificate or applicable
provisions of laws (including the satisfaction of any withholding taxes that
the Company is obligated to withhold with respect to the optionee).   In the
event an optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares
of Stock through the attestation method, the number of shares of Stock
transferred to the optionee upon the exercise of the Stock Option shall be net
of the  number of attested shares. In the event that the Company establishes,
for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the
exercise of Stock Options, such as a system using an internet website or
interactive voice  response, then the paperless exercise of Stock Options may
be permitted through the use of such an automated system.

 


 

 

(f) _Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options_. To the  extent required for
"incentive stock option" treatment under Section 422 of the Code, the
aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the shares
of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted under this 
Plan and any other plan of the Company or its parent and subsidiary
corporations become exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any
calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. To the extent that any Stock Option
exceeds this limit, it  shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option.

 


 

 

SECTION 6. _STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS_

 


 

 

(a) _Award of Stock Appreciation Rights_. The  Administrator may grant Stock
Appreciation Rights under the Plan. A Stock Appreciation Right is an Award
entitling the recipient to receive shares of Stock (or cash, to the extent
explicitly provided for in the applicable Award Certificate)  having a value
equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date
of exercise over the exercise price of the Stock Appreciation Right multiplied
by the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Stock 
Appreciation Right shall have been exercised.

 


 

 

(b) _Exercise Price of Stock Appreciation Rights_. The  exercise price of a
Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market
Value of the Stock on the date of grant.

 


 

 

(c) _Grant and Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights_.   Stock Appreciation
Rights may be granted by the Administrator independently of any Stock Option
granted pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan.

 


 

 

(d) _Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights_.        Stock
Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be
determined on the date of grant by the Administrator. The term of a Stock
Appreciation Right may not exceed ten years. The terms and conditions of each
such  Award shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and
conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees.

SECTION 7. _RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS_

 


 

 

(a) _Nature of Restricted Stock Awards_. The  Administrator may grant
Restricted Stock Awards under the Plan. A Restricted Stock Award is any Award
of Restricted Shares subject to such restrictions and conditions as the
Administrator may determine at the time of grant. Conditions may be  based on
continuing employment (or other Service Relationship) and/or achievement of
pre-established performance goals and objectives.

 


 

 

(b) _Rights as a Stockholder_. Upon the grant of the  Restricted Stock Award
and payment of any applicable purchase price, a grantee shall have the rights
of a stockholder with respect to the voting of the Restricted Shares and
receipt of dividends; provided that any dividends paid by the Company  shall
accrue and shall not be paid to the grantee until the lapse of restrictions on
such Restricted Shares, and such dividends shall expire or be forfeited or
annulled under the same conditions as the Restricted Shares. Unless the
Administrator  shall otherwise determine, (i) uncertificated Restricted
Shares shall be accompanied by a notation on the records of the Company or the
transfer agent to the effect that they are subject to forfeiture until such
Restricted Shares are vested as  provided in Section 7(d) below, and (ii)
certificated Restricted Shares shall remain in the possession of the Company
until such Restricted Shares are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and
the grantee shall be required, as a condition of  the grant, to deliver to
the Company such instruments of transfer as the Administrator may prescribe.

 


 

 

(c) _Restrictions_. Restricted Shares may not be sold,  assigned,
transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of except as
specifically provided herein or in the Restricted Stock Award Certificate.
Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award
Certificate  or, subject to Section 16 below, in writing after the Award is
issued, if a grantee's employment (or other Service Relationship) with the
Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason, any Restricted Shares
that have not vested at the  time of termination shall automatically and
without any requirement of notice to such grantee from or other action by or
on behalf of, the Company be deemed to have been reacquired by the Company at
its original purchase price (if any) from such  grantee or such grantee's
legal representative simultaneously with such termination of employment (or
other Service Relationship), and thereafter shall cease to represent any
ownership of the Company by the grantee or rights of the grantee as a 
stockholder. Following such deemed reacquisition of Restricted Shares that are
represented by physical certificates, a grantee shall surrender such
certificates to the Company upon request without consideration.

 


 

 

(d) _Vesting of Restricted Shares_. The Administrator  at the time of grant
shall specify the date or dates and/or the attainment of pre-established
performance goals, objectives and other conditions on which the non-
transferability of the Restricted Shares and the Company's right of repurchase
or  forfeiture shall lapse. Subsequent to such date or dates and/or the
attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and other
conditions, the shares on which all restrictions have lapsed shall no longer
be Restricted Shares and  shall be deemed "vested."

SECTION 8. _RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS_

 


 

 

(a) _Nature of Restricted Stock Units_. The  Administrator may grant
Restricted Stock Units under the Plan. The vesting conditions or other
restrictions associated with the Restricted Stock Unit may be based on
continuing employment (or other Service Relationship) and/or achievement of 
pre-established performance goals and objectives. The terms and conditions of
each such Award shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and
conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees. Except in the case
of  Restricted Stock Units with a deferred settlement date that complies with
Section 409A, at the end of the vesting period, the Restricted Stock Units, to
the extent vested, shall be settled in the form of shares of Stock (or cash,
to the extent  explicitly provided for in the Award Certificate). Restricted
Stock Units with deferred settlement dates may be subject to Section 409A and
shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator shall
determine in its sole  discretion in order to comply with the requirements of
Section 409A.

 


 

 

(b) _Election to Receive Restricted Stock Units in Lieu of  Compensation_.
The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit a grantee to elect to
receive a portion of future cash compensation otherwise due to such grantee in
the form of an award of Restricted Stock Units. Any such election  shall be
made in writing and shall be delivered to the Company no later than the date
specified by the Administrator and in accordance with Section 409A and such
other rules and procedures established by the Administrator. Any such future
cash  compensation that the grantee elects to defer shall be converted to a
fixed number of Restricted Stock Units based on the Fair Market Value of Stock
on the date the compensation would otherwise have been paid to the grantee if
such payment had  not been deferred as provided herein. The Administrator
shall have the sole right to determine whether and under what circumstances to
permit such elections and to impose such limitations and other terms and
conditions thereon as the  Administrator deems appropriate. Any Restricted
Stock Units that are elected to be received in lieu of cash compensation shall
be fully vested, unless otherwise provided in the Award Certificate.

 


 

 

(c) _Rights as a Stockholder_. A grantee shall have the  rights as a
stockholder only as to shares of Stock acquired by the grantee upon settlement
of Restricted Stock Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the grantee may be
credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the stock  units
underlying his Restricted Stock Units, subject to the provisions of Section 11
and such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine.

 


 

 

(d) _Termination_. Except as may otherwise be provided  by the Administrator
either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 16 below, in writing
after the Award is issued, a grantee's right in all Restricted Stock Units
that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's 
termination of employment (or cessation of Service Relationship) with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.

SECTION 9. _UNRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS_

 


 

 

_Grant or Sale of Unrestricted Stock_. The Administrator may grant (or sell at
par value or such higher purchase price determined by the  Administrator) an
Unrestricted Stock Award under the Plan. An Unrestricted Stock Award is an
Award pursuant to which the grantee may receive shares of Stock free of any
restrictions under the Plan. Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted in 
respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of cash
compensation due to such grantee.

 


 

 

SECTION 10. _CASH-BASED AWARDS_

 


 

 

_Grant of Cash-Based Awards_. The Administrator may grant Cash-Based Awards
under the Plan. A Cash-Based Award is an Award that entitles the  grantee to
a payment in cash upon the attainment of specified performance goals. The
Administrator shall determine the maximum duration of the Cash-Based Award,
the amount of cash to which the Cash-Based Award pertains, the conditions upon
which  the Cash-Based Award shall become vested or payable, and such other
provisions as the Administrator shall determine. Each Cash-Based Award shall
specify a cash-denominated payment amount, formula or payment ranges as
determined by the  Administrator. Payment, if any, with respect to a Cash-
Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award and may be
made in cash.

 


 

 

SECTION 11. _DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS_

 


 

 

(a) _Dividend Equivalent Rights_. The Administrator may  grant Dividend
Equivalent Rights under the Plan. A Dividend Equivalent Right is an Award
entitling the grantee to receive credits based on cash dividends that would
have been paid on the shares of Stock specified in the Dividend Equivalent
Right  (or other Award to which it relates) if such shares had been issued to
the grantee. A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any
grantee as a component of an award of Restricted Stock Units or as a
freestanding award. In no event  shall any Dividend Equivalent Right be
granted to an optionee as a component of a Stock Option. The terms and
conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the Award
Certificate. Dividend equivalents credited to the holder of a  Dividend
Equivalent Right may be paid currently or may be deemed to be reinvested in
additional shares of Stock, which may thereafter accrue additional
equivalents. Any such reinvestment shall be at Fair Market Value on the date
of reinvestment  or such other price as may then apply under a dividend
reinvestment plan sponsored by the Company, if any. Dividend Equivalent Rights
may be settled in cash or shares of Stock or a combination thereof, in a
single installment or installments. A  Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a
component of an Award of Restricted Stock Units shall provide that such
Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled only upon settlement or payment of,
or lapse of restrictions on, such other Award, and that  such Dividend
Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same
conditions as such other Award.

 


 

 

(b) _Termination_. Except as may otherwise be provided  by the Administrator
either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 16 below, in writing
after the Award is issued, a grantee's rights in all Dividend Equivalent
Rights shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of 
employment (or cessation of Service Relationship) with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any reason.

SECTION 12. _TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS_

 


 

 

(a) _Transferability_. Except as provided in Section  12(b) below, during a
grantee's lifetime, his or her Awards shall be exercisable only by the
grantee, or by the grantee's legal representative or guardian in the event of
the grantee's incapacity. No Awards shall be sold, assigned, transferred  or
otherwise encumbered or disposed of by a grantee other than by will or by the
laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order. No
Awards shall be subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution, or
levy of  any kind, and any purported transfer in violation hereof shall be
null and void.

 


 

 

(b) _Administrator Action_. Notwithstanding Section  12(a), the
Administrator, in its discretion, may provide either in the Award Certificate
regarding a given Award or by subsequent written approval that the grantee
(who is an employee or director) may transfer his or her Non-Qualified Stock 
Options to his or her immediate family members, to trusts for the benefit of
such family members, or to partnerships in which such family members are the
only partners, provided that the transferee agrees in writing with the Company
to be bound  by all of the terms and conditions of this Plan and the
applicable Award. In no event may an Award be transferred by a grantee for
value.

 


 

 

(c) _Family Member_. For purposes of Section 12(b),  "family member" shall
mean a grantee's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent,
grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law,
father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-
law,  including adoptive relationships, any person sharing the grantee's
household (other than a tenant of the grantee), a trust in which these persons
(or the grantee) have more than 50 percent of the beneficial interest, a
foundation in which these  persons (or the grantee) control the management of
assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the grantee) own more
than 50 percent of the voting interests.

 


 

 

(d) _Designation of Beneficiary_. To the extent  permitted by the Company,
each grantee to whom an Award has been made under the Plan may designate a
beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any Award or receive any payment
under any Award payable on or after the grantee's death. Any such 
designation shall be on a form provided for that purpose by the Administrator
and shall not be effective until received by the Administrator. If no
beneficiary has been designated by a deceased grantee, or if the designated
beneficiaries have  predeceased the grantee, the beneficiary shall be the
grantee's estate.

SECTION 13. _TAX WITHHOLDING_

 


 

 

(a) _Payment by Grantee_. Each grantee shall, no later  than the date as of
which the value of an Award or of any Stock or other amounts received
thereunder first becomes includable in the gross income of the grantee for
Federal or non-U.S. income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make
arrangements  satisfactory to the Administrator regarding payment of, any
Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by
the Company with respect to such income. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, to the extent permitted by  law, have the right to deduct any such
taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the grantee. The Company's
obligation to deliver evidence of book entry (or stock certificates) to any
grantee is subject to and conditioned on tax  withholding obligations being
satisfied by the grantee.

 


 

 

(b) _Payment in Stock_. The Administrator may require  the Company's tax
withholding obligation to be satisfied, in whole or in part, by the Company
withholding from shares of Stock to be issued pursuant to any Award a number
of shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the 
withholding is effected) that would satisfy the withholding amount due;
provided, however, that the amount withheld does not exceed the maximum
statutory tax rate or such lesser amount as is necessary to avoid liability
accounting treatment. For  purposes of share withholding, the Fair Market
Value of withheld shares shall be determined in the same manner as the value
of Stock includible in income of the grantees. The Administrator may also
require the Company's tax withholding  obligation to be satisfied, in whole
or in part, by an arrangement whereby a certain number of shares of Stock
issued pursuant to any Award are immediately sold and proceeds from such sale
are remitted to the Company in an amount that would  satisfy the withholding
amount due.

 


 

 

SECTION 14. _SECTION 409A AWARDS_

 


 

 

Awards are intended to be exempt from Section 409A to the greatest extent
possible and to otherwise comply with Section 409A. The Plan and all Awards 
shall be interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that any
Award is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within
the meaning of Section 409A (a " _409A Award_ "), the Award shall be subject
to such  additional rules and requirements as specified by the Administrator
from time to time in order to comply with Section 409A. In this regard, if any
amount under a 409A Award is payable upon a "separation from service" (within
the meaning of Section  409A) to a grantee who is then considered a
"specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), then no such
payment shall be made prior to the date that is the earlier of (i) six months
and one day after the grantee's separation from  service, or (ii) the
grantee's death, but only to the extent such delay is necessary to prevent
such payment from being subject to interest, penalties and/or additional tax
imposed pursuant to Section 409A. Further, the settlement of any 409A  Award
may not be accelerated except to the extent permitted by Section 409A.

SECTION 15. _TERMINATION OF SERVICE RELATIONSHIP, TRANSFER, LEAVE OF ABSENCE,
ETC._

 


 

 

(a) _Termination of Service Relationship_. If the  grantee's Service
Relationship is with an Affiliate and such Affiliate ceases to be an
Affiliate, the grantee shall be deemed to have terminated his or her Service
Relationship for purposes of the Plan.

 


 

 

(b) For purposes of the Plan, the following events shall not  be deemed a
termination of a Service Relationship:

 


 

 

(i) a transfer to the employment of the Company from an  Affiliate or from
the Company to an Affiliate, or from one Affiliate to another;

 


 

 

(ii) an approved leave of absence for military service or  sickness, or for
any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to re-
employment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the
policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the
Administrator  otherwise so provides in writing;

 


 

 

(iii) an employee becoming a Consultant or a Non-Employee  Director upon the
termination of such employee's employment, unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator, in its sole discretion; or

 


 

 

(iv) a Consultant or a Non-Employee Director becoming an  employee.

 


 

 

SECTION 16. _AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION_

 


 

 

The Board may, at any time, amend or discontinue the Plan and the
Administrator may, at any time, amend or cancel any outstanding Award for the
purpose  of satisfying changes in law or for any other lawful purpose, but no
such action shall materially and adversely affect rights under any outstanding
Award without the holder's consent. The Administrator is specifically
authorized to exercise its  discretion to reduce the exercise price of
outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or effect the repricing
of such Awards through cancellation and re-grants. To the extent required
under the rules of any securities exchange or  market system on which the
Stock is listed, to the extent determined by the Administrator to be required
by the Code to ensure that Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan are
qualified under Section 422 of the Code, Plan amendments shall be  subject to
approval by Company stockholders. Nothing in this Section 16 shall limit the
Administrator's authority to take any action permitted pursuant to Section
3(b) or 3(c).

 


 

 

SECTION 17. _STATUS OF PLAN_

 


 

 

With respect to the portion of any Award that has not been exercised and any
payments in cash, Stock or other consideration not received by a grantee,  a
grantee shall have no rights greater than those of a general creditor of the
Company unless the Administrator shall otherwise expressly determine in
connection with any Award or Awards. In its sole discretion, the Administrator
may authorize the  creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the
Company's obligations to deliver Stock or make payments with respect to Awards
hereunder, provided that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is
consistent with the foregoing  sentence.

SECTION 18. _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

 


 

 

(a) _No Distribution_. The Administrator may require  each person acquiring
Stock pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in
writing that such person is acquiring the shares without a view to
distribution thereof.

 


 

 

(b) _Issuance of Stock_. To the extent certificated,  stock certificates to
grantees under this Plan shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the
Company or a stock transfer agent of the Company shall have mailed such
certificates in the United States mail, addressed to the grantee, at the 
grantee's last known address on file with the Company. Uncertificated Stock
shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the Company or a Stock
transfer agent of the Company shall have given to the grantee by electronic
mail (with proof of  receipt) or by United States mail, addressed to the
grantee, at the grantee's last known address on file with the Company, notice
of issuance and recorded the issuance in its records (which may include
electronic "book entry" records).   Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any evidence
of book entry or certificates evidencing shares of Stock pursuant to the
exercise or settlement of any Award, unless and until the  Administrator has
determined, with advice of counsel (to the extent the Administrator deems such
advice necessary or advisable), that the issuance and delivery is in
compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authorities 
and, if applicable, the requirements of any exchange on which the shares of
Stock are listed, quoted or traded. Any Stock issued pursuant to the Plan
shall be subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the
Administrator deems  necessary or advisable to comply with federal, state or
foreign jurisdiction, securities or other laws, rules and quotation system on
which the Stock is listed, quoted or traded. The Administrator may place
legends on any Stock certificate or  notations on any book entry to reference
restrictions applicable to the Stock. In addition to the terms and conditions
provided herein, the Administrator may require that an individual make such
reasonable covenants, agreements, and  representations as the Administrator,
in its discretion, deems necessary or advisable in order to comply with any
such laws, regulations, or requirements. The Administrator shall have the
right to require any individual to comply with any timing  or other
restrictions with respect to the settlement or exercise of any Award,
including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion of
the Administrator.

 


 

 

(c) _Stockholder Rights_. Until Stock is deemed  delivered in accordance with
Section 18(b), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights of a
stockholder will exist with respect to shares of Stock to be issued in
connection with an Award, notwithstanding the exercise of a Stock  Option or
any other action by the grantee with respect to an Award.

 


 

 

(d) _Other Compensation Arrangements; No Employment Rights_.       
Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or
additional compensation arrangements, including trusts, and such arrangements
may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The
adoption of  this Plan and the grant of Awards do not confer upon any
employee any right to continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary.

CEREVEL THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS, INC.

 

2020 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

 


 

 

The purpose of the Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 2020 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _Plan_ ") is to provide eligible employees of  Cerevel
Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (the " _Company_ ") and each Designated Subsidiary
(as defined in Section 11) with opportunities to purchase shares of the
Company's common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ ").
  [1.3% of post-closing basic shares outstanding] shares of Common Stock in
the aggregate have been approved and reserved for this purpose, plus on
January 1, 2021 and each January 1 thereafter until the Plan terminates
pursuant to Section 20, the  number of shares of Common Stock reserved and
available for issuance under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by the
lesser of (i) one percent (1%) of the number of shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding on the immediately preceding  December 31 or (ii) such lesser
number of shares of Common Stock as determined by the Board (as defined in
Section 1); provided that the total number of shares of Common Stock that
become available for issuance under the Plan may not exceed [10x  1.3% of
post-closing basic shares outstanding].

 


 

 

The Plan consists of two components: a Code Section 423 component (the " _423
Component_ ") and a non-Code Section 423 component (the " _Non-423 
Component_ "). It is intended for the 423 Component to constitute an "employee
stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the 423 Component shall
be  interpreted in accordance with that intent. Under the Non-423 Component,
which does not qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning
of Section 423(b) of the Code, options will be granted pursuant to rules,
procedures or  sub-plans adopted by the Administrator designed to achieve
similar tax, securities, or other objectives for eligible employees as
provided by the 423 Component. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Non-423 Component will operate and be  administered in the same manner as the
423 Component and will be subject to the same limitations applicable to the
423 Component including, but not limited to, the limitations on purchase set
forth in Section 8 of the Plan.

 


 

 

Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms in this Plan shall have the
meaning ascribed to them in Section 11.

 


 

 

1. _Administration_. The Plan will be administered by  the person or persons (the " _Administrator_ ") appointed by the Company's Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") for such purpose. The Administrator has authority at any time to: (a) adopt, alter and repeal such rules, guidelines and  practices for the administration of the Plan and for its own acts and proceedings as it shall deem advisable; (b) interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan; (c) make all determinations it deems advisable for the administration of the Plan,  including to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws, regulations and procedures for jurisdictions outside the United States; (d) decide all disputes arising in connection with the Plan; and (e) otherwise supervise the administration  of the Plan. All interpretations and decisions of the Administrator shall be binding on all persons, including the Company and the Participants. No member of the Board or individual exercising administrative authority with respect to the Plan  shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any option granted hereunder.

 


 

    Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

 

Page 2 of 10

 


 

 

2. _Offerings_. The Company will make one or more  offerings to eligible employees to purchase Common Stock under the Plan (" _Offerings_ "). The initial Offering will begin and end on such date or dates as determined by the Administrator (the " _Initial Offering_ "). Thereafter, unless  otherwise determined by the Administrator, an Offering will begin on the first business day occurring on or after each November 1 and May 1 and will end on the last business day occurring on or before the following December 31 and June 30,  respectively. The Administrator may, in its discretion, designate a different period for any Offering, provided that no Offering shall exceed 27 months in duration or overlap with any other Offering.

 


 

 

3. _Eligibility_. All individuals who render services  as employees pursuant to employment relationships to the Company or any Designated Subsidiary are eligible to participate in any one or more of the Offerings under the Plan, provided that, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator in  advance of an Offering, as of the first day of the applicable Offering (the " _Offering Date_ ") they are customarily employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for more than 20 hours a week and have completed at least three (3) months  of employment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, individuals who are not contemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for purposes of the Company's or applicable Designated Subsidiary's payroll  system are not considered to be eligible employees of the Company or any Designated Subsidiary and shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan. In the event any such individuals are reclassified as employees of the Company or a Designated  Subsidiary for any purpose, including, without limitation, common law or statutory employees, by any action of any third party, including, without limitation, any government agency, or as a result of any private lawsuit, action or administrative  proceeding, such individuals shall, notwithstanding such reclassification, remain ineligible for participation, except to the extent required by Code Section 423 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  exclusive means for individuals who are not contemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary on the Company's or Designated Subsidiary's payroll system to become eligible to participate in this Plan is through  an amendment to this Plan, duly executed by the Company, which specifically renders such individuals eligible to participate herein.

 


 

 

4. _Participation_.

 


 

 

(a) An eligible employee who is not a Participant in any  prior Offering may
participate in a subsequent Offering by submitting an enrollment form to his
or her appropriate payroll location at least 15 business days before the
Offering Date (or by such other deadline as shall be established by the 
Administrator for the Offering).

 


 

 

(b) The enrollment form will (i) state a whole percentage to  be deducted
from an eligible employee's Compensation (as defined in Section 11) per pay
period, (ii) authorize the purchase of Common Stock in each Offering in
accordance with the terms of the Plan and (iii) specify the exact name or
names in  which shares of Common Stock purchased for such individual are to
be issued pursuant to Section 10. An employee who does not enroll in
accordance with these procedures will be deemed to have waived the right to
participate. Unless a Participant  files a new enrollment form or withdraws
from the Plan, such Participant's deductions and purchases will continue at
the same percentage of Compensation for future Offerings, provided he or she
remains eligible.

 


 

    Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

 

Page 3 of 10

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, participation in the Plan  will neither be
permitted nor be denied contrary to the requirements of the Code.

 


 

 

5. _Employee Contributions_. Each eligible employee may  authorize payroll deductions at a minimum of 1 percent up to a maximum of 15 percent of such employee's Compensation for each pay period. The Company will maintain book accounts showing the amount of payroll deductions made by each Participant  for each Offering. No interest will accrue or be paid on payroll deductions.

 


 

 

6. _Deduction Changes_. Except as may be determined by  the Administrator in advance of an Offering, a Participant may decrease the percentage of Compensation designated to be deducted as payroll deductions during an Offering (but not below 1%) by completing and filing such deduction change forms as  the Administrator may require. Such decrease shall be effective with the next payroll period beginning after the date that the Administrator receives such forms and shall apply to all remaining Compensation paid during the Offering, as well as  to Compensation paid during subsequent Offerings. Except as may be determined by the Administrator in advance of an Offering, the Participant may exercise the right to decrease his or her payroll deductions only once during each Offering.   Additionally, a Participant may increase or decrease his or her payroll deduction with respect to the next Offering (subject to the limitations of Section 5) by filing a new enrollment form at least 15 business days before the next Offering Date  (or by such other deadline as shall be established by the Administrator for the Offering). The Administrator may, in advance of any Offering, establish rules permitting a Participant to increase, decrease or terminate his or her payroll deduction  during an Offering.

 


 

 

7. _Withdrawal_. A Participant may withdraw from  participation in the Plan by delivering a written notice of withdrawal to his or her appropriate payroll location. The Participant's withdrawal will be effective as of the beginning of the next payroll period immediately following the date that  the Administrator receives the Participant's notice. Following a Participant's withdrawal and as soon as administratively feasible, the Company will refund such individual's entire account balance under the Plan to him or her (after payment for  any Common Stock purchased before the effective date of withdrawal). Partial withdrawals are not permitted. Such an employee may not begin participation again during the remainder of the Offering, but, subject to meeting the eligibility  requirements under Section 3 of the Plan, may enroll in a subsequent Offering in accordance with Section 4.

 


 

    Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

 

Page 4 of 10

 


 

 

8. _Grant of Options_. On each Offering Date, the  Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a Participant in the Plan an option (" _Option_ ") to purchase on the last day of such Offering (the " _Exercise Date_ "), at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, the lowest of  (a) a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing such Participant's accumulated payroll deductions on such Exercise Date by the Option Price (as defined herein), (b) a number of shares determined by dividing $25,000 by the Fair  Market Value on the Offering Date or (c) such other lesser maximum number of shares as shall have been established by the Administrator in advance of the Offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Option shall be subject to the  limitations set forth below. Each Participant's Option shall be exercisable only to the extent of such Participant's accumulated payroll deductions on the Exercise Date. The purchase price for each share purchased under each Option (the " _Option       Price_ ") will be 85 percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Offering Date or the Exercise Date, whichever is less.

 


 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant may be granted an Option
hereunder if such Participant, immediately after the Option was granted,
would  be treated as owning stock possessing 5 percent or more of the total
combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any
Parent or Subsidiary (as defined in Section 11). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the  attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in
determining the stock ownership of a Participant, and all stock which the
Participant has a contractual right to purchase shall be treated as stock
owned by the Participant. In  addition, no Participant may be granted an
Option which permits his or her rights to purchase stock under the Plan, and
any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company and its Parents and
Subsidiaries, to accrue at a rate which exceeds  $25,000 of the Fair Market
Value of the Common Stock (determined on the option grant date or dates) for
each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time. The
limitation in the preceding sentence shall be applied taking Options  into
account in the order in which they were granted.

 


 

 

9. _Exercise of Option and Purchase of Shares_. Each  employee who continues to be a Participant in the Plan on the Exercise Date shall be deemed to have exercised his or her Option on such date and shall acquire from the Company such number of whole shares of Common Stock reserved for the purpose  of the Plan as his or her accumulated payroll deductions on such date will purchase at the Option Price, subject to any other limitations contained in the Plan. Any amount remaining in a Participant's account at the end of an Offering solely by  reason of the inability to purchase a fractional share will be carried forward to the next Offering; any other balance remaining in a Participant's account at the end of an Offering will be refunded to the Participant promptly.

 


 

 

10. _Issuance of Certificates_. Certificates  representing shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan may be issued only in the name of the employee, in the name of the employee and another person of legal age as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, or in the name of a broker  authorized by the employee to be his, her or their, nominee for such purpose.

 


 

 

11. _Definitions_.

 


 

 

The term " _Closing Date_ " means the date of the closing of the transactions
contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as  of

expenses, income or gains on the exercise of Company stock options, and

application of this definition to Participants outside the United States.

 


 

 

The term " _Designated Subsidiary_ " means any present or future Subsidiary
(as defined below) that has been designated by the Board to participate  in
the Plan. The Board may so designate any Subsidiary, or revoke any such
designation, at any time and from time to time, either before or after the
Plan is approved by the stockholders, and may further designate such
Subsidiaries or Participants  as participating in the 423 Component or the
Non-423 Component. The Board may also determine which Subsidiaries or eligible
employees may be excluded from participation in the Plan, to the extent
consistent with Section 423 of the Code or as  implemented under the Non-423
Component, and determine which Designated Subsidiary or Subsidiaries will
participate in separate Offerings (to the extent that the Company makes
separate Offerings). For purposes of the 423 Component, only the  Company and
its Subsidiaries may be Designated Subsidiaries; provided, however, that at
any given time, a Subsidiary that is a Designated Subsidiary under the 423
Component will not be a Designated Subsidiary under the Non-423 Component.

 


 

 

The term " _Fair Market Value of the Common Stock_ " on any given date means
the fair market value of the Common Stock determined in good faith by  the
Administrator; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Common Stock is admitted
to quotation on The Nasdaq Global Market or another national securities
exchange, the determination shall be made by reference to the closing price on
such  date. If there is no closing price for such date, the determination
shall be made by reference to the last date preceding such date for which
there is a closing price.

Administrator shortens any Offering then in progress.

    Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

 

Page 6 of 10

 


 

 

The term " _Sale Event_ " means(i) the sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person  or
entity, (ii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation pursuant to which the
holders of the Company's outstanding voting power and outstanding stock
immediately prior to such transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding
voting power and  outstanding stock or other equity interests of the
resulting or successor entity (or its ultimate parent, if applicable)
immediately upon completion of such transaction, (iii) the sale of all of the
Common Stock to an unrelated person, entity or  group thereof acting in
concert, or (iv) any other transaction in which the owners of the Company's
outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own at
least a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company or any 
successor entity immediately upon completion of the transaction other than as
a result of the acquisition of securities directly from the Company.

 


 

 

The term " _Subsidiary_ " means a "subsidiary corporation" with respect to the
Company, as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code.

 


 

 

12. _Rights on Termination or Transfer of Employment_.   If a Participant's employment terminates for any reason before the Exercise Date for any Offering, no payroll deduction will be taken from any pay due and owing to the Participant and the balance in the Participant's account will be paid to such  Participant or, in the case of such Participant's death, to his or her designated beneficiary as if such Participant had withdrawn from the Plan under Section 7. An employee will be deemed to have terminated employment, for this purpose, if the  corporation that employs him or her, having been a Designated Subsidiary, ceases to be a Subsidiary, or if the employee is transferred to any corporation other than the Company or a Designated Subsidiary. Unless otherwise determined by the  Administrator, a Participant whose employment transfers between, or whose employment terminates with an immediate rehire (with no break in service) by, Designated Subsidiaries or a Designated Subsidiary and the Company will not be treated as  having terminated employment for purposes of participating in the Plan or an Offering; provided, however, that if a Participant transfers from an Offering under the 423 Component to an Offering under the Non-423 Component, the exercise of the  Participant's Option will be qualified under the 423 Component only to the extent that such exercise complies with Section 423 of the Code. If a Participant transfers from an Offering under the Non-423 Component to an Offering under the 423  Component, the exercise of the Participant's Option will remain non-qualified under the Non-423 Component. Further, an employee will not be deemed to have terminated employment for this purpose, if the employee is on an approved leave of absence  for military service or sickness or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or  if the Administrator otherwise provides in writing.

 


 

 

13. _Special Rules_. Notwithstanding anything herein to  the contrary, the Administrator may adopt special rules applicable to the employees of a particular Designated Subsidiary, whenever the Administrator determines that such rules are necessary or appropriate for the implementation of the Plan in a  jurisdiction where such Designated Subsidiary has employees; provided that such rules are consistent with the requirements of Section 423(b) of the Code. Any special rules established pursuant to this Section 13 shall, to the extent possible,  result in the employees subject to such rules having substantially the same rights as other Participants in the Plan.

 


 

 

14. _Optionees Not Stockholders_. Neither the granting  of an Option to a Participant nor the deductions from his or her pay shall constitute such Participant a holder of the shares of Common Stock covered by an Option under the Plan until such shares have been purchased by and issued to him or her.

 


 

    Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

 

Page 7 of 10

 


 

 

15. _Rights Not Transferable_. Rights under the Plan  are not transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant.

 


 

 

16. _Application of Funds_. All funds received or held  by the Company under the Plan may be combined with other corporate funds and may be used for any corporate purpose.

 


 

 

17. _Adjustment in Case of Changes Affecting Common Stock_.        In the event of a subdivision of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the payment of a dividend in Common Stock or any other change affecting the Common Stock, the number and class of shares approved for the Plan and the share limitation and  Option Price set forth in Section 8 shall be adjusted by the Administrator in such manner as it deems equitable. In the case of and subject to the consummation of a Sale Event, the Administrator, in its discretion, and on such terms and  conditions as it deems appropriate, is hereby authorized to take any one or more of the following actions whenever the Administrator determines that such action is appropriate in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the benefits or  potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to any right under the Plan or to facilitate such transactions or events:

 


 

 

(a) To provide for either (i) termination of any outstanding  Option in
exchange for an amount of cash, if any, equal to the amount that would have
been obtained upon the exercise of such Option had such Option been currently
exercisable or (ii) the replacement of such outstanding Option with other
options  or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion;

 


 

 

(b) To provide that the outstanding Options under the Plan  shall be assumed
by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof,
or shall be substituted for similar options covering the stock of the
successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with 
appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices;

 


 

 

(c) To make adjustments in the number and type of shares of  Common Stock (or
other securities or property) subject to outstanding Options under the Plan
and/or in the terms and conditions of outstanding Options and Options that may
be granted in the future;

 


 

 

(d) To provide that the Offering with respect to which an  Option relates
will be shortened by setting a New Exercise Date on which such Offering will
end. The New Exercise Date will occur before the date of the Sale Event. The
Administrator will notify each Participant in writing or electronically 
prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant's
Option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the Participant's
Option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior
to such date  the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering as provided in
Section 7 hereof; and

 


 

 

(e) To provide that all outstanding Options shall terminate  without being
exercised and all amounts in the accounts of Participants shall be promptly
refunded.

18. _Amendment of the Plan_. The Board may, at any  time, amend the Plan in any respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following amendments by Board action shall have no effect unless stockholder approval is received within 12 months of such Board action: (a) amendments increasing the number  of shares approved for the 423 Component of the Plan, or (b) amendments making any other change that would require stockholder approval in order for the Plan, as amended, to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423(b) of the  Code.

 


 

 

19. _Insufficient Shares_. If the total number of  shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be purchased on any Exercise Date plus the number of shares purchased under previous Offerings under the Plan exceeds the maximum number of shares issuable under the Plan, the shares then available  shall be apportioned among Participants in proportion to the amount of payroll deductions accumulated on behalf of each Participant that would otherwise be used to purchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date, in as uniform a manner as practicable  and as the Administrator determines to be equitable.

 


 

 

20. _Termination of the Plan_. The Plan may be  terminated at any time by the Board. If the Plan is terminated, the Administrator may elect to terminate all outstanding Offering Periods either immediately or once shares of Common Stock have been purchased on the next Exercise Date (which may,  in the discretion of the Administrator, be accelerated) or permit Offering Periods to expire in accordance with their terms (and subject to any adjustment in accordance with Section 17). If any Offering Period is terminated before its scheduled  expiration, all amounts in the accounts of Participants shall be promptly refunded. The Plan shall automatically terminate on the ten-year anniversary of the Closing Date.

 


 

 

21. _Governmental Regulations_. The Company's  obligation to sell and deliver Common Stock under the Plan is subject to obtaining all governmental approvals required in connection with the authorization, issuance, or sale of such stock.

 


 

 

22. _Governing Law_. This Plan and all Options and  actions taken thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles.

 


 

 

23. _Issuance of Shares_. Shares may be issued upon  exercise of an Option from authorized but unissued Common Stock, from shares held in the treasury of the Company, or from any other proper source.

 


 

 

24. _Tax Withholding_. Participation in the Plan is  subject to any minimum required tax withholding on income of the Participant in connection with the Plan. Each Participant agrees, by entering the Plan, that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to deduct any such taxes from any  payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant, including shares issuable under the Plan.

25. _Notification Upon Sale of Shares under the 423  Component_. Each Participant agrees, by participating in the 423 Component of the Plan, to give the Company (if so requested by the Company) prompt notice of any disposition of shares purchased under the Plan where such disposition occurs  within two years after the date of grant of the Option pursuant to which such shares were purchased or within one year after the date such shares were purchased.

 


 

 

26. _Effective Date and Approval of Shareholders_. The  Plan shall take effect on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date, subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present or by written consent of the stockholders  within 12 months before or after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board.

 


 

 

27. _Entire Plan_. This Plan constitutes the entire  plan with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior plans with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 


 

 

28. _Severability_. If any provision of the Plan shall  for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the Plan shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted.
