THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of January

(the " _Company_ "), Fluidigm Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), Dawid Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Shareholder Representative
Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the " _Stockholder
Representative_ "), solely in its capacity as the representative for the
Stockholders and only for the purposes expressly provided herein and for no
other purpose. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and, solely in its capacity
as and solely to the extent applicable, the Stockholder Representative, shall
be referred to herein from time to time as a " _Party_ " and collectively as
the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings set forth in _Article XI_ below.

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
each approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (as defined below), upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have each
determined (i) that the Merger is fair, advisable and in the best interests
of such corporation and its respective stockholders and (ii) to recommend to
its respective stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, each of the Key Employees has entered into an offer letter (each,
an " _Offer Letter_ ") and certain Key Employees have entered into a Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (each, a " _Non-Competition
Agreement_ ") with Parent, in each case, dated as of the date hereof, to be
effective as of the Closing.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I _ _

_THE MERGER_

 

1.01 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "),
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). (b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by
the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject
to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.02 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and the DGCL,
subject to _Section 6.02_; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the Effective
Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
"The name of the corporation is DVS Sciences, Inc."; and (b) the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety
to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
the DGCL, subject to _Section 6.02_.

1.03 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub
at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each
such initial director and initial officer to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as
in effect from and after the Effective Time.

1.04 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing:

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 1.07_ and _1.08_ , each share of Company Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into a right to receive the Per Share
Preferred Consideration.

 

(b) Subject to _Sections 1.07_ and _1.08_ , each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Company Restricted Stock, Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Common Consideration.

 



2 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock and each share of Company Preferred
Stock, if any, held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company (including shares held in treasury) shall be canceled and
extinguished and no payment shall be made with respect thereto (collectively,
the " _Excluded Shares_ ").

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
and automatically converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) Of the Merger Shares into which shares of Company Stock held by each
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the
Effective Time pursuant to _Section 1.04_ (i) such Stockholders Escrowed
Merger Shares shall be deposited in escrow pursuant to _Section 1.08_, and
(ii) the remainder of such Merger Shares not deposited into escrow pursuant
to the foregoing clause (i) (the " _Initial Merger Shares_ ") shall be
delivered to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with _Section 1.06_, subject to the provisions of _Section
1.04(f)_ below.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued, and no certificates or scrip
for any such fractional shares shall be issued hereunder. In lieu thereof,
each Stockholder which would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent
an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal
to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Final Closing
Date Price.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Aggregate Stock
Consideration, the Fully Diluted Common Number and any number or amount
contained in this Agreement which is based on the price of Parent Common
Stock or Company Stock or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Stock, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend thereon.

1.05 _Effect on Company Restricted Stock, Options and Warrants_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) and the Board of Directors of Parent
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary to provide that effective at
the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock held by a
Continuing Service Provider shall be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically into Parent Common Stock (the " _Assumed Restricted Stock_ ") on
the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (subject to the adjustments in this _Section 1.05_), except that the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject to the Assumed
Restricted

  



3  Stock shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Restricted Stock (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock resulting
therefrom shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common
Stock. Each share of Company Restricted Stock held by a person other than a
Continuing Service Provider shall be accelerated to the extent that such
share is subject to acceleration in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such holder is set forth on _Section
3.14(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, and following such
acceleration, any remaining shares of Company Restricted Stock held by a
person other than a Continuing Service Provider shall be repurchased and
redeemed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of such agreements, and the holders of such Company Restricted Stock
shall not be entitled to consideration under _Section 1.04_.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) and the Board of Directors of Parent
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary to provide that effective at
the Effective Time, each Option, whether vested or unvested, that is held by a
Continuing Service Provider shall be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically into an option (a " _Assumed Option_ ") to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments in this _Section
1.05_), except that:

 

(i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject to the Assumed
Option shall be equal to number of shares of Company Common Stock remaining
subject (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) to the Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock resulting therefrom shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Parent Common Stock; and

(ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under the
Assumed Option shall be equal to (A) the exercise price per share of the
Company Common Stock under the Option, divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. In the case of an Option held by a holder that is a resident of Canada
for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada), the exercise price per share
under the Assumed Option shall not, in any case, be less than the minimum
amount that meets the requirements of paragraph 7(1.4)(c) of the Income Tax
Act (Canada).

(c) Each Option held by a person other than a Continuing Service Provider
shall be accelerated on the date which is one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date to the extent that such Option is subject to acceleration in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
holder is set forth on  _Section 3.14(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, and following such acceleration, any Option held by a person other
than a Continuing Service Provider which is not accelerated shall be
terminated without consideration as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



4 (d) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any Option, whether or not
an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be,
and is intended to be, effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as provided in this _Section 1.05_, after the
Effective Time, each Assumed Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to the related Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that with regard to such Assumed Option, any
references to the Company shall be deemed, as appropriate, to mean Parent).
Parent shall take all action necessary, on or prior to the Effective Time, to
authorize and reserve a number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient for
issuance upon the issuance of Assumed Restricted Stock and the exercise of
Assumed Options as contemplated by this _Section 1.05_. Prior to the
Effective Time, and subject to the review of Parent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company shall take all
action necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by this _Section
1.05_ under the Company Equity Plan and all Company Restricted Stock and
Option agreements, including delivering all notices required thereby.

 

(e) No outstanding Warrants shall be assumed by Parent, and the Company shall
cause each such Warrant to be either (i) exercised by the holder of such
Warrant in full or (ii) to the extent not exercised in full, terminated,
cancelled or automatically converted into shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock as of immediately prior to the Closing, either
pursuant to its terms or pursuant to an agreement with the holder thereof.

1.06 _Exchange of Company Stock; Exchange Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall enter into an Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Exchange
Agent Agreement_ "), substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto.
The Exchange Agent shall effect the exchange of the Initial Aggregate Cash
Consideration payable to Stockholders pursuant to  _Section 1.04_ (less the
Working Capital Escrow Amount and the amount of the Expense Fund) and the
Initial Merger Shares for the shares of Company Stock that are outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and entitled to distribution
pursuant to _Section 1.04_. In connection with such exchange, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to provide each Stockholder with a Letter of
Transmittal, in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and, to the extent that a Stockholder has not already
executed and delivered a Joinder Agreement, in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_ (a " _Joinder Agreement_ ") to Parent, a
Joinder Agreement, to such Stockholder, in each case, as promptly as
practicable after the Closing (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
following the Closing Date); _provided_ , that, the Company may provide to
certain Stockholders the Letter of Transmittal and Joinder Agreement prior to
the Closing Date and any such Stockholder may duly deliver such Letter of
Transmittal and Joinder Agreement to the Exchange Agent on or following the
Closing Date in accordance with  _Section 1.06(c)_ below.

(b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall transfer to the Exchange Agent an amount
of cash and certificate(s) representing shares of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to make the payments contemplated to be made by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this _Section 1.06_ and in respect of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.04(f)_. The Exchange Agent shall
hold such funds and shares of Parent Common Stock and deliver them in
accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and the terms and conditions
of the Exchange Agent Agreement.

 



5 (c) Promptly following the Exchange Agents receipt of a Stockholders duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and Joinder Agreement (if not
previously executed and delivered to Parent), together with such Stockholders
certificate representing shares of Company Stock owned by such Stockholder for
cancellation (the " _Company Stock Certificates_ " and together with the
Letter of Transmittal and, if applicable, the Joinder Agreement, collectively,
the " _Exchange Documents_ "), the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver or
cause to be delivered to such holder (i) a wire transfer in an amount equal
to the amount of the Initial Aggregate Cash Consideration payable to such
Stockholder pursuant to _Section 1.04_, less such Stockholders Pro Rata
Percentage of the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund, to the
account(s) designated by such holder in such holders Letter of Transmittal
and (ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
equal to the Initial Merger Shares payable to such Stockholder pursuant to
_Section 1.04_. In no event shall any holder of Company Stock be entitled to
receive interest on any of the funds to be received in the Merger. All fees
and expenses of the Exchange Agent shall be paid by Parent. Any Company Stock
held by a Stockholder that has delivered a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this  _Section 1.06_ shall
not be transferable on the books of the Company without Parents prior written
consent.

(d) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any shares of Company Stock presented
to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason shall be converted into
the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.04_,
without any interest thereon. Any portion of the funds or shares of Parent
Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation,
upon demand, and any holder of Company Stock that has not previously complied
with this _Section 1.06_ prior to the end of such twelve (12) month period
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its
claim for the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of
such Company Stock.

(e) If any Merger Consideration is to be disbursed to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery
thereof that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment
of any portion of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered, or established
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

 



6 (f) No portion of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares of Company
Stock formerly represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company
Stock Certificate shall have surrendered such Company Stock Certificate and
the Exchange Documents pursuant hereto. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or its agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, as may be
required pursuant to _Section 1.04_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or
its agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the Person who is the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to either (a) deliver a bond in such
amount as it may reasonably direct, or (b) provide an
indemnification agreement in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent or its agent, against any claim that may be made against Parent or its
agent with respect to the Company Stock Certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

1.07 _Expense Fund_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Article I_
, concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall deduct from the Initial
Aggregate Cash Consideration due to the Stockholders an aggregate cash amount
equal to $450,000 and deliver such amount to the Stockholder Representative,
on behalf of the Stockholders (in accordance with each such Stockholders Pro
Rata Percentage), at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) designated by the Stockholder Representative (the "
_Expense Fund_ "), to be used for potential future obligations of the
Stockholders to the Stockholder Representative, including expenses of the
Stockholder Representative arising from the defense or enforcement of claims
pursuant to _Sections 8.02_ and _10.01_. The Stockholders will not receive
any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense
Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Expense Fund shall be retained in
whole or in part by or on behalf of the Stockholder Representative for such
time as the Stockholder Representative shall determine in its sole discretion,
at which time the Stockholder Representative shall promptly distribute to the
Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders their Pro Rata
Percentages of any remaining amounts distributed under this _Section 1.07_.

1.08 _Escrow Accounts_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Article
I_ , on the Closing Date, Parent shall (a) deduct from the Initial Aggregate
Cash Consideration payable to Stockholders (on a pro rata basis in accordance
with each such Stockholders Pro Rata Percentage), and deposit with the
Escrow Agent, the Working Capital Escrow Amount in immediately available funds
into an escrow account (the " _Working Capital Escrow Account_ ") to be
established and maintained by the Escrow Agent, (b) deliver to the Escrow
Agent a certificate (issued in the name of the Escrow Agent or its nominee)
representing fifty percent (50%) of the Escrowed Merger Shares (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") into an escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow
Account_ ") to be established and maintained by the Escrow Agent, and (c)
deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate (issued in the name of the Escrow
Agent (the " _Special Escrow Amount_ ") or its nominee) representing fifty
percent (50%) of the Escrowed Merger Shares (the " _Special Escrow Account_ ")
to be established and maintained by the Escrow Agent,

 



7  in each case, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit E_ attached hereto (with such changes as
may be required by the Escrow Agent and reasonably acceptable to Parent and
the Stockholder Representative), to be entered into on the Closing Date by
Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "). All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid by
Parent.

1.09 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any share
of Company Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Common Stockholder or Company Preferred
Stockholder who did not consent to or vote (by a valid and enforceable proxy
or otherwise) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, which Common
Stockholder or Company Preferred Stockholder complies with all of the
provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of appraisal
rights (such share being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Common Stockholder
or Company Preferred Stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the consideration to which the
holder of such share would be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.04_ but rather
shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such
stockholders appraisal rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically be converted into the
right to receive the consideration referred to in _Section 1.04_, pursuant to
the exchange procedures set forth in _Section 1.06_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of a Stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease.
The Company shall give Parent (a) notice of any demand for payment of the
fair value of any shares of Company Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any
such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the DGCL
and received by the Company relating to any Stockholders appraisal rights
and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands for payment under the DGCL. The Company shall
not (x) voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal
with respect to any Dissenting Shares and/or (y) offer to settle or settle any
demand, in either case, without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting
Shares in excess of the Merger Consideration that otherwise would have been
payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with this Agreement
(valuing the Parent Common Stock at the Final Closing Date Price) or (ii)
incurs, suffers or sustains any Losses in respect of any Dissenting
Shares (excluding payments for such shares) ((i) and (ii) together "
_Dissenting Share Payments_ "), Parent shall be entitled to recover the amount
of such Dissenting Share Payments under the terms of _Article VIII_ hereof.

 

1.10 _Closing Payment Certificate_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate (the "
_Closing Payment Certificate_ "), signed by its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer on behalf of the Company, certifying the Companys
good faith estimate of (a) the Net Working Capital Amount (such estimate, the
" _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "), (b) Closing Date Indebtedness
(such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (c) Unpaid
Company Transaction 

 



8  Expenses (such estimate, " _Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses_
"), and (d) Closing Cash (such estimate, " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), in
each case, with reasonable documentation supporting the calculation of each
of such amounts. If prior to the Closing Date, Parent disputes all or any
portion of the Closing Payment Certificate, the chief financial officers of
the Company and Parent shall promptly meet and seek in good faith to resolve
the dispute(s) and the chief financial officer of the Company shall consider
in good faith the views of the chief financial officer of Parent in deciding
whether, in the Companys reasonable discretion, to make any adjustments to
the amounts to be included as part of a revised Closing Payment Certificate
(which such revised certificate shall be delivered to Parent prior to the
Closing Date and shall be deemed to be the Closing Payment Certificate for
all purposes of this Agreement, including the calculation of the Initial
Aggregate Cash Consideration).

1.11 _Final Calculations; Disputes_.

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to the Stockholder Representative a
consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the close of business
on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date which shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied consistently with the Latest Balance Sheet (the
" _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and a reasonably detailed statement setting
forth Parents calculations of the Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date
Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and Closing Cash (together
with the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Closing Statement_ "). After delivery
of the Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative and its accountants
shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to review
the Group Companies books and records and any work papers (including any work
papers of Parents and the Companys accountants) related to the preparation
of the Closing Statement, subject to such confidentiality restrictions as the
accountants shall reasonably request. The Stockholder Representative and its
accountants may make reasonable inquiries of Parent, the Company and their
respective accountants and employees regarding questions concerning or
disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their review
thereof, and Parent shall use its, and shall cause the Group Companies to use
their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants
and employees to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries.

(b) If the Stockholder Representative has any objections to the
Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a written
notice to Parent (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth the basis for such
objections in reasonable detail, including, (i) to the extent practicable,
each item or amount so objected to by the Stockholder Representative to the
Closing Statement, and (ii) to the extent available, the Stockholder
Representatives calculation of each such objected item or amount. If a
Dispute Notice is not delivered to Parent within thirty (30) days after
Parents delivery of the Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative
shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to, on behalf of the
Stockholders, the Closing Statement and the Closing Statement shall be final,
binding and non-appealable by the Parties. If a Dispute Notice is delivered to
Parent within thirty (30) days after Parents delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any objections set forth in the Dispute Notice, but if they
do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of
the Dispute Notice, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall submit
such dispute to the Deloitte and Touche office of San Jose, California (the

 



9  " _Independent Auditor_ "). If any dispute is submitted to the Independent
Auditor, each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative will furnish to the
Independent Auditor such work papers and other documents and information
relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Auditor may reasonably
request and are available to such Party or its accountants (including
information of the Group Companies) and each of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to present the Independent Auditor material
relating to the determination and to discuss, whether or not in the presence
of any other Party, the determination with the Independent Auditor.

 

(c) The Independent Auditor shall resolve only those matters that remain in
dispute after the thirty (30)-day resolution period. It is the intent of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative that the process set forth in this
_Section 1.11_ and the activities of the Independent Auditor in connection
herewith are not intended to be and, in fact, are not arbitration and
that the Independent Auditor shall act as an auditor and not an arbitrator
and no formal arbitration rules shall be followed (including rules with
respect to procedures and discovery). The Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Auditor to resolve all such disagreements as soon as practicable
but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after submission of the
disputed issues to the Independent Auditor. The resolution of the dispute by
the Independent Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not prohibit
either Parent or the Stockholder Representative from instituting litigation
to enforce any ruling of the Independent Auditor resolving any such disputes.
The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such

Liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim, Action or investigation based in whole or in part
on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or was
an officer, director or employee of a Group Company, and pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior

additional information. If, at any time prior to the consummation of the
Financing, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates,
officers or directors should be discovered by the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement so that such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent.

 

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause the

and drafting sessions; (ii) assisting with the preparation of customary
materials regarding the Group Companies for offering documents, registration
statements, prospectuses, prospectus supplements and similar documents
required in connection with the Financing; (iii) furnishing Parent with
quarterly or annual financial statements for periods ending no earlier than

been reviewed by the Companys auditors in accordance with SAS 100), financial
data, audit reports, auditors consents, auditors comfort letters and other
financial information regarding the Group Companies, in each case of the type
and form required by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
or other applicable Law or regulation to be included in such documents; and
(iv) providing Parent information reasonably requested by Parent which is
necessary to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements of the
type and form required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act (such
information, together with the items set forth in clause (iii) the " _Required

exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $500,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except for claims in
respect of the breach of any Parent Fundamental Representation or fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, no claims for indemnification by any
Stockholder Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_ shall be so
asserted, and no Stockholder Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover

Pro Rata Percentages, and (y) to the extent that the Indemnitee is a
Stockholder Indemnified Party, a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the

an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate value of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount (based on the Final Closing Date Price), with respect to Losses

breaches of Parent Fundamental Representations) arising from indemnification
claims made by Stockholder Indemnified Parties prior to the date that is the

Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), if applicable, in
writing (each, an " _Indemnification Claim Notice_ "), describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such
notice shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under
this _Article VIII_ except to the extent the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced
thereby, it being agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to
the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in _Section 8.01_

by a Parent Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative) does not
object in writing within the 30-day period after receipt of an Indemnification
Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of objection (the "
_Indemnification Claim Objection Notice_ "), describing in reasonable detail
the facts supporting an objection to the applicable indemnification claim,
such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the
Indemnitor (or in the case of any Indemnification Claim Notice given by a
Parent Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative) that the Indemnitee
is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

(c) If an Indemnitor (or in the case of any Indemnification Claim Notice given
by a Parent Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative) objects in

parties and, in the case of an indemnification claim to be recovered from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, shall

 



60  be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Indemnity Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms thereof. If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation within 30 days after the receipt of an
Indemnification Claim Objection, the claim shall be resolved pursuant to
_Section 12.15_.

hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee will promptly notify
the Indemnitor in writing of such Third-Party Claim and of its claims of
indemnification with respect thereto (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ "),
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim or Action; _provided_ , that failure to
promptly give such notice will not relieve the Indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations under this _Article VIII_ , except to the extent,
if any, that the Indemnitor has actually been prejudiced thereby, it being
agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of
any applicable survival period specified in  _Section 8.01_ for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

written confirmation of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee with
respect to Losses resulting from such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article VIII_ (other than  _Section 8.04(f)_ and the
second sentence of _Section 8.09(a)_, which in no event shall limit the
Indemnitors obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such
Losses), have the right to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, at
its sole cost and expense with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnitee by written notice to the Indemnitee within twenty (20)
calendar days after the Indemnitor has received notice of the Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor must conduct the defense
of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to
preserve its rights in this regard; and provided, further, that the
Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim.

(c) The Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee unless the judgment or proposed settlement
(i) includes an unconditional release of all Liability of each Indemnitee
with respect to such Third-Party Claim, (ii) involves only the payment of
money damages that are fully covered by the Indemnitor, and (iii) does not
impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnitee. So long
as the Indemnitor has assumed and is conducting the defense of the Third-Party
Claim in accordance with _Section 8.07(b)_ above, the Indemnitee (x) will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed by the Indemnitor) and (y) will, and will cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel
and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 



61 (d) In the event that the Indemnitor fails to assume the defense of the Third-
Party Claim in accordance with _Section 8.07(b)_ above, (i) the Indemnitee
may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter in to
any settlement with respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnitee need not consult with, or
obtain any consent from, the Indemnitor in connection therewith); _provided_ ,
that the Indemnitor may nonetheless participate in (but not determine or
control) the defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and at
its own expense, (ii) the Indemnitor will remain responsible for any Losses of
the Indemnitee as a result of such Third-Party Claim to the extent subject to
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , and (iii) Parent and the Company
shall retain all remedies to which they are entitled under this Article VIII
(including recovery against the Indemnity Escrow Account or Special Escrow
Account, as applicable).

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, to prosecute, defend and settle any claim (i)
that in the reasonable judgment of the Parent would be reasonably expected to
materially adversely affect the Group Companies, taken as a whole, (ii) that
relates to or involves any then current customer or supplier of Parent or any
Group Company, (iii) involving criminal liability, (iii) relating to the
Intellectual Property of any Person, or (iv) in which equitable relief is
sought against any Indemnitee; _provided_ that if such claim also
seeks monetary relief, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim with respect to such monetary relief
being sought and to employ counsel, at the Stockholders sole cost and
expense, to assist in the handling of such claim with respect to such
monetary relief being sought (collectively, the " _Parent-Handled Claims_ ").
Parent and the Company shall have the right to pursue in good faith, through
counsel of their selection, the prosecution, defense or settlement of all
Parent-Handled Claims until such time, if any, that Parent shall elect not to
pursue indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitor
will remain responsible for any Losses of Parent and the Company as a result
of such Parent-Handled Claims to the extent subject to indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ , and Parent and the Company shall retain all remedies to
which they are entitled under this _Article VIII_  (including recovery
against the Indemnity Escrow Account or Special Escrow Account, as
applicable).

(f) Parent shall, to the extent that Parent and the Company are entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and it could
reasonably be expected that Parent may recover a substantial portion of the
Losses relating to such Parent-Handled Claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_
permit the Stockholder Representative, upon its reasonable request, to
participate in the process of any settlement or other resolution of any
Parent-Handled Claims pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ; _provided_ ,
that Parent shall be entitled to settle, control, compromise or otherwise
dispose of Parent-Handled Claims in its sole discretion and without obtaining
the consent of the Indemnitor.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section 8.07_, the
Stockholder Representative has the full authority to act on behalf of the
Stockholders and Stockholder Indemnified Parties as either Indemnitee or
Indemnitor; _provided_ , that as set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall be
deemed to have given notice to all Stockholders by giving notice to
the Stockholder Representative.

 



62 8.08 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Effective Time, and
except as set forth in _Section 10.01(e)_, the remedies set forth in this
_Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for
any action arising out of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall
limit any remedy any of the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties may have against any Person for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

 

8.09 _Escrow_.

(a) The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall serve as a security for, and a source
of payment of, Parent Indemnified Parties indemnification rights under this
_Article VIII_ (other than Losses under _Section 8.02(j)_), if any, and shall
be disbursed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive source of recourse for
the Parent Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses under _Section 8.02(a)_
(except for any such Losses arising from breaches of Company Fundamental
Representations, or fraud or intentional misrepresentation). Except for any
claims of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, Parent Indemnified Parties
shall first seek recourse against the Indemnity Escrow Account for any and
all Losses for which Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recovery under
this _Article VIII_ (other than Losses under _Section 8.02(j)_) until the
Indemnity Escrow Account has been depleted in full.

(b) The Special Escrow Amount shall serve as a security for, and a source of
payment of, Parent Indemnified Parties indemnification rights under _Section
8.02(j)_, if any, and shall be disbursed in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The Special Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive
source of recourse for the Parent Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses
under _Section 8.02(j)_ (except for any such Losses arising from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation).

 

(c) The procedures for Parent Indemnified Parties to make claims against the
Working Capital Escrow Account, Indemnity Escrow Account and Special Escrow
Account, for the Stockholder Representative to object to such claims, and for
Parent Indemnified Parties to resolve any such objections shall be as set
forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) Fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and (b) fifty percent
(50%) of the Special Escrow Amount, less (i) the aggregate amount, if any, of
any payments made in connection with claims properly made in accordance with
this _Article VIII_ against the Indemnity Escrow Account and Special Escrow
Account, respectively, and (ii) any amounts reasonably determined in good
faith by Parent as necessary to satisfy any claims for which an
Indemnification Claim Notice or Third-Party Claim Notice was properly made in
accordance with this _Article VIII_ , which are not fully resolved and for
which payment has not yet been made (such claims, the " _Outstanding Claims_
") against the Indemnity Escrow Account and Special Escrow Account,
respectively, prior to the Initial Escrow Release Date, shall promptly be
released from the Indemnity Escrow Account and Special Escrow Account,
respectively, and delivered to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement. Any
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount 

 



63  remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, and the Special Escrow Amount
remaining in the Special Escrow Account on the Final Escrow Release Date, less
the aggregate amount, if any, of Outstanding Claims properly made in
accordance with this _Article VIII_ and not fully resolved prior to the Final
Escrow Release Date (such amount of the retained Indemnity Escrow Amount and
Special Escrow Amount, the " _Retained Escrow Amount_ "), shall promptly be
released and delivered to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement. In
the event and to the extent that, after the Final Escrow Release Date, any
Outstanding Claim made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ is finally resolved against such Parent Indemnified Party, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Indemnity Escrow Account or the
Special Escrow Account, as applicable, and deliver to the Exchange Agent for
distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Exchange
Agent Agreement an aggregate amount of the Retained Escrow Amount equal to the
amount of the Outstanding Claim resolved against such Parent Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such distribution shall only be made
to the extent that the Retained Escrow Amount remaining after such
distribution would be sufficient to satisfy the amount of Outstanding Claims
that are still unresolved at such time. For purposes of determining the value
of Escrowed Merger Shares to satisfy indemnification claims made by Parent
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement, each Escrowed Merger Share shall be
deemed to have a value equal to the Final Closing Date Price.

ARTICLE IX __

 

 _TERMINATION_

9.01  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by Parent, if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in _Article III_ shall not be true and correct, or if the Company has
failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing),
such that the conditions to Closing set forth in either  _Section 7.01(a)_
or _Section 7.01(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the Closing Date and the
breach or breaches causing such representations or warranties not to be true
and correct, or the failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as
applicable, are not cured within twenty (20) Business Days after written
notice thereof is delivered to the Company; _provided_ that Parent and/or
Merger Sub is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause
the condition to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section
7.02(b)_ to not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

 

(c) by the Company, if any of the representations or warranties of Parent or

part of Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Closing), such that the conditions
to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(b)_ would
not be satisfied as of the Closing Date and the breach or breaches causing
such representations or warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures
to perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within
twenty (20) Business Days after written notice thereof is delivered to Parent

Agreement so as to cause the condition to Closing set forth in _Section
7.01(a)_ or  _Section 7.01(b)_ from being satisfied as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ further that the failure to deliver the Merger Consideration or the
payments contemplated by _Section 2.02_ at the Closing as required hereunder

the Company;

(d) by Parent or the Company, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or prior to March 14, 2014 (such
date, the " _Outside Date_ ") and the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_ shall not have ( _provided_
that, if such Party is Parent, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have)
breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any
manner that shall have been the principal cause of the failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before the Outside Date;

(e) by Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered, any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction, order or other legal restraint which is
in effect and which has the effect of making the Merger illegal; or

(f) by Parent, if the Stockholder Approval is not obtained within eight (8)
hours after the execution of this Agreement.

either Parent or the Company as provided above, (a) the provisions of this
Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further force and effect

_Section 10.01_, and _Article XI_  and _Article XII_ hereof which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement (other than the provisions of
_Section 12.17_, which shall terminate)), and there shall be no liability on
the part of either Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Stockholder
Representative or the Stockholders to one another, except for willful breaches
of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination and (b) each of Parent
and the Company agree that all Contracts by and between the Parent or its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, shall immediately be terminated and have no further force or
effect as of the effective time of the termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, execute and/or cause to be delivered to the other
Party such instruments and other documents, and shall take such
other actions, as the other Party may reasonably request at any time for the
purpose of carrying out or evidencing the actions contemplated by the
foregoing clause (b).

 



65 ARTICLE X __

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 

10.01 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment_. In addition to the other rights and authority granted to
the Stockholder Representative elsewhere in this Agreement, upon and by
virtue of the adoption of the requisite holders of Company Stock of this
Agreement, each of the Stockholders irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Stockholder Representative (and by execution of this Agreement the
Stockholder Representative hereby accepts such appointment), as its true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of such Stockholder, with
full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of such
Stockholder and to do any and all things and execute any and all documents
which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Exchange
Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including (i) execution of the
documents and certificates pursuant to this Agreement, the Exchange Agent
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; (iii) authorizing payment of amounts due
to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.02_; (iv) receipt of notices and
communications pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; (v)
administration of the provisions of this Agreement, the Exchange Agent
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; (vi) giving or agreeing to, on behalf of
all or any of the Stockholders, any and all consents, waivers, amendments or
modifications deemed by the Stockholder Representative, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to be necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and
the execution or delivery of any documents that may be necessary or
appropriate in connection therewith; (vii) amending this Agreement or any of
the instruments to be delivered to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement; (viii) (A) disputing or refraining from disputing, on behalf of
each Stockholder relative to any amounts to be received by such Stockholder
under this Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
any agreements contemplated hereby or thereby, any claim made by Parent under
this Agreement or other agreements contemplated hereby, (B) negotiating and
compromising, on behalf of each such Stockholder, any dispute that may arise
under, and exercising or refraining from exercising any remedies available
under, this Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby and (C) executing, on
behalf of each such Stockholder, any settlement agreement, release or other
document with respect to such dispute or remedy; and (ix) engaging attorneys,
accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of the Stockholders in connection
with this Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby and paying any fees related
thereto.

(b) _Authorization_. Notwithstanding  _Section 10.01(a)_, in the event that
the Stockholder Representative is of the opinion that it requires further
authorization from the Stockholders on any matters concerning this Agreement,
the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to seek such further
authorization from the Stockholders prior to acting on their behalf. In such
event, each Stockholder shall vote in accordance with such Stockholders Pro
Rata Percentage and the authorization of the Stockholders holding at least a
majority of the Pro Rata Percentage shall be binding on all of the
Stockholders and shall constitute the authorization of the Stockholders. The
appointment of the Stockholder Representative is coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable by any Stockholder in any manner or for any reason. This
authority granted to the Stockholder Representative shall not be affected by
the death, illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability to
act of any principal pursuant to any applicable Law.

(c) _Actions by the Stockholder Representative; Resignation; Vacancies_. The
Stockholder Representative may resign from its position as Stockholder
Representative at any time by written notice delivered to Parent and the
Stockholders. If there is a vacancy at any time in the position of the
Stockholder Representative for any reason, such vacancy shall be filled by
the majority vote in accordance with the method set forth in _Section
10.01(b)_ above.

 



66 (d) _No Liability_. All acts of the Stockholder Representative hereunder shall
be deemed to be acts on behalf of the Stockholders and not of the Stockholder
Representative individually. The Stockholder Representative shall not have any
liability for any amount owed to Parent, including pursuant to _Section
8.02_. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub for any liability of a Stockholder or otherwise, or for
anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement except in the
case of the Stockholder Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the
Stockholders for any liability of a Stockholder or otherwise, or for
any error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good
faith (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice
of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith), or for any
mistake in fact or Law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing
in connection with this Agreement except in the case of the Stockholder
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder
Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel in the event of any
dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability to Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders and shall be fully protected with
respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith in
accordance with the advice of such counsel. The Stockholder Representative
shall not by reason of this Agreement have a fiduciary relationship in respect
of any Stockholder.

(e) _Indemnification; Expenses_. Each Stockholder shall, based on each such
Stockholders Pro Rata Percentage, indemnify and defend the Stockholder
Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any
Loss, damage, cost, Liability or expense (including the fees and expenses of
counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of
the Stockholder Representatives duties under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement, in each case, as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the
Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent
attributable to such fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Stockholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from
(i) the funds in the Expense Fund and (ii) the amounts of the Escrow Amount
at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Stockholders; _provided_ , that while this _Section 10.01(e)_ allows the
Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and the Escrow
Amount, this does not relieve the Stockholders from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Stockholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Stockholders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
indemnities will survive the resignation

 



67  or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled and is hereby granted the right
to set off and deduct any unpaid or non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied
Representative Losses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection
with the performance of its duties hereunder from the Expense Fund and, if
the Expense Fund is not sufficient, from amounts that would otherwise be
actually delivered to the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement. The
Stockholder Representative may also from time to time submit invoices to the
Stockholders covering such Representative Losses and, upon the request of any
Stockholder, shall provide such Stockholder with an accounting of all
Representative Losses paid.

 

(f) A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Stockholder Representative
with respect to the Working Capital Escrow Account, the Indemnity Escrow
Account or the Special Escrow Account shall constitute a decision of all the
Stockholders for whom a portion of the Working Capital Escrow Amount,
Indemnity Escrow Amount or Special Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them
is deposited in the Working Capital Escrow Account, Indemnity Escrow Account
or the Special Escrow Account and shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon
each of such Stockholders with respect to the Working Capital Escrow Account,
Indemnity Escrow Account and the Special Escrow Account, and the Escrow Agent
and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each and every such Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.

 

10.02 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

10.03 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Paying Taxes_. Subject to
_Section 5.01(X)_, the Company shall prepare and timely file or cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns that are required to be filed
(taking into account applicable extensions of time to file) by or with respect
to the Group Companies for any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") that are due on or before the
Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice of the Group Companies, as applicable. Parent shall
prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Group Companies for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and any Straddle Period that are due after the Closing
Date (each a " _Pre-Closing Return_ "). Parent shall prepare or cause to be
prepared such Pre-Closing Returns in a manner consistent with past practice of
any Group Company, as applicable, unless otherwise required by Law, and
shall, subject to its rights of indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_ ,
pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due and owing on such Pre-Closing
Returns. With respect to any Pre-Closing Return that may give rise to
indemnifiable Losses of the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article
VIII_ , Parent shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the Stockholder
Representative for its review and approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date on
which such Tax Return is due to be filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions).

 



68 (b) _Allocation of Tax Liability for Straddle Periods_. For purposes of
allocating responsibility for Taxes between Parent and the Stockholders for
Straddle Periods, Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be determined
as follows (i) in the case of Property Taxes, the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes,
determined as though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close
of business on the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Amendment of Tax Returns; Other Tax Actions_. Except as required by
applicable Law, Parent shall not, and shall not allow any Group Company to,
file, re-file, amend or otherwise modify (in whole or in part) any Tax Return
or file any Tax election for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period
(including those filed pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_) if such action could
increase the Stockholders Liability for Taxes pursuant to _Section 8.02_
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholders
will have no Liability for any Taxes resulting from any election under
Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision of Law) filed with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) _Tax Refunds_. Other than in respect of a Tax loss realized during a
period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date that is carried
back and claimed on a Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, any Tax
refunds that are received by Parent or the Group Companies, and any amounts
credited against Tax to which Parent or the Group Companies become entitled,
that relate to Taxes paid by the Group Companies for Tax periods or portions
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the
Stockholders (to the extent not already included as a Tax asset in the
calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount), and Parent shall pay over, or
cause to be paid over, to the Exchange Agent for disbursement to the
Stockholders the net amount of any such refund or any such credit within ten
(10) days after receipt thereof or entitlement thereto.

(e) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. Except as provided in _Section 1.06(e)_, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes,
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Stockholders.

(f) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Group Companies, and the
Stockholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ and any audit, litigation or other
Action with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
and the making available of employees on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Parent, the Group Companies, and the Stockholder Representative
agree (i) to retain all financial books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Group Companies relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or the 

 



69  Stockholder Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority and (ii) to give the other Party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such financial
books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the Group Companies or
the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other
Party to take possession of such financial books and records.

(g) _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise required by
Law, Parent, Merger Sub, the Stockholders, the Company and their respective
Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this _Section 10.03_ and
_Article VIII_ as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes.

(h) _Tax Contests_. Parent shall have the right to control the contest of any
federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, assessments or administrative or
judicial proceedings affecting the Taxes or Tax attributes of the Group
Companies that could result in a claim under _Article VIII_ (a " _Tax
Proceeding_ "), _provided_ that (i) the Stockholder Representative may
participate in the conduct of such Tax Proceeding at the expense of the
Stockholders and (ii) the settlement or other resolution of such Tax Contest
shall be subject to the written consent of the Stockholder Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative in writing promptly upon
receipt of any notice pertaining to any Tax Proceeding, _provided_ that
the failure to give notice shall not release, waive or otherwise affect any
rights to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Stockholder
Representative is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
notifying party shall include with such notification a true, correct and
complete copy of any written communication so received.

(i) _Coordination_. With respect to any Tax Proceedings, to the extent this
_Section 10.03_ is inconsistent with _Article VIII_ , this _Section 10.03_
shall control.

of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific

provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the

jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

12.15 _Jurisdiction_. Any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the

such Action shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court

of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection

court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action
may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each
Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section
12.03_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed cumulative

89 12.17 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the rights
of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique

any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Party may
have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that prior to
a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, such
non-breaching Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to enforce its rights and
the other Partys obligations hereunder not only by an Action or Actions for

and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).
Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (a)
any defenses in any Action for an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief, including the defense that the other Parties have an
adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity; and (b) any requirement
under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

 

12.18 _Privilege_. The parties acknowledge that each of Latham and Watkins LLP

client confidences between any Stockholders and its Affiliates in the course
of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to such Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies); _provided_ , that all communications involving attorney-client
confidences of the Company in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby regarding the terms of
the Contract set forth on _Schedule 12.18_ (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
not related solely to the negotiation and documentation of this Agreement)
(the " _Excluded Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Company. Accordingly, the Group
Companies shall not have access to any such communications (other than
Excluded Communications), or to the files of LandW or MTL relating to such
engagement (other than with respect to Excluded Communications). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) the
applicable Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group Companies)
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to
such engagement (other than with respect to Excluded Communications), and none
of the Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files
of LandW or MTL in respect of such engagement (other than with respect to
Excluded Communications) constitute property of the client, only the
applicable Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group Companies)
shall hold such property rights and (c) LandW or MTL shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
(other than Excluded Communications) or files to any of the Group Companies
(other than with respect to Excluded Communications) by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between LandW or MTL and any of the Group
Companies or otherwise.
