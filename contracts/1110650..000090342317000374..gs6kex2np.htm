practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)

to mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares are cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive the aggregate Per Share Amalgamation
Consideration for such Shares pursuant to _Section 3.01_ a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall
be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to Book-Entry
Shares) as Parent may specify, subject to the Company's reasonable approval,
and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions
thereto.

  

(c)   _Per Share Amalgamation Consideration Received in
Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in the case of Shares represented by a
Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or (ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the registered holders whose Shares have been cancelled
pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the aggregate Per Share Amalgamation Consideration. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the register of
members of the Company, the aggregate Per Share Amalgamation
Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Shares (or, if such Shares are held in book-entry form, proper evidence
of such transfer) is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

  

(d)   _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. Except as provided in
_Section 3.04(j)_ or _Section 3.04(k)_ (as applicable), no cash payment

holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this

(e)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The aggregate
Per Share Amalgamation Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the register of members
of the Amalgamated Company of Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to Parent or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_, subject to satisfaction of the terms,
conditions and requirements set forth in _Section 3.04(c)_.

  

(f)   _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment
Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the Shareholders twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, and any Shareholder who has not theretofore

Consideration with respect to the Shares held by such Shareholder.

  

(g)   _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Amalgamation
Sub, the Amalgamated Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the
Shareholders after the expiry of the applicable limitation period under
applicable Laws (or immediately prior to the date on which the Payment Fund
would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental
Authority), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent and any Taxes resulting therefrom shall be paid by Parent. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish
the rights of any Shareholder to receive the Per Share Amalgamation
Consideration or any other payment as provided herein and Parent shall
promptly replace or restore any funds deposited with the Paying Agent that
are lost through investment.

  

(i)   _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, each of Parent, the Company, the Amalgamated Company (including
any of its Subsidiaries), and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Laws.
Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  

(j)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of
a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, issue the Per Share Amalgamation Consideration for

contrary in this _Section 3.04(k)_ , promptly after the Effective Time,

thereon.

Company SEC Reports filed or furnished on or after January 1, 2014 and prior
to the date of this Agreement (without giving effect to any amendment to any
such Company SEC Report filed or furnished on or after the date hereof and

jurisdiction where the character of the properties and assets owned, leased,
operated or used by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification
or licensing necessary except where the failure to be so qualified or

Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation by the Company
of the Transactions.

  

Section 4.02   _Memorandum of Association and Bye-laws_. The Company

(a)  The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and, subject to approval and the Company's adoption of

Company Vote, to consummate the Amalgamation. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Amalgamation and the other Transactions have been duly
authorized by the Company Board, and no other corporate action on the part of
the Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Amalgamation and
the other Transactions, in each case, subject only to (A) the approval and
the Company's adoption of the Bye-Laws Amendments, (B) the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Amalgamation by the Requisite
Company Vote and (C) the filing with the Registrar to register the
Amalgamation pursuant to the Bermuda Companies Act. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Amalgamation Sub,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of

the issued Shares, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
constitutional documents of the Company (as amended by the Bye-Laws

(c)  The Company Board has received the written opinion (or
oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of CVCapital Securities, LLC (the "
_Financial Advisor_ "), to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and
based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set
forth in the Financial Advisor's written opinion, the Per Share
Amalgamation Consideration to be received by the Shareholders (other than
Parent, Amalgamated Sub and their respective Subsidiaries and holders of the
Dissenting Shares) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
Shareholders (a copy of which has been provided to the Buyer); _provided_
that it is agreed and understood that such opinion may not be relied on by
Parent or Amalgamated Sub.

  

Section 4.05   _Subsidiaries_. A complete and correct list of the

jurisdiction recognizes such concept of good standing), in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties and assets owned, leased, operated or
used by it or the nature of the business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay consummation of any of the
Transactions by Parent or Amalgamation Sub or otherwise be materially adverse
to the ability of Parent or Amalgamation Sub to perform their obligations
under this Agreement.

  

(b)  Parent has previously furnished to the Company a true,
correct and complete copy of the memorandum and articles of association of
Parent and the memorandum of association and bye-laws of Amalgamation Sub,

delay consummation of any of the Transactions by Parent or Amalgamation Sub
or otherwise be materially adverse to the ability of Parent or Amalgamation
Sub to perform their obligations under this Agreement.

  

Section 5.04   _Sufficient Funds; Equity Financing_.

  

(a)  Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and
complete copy of the executed Equity Commitment Letter pursuant to which each
Guarantor has committed to purchase, or cause the purchase of, for cash,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, equity securities of Parent in
the aggregate amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ ", together
with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment
Letter is also referred to herein as the " _Financing Commitment_".

  

(b)  As of the date hereof, (i) the Financing Commitment is in
full force and effect and are the valid and binding obligations of Parent and
the other parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,

respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitment have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect; _provided_ , that Parent and

by the Equity Financing will be sufficient for Amalgamation Sub and the
Amalgamated Company to pay (1) the aggregate Per Share Amalgamation
Consideration, and (2) any other amounts required to be paid by Parent,
Amalgamation Sub and the Amalgamated Company in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses associated
therewith. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach under the Financing Commitment on the part of Parent or Amalgamation
Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Amalgamation Sub, any other party
thereto or that would otherwise excuse or permit any Guarantor to refuse to
fund its obligations under the Financing Commitment. Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section
8.02_, Parent and Amalgamation Sub have no reason to believe that any of the
conditions in the Financing Commitment will not be satisfied on or prior to
the Closing Date or that the Equity Financing will not be available to Parent
at the Effective Time. The Financing Commitment contains all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the
Equity Financing available to Parent or Amalgamation Sub on the terms and
subject to the conditions therein.

  

(c)  As of the date hereof, there is no side letter or other
agreement to which Parent or Amalgamation Sub or their respective Affiliates
is a party that imposes conditions, affects the availability of or modifies,
amends or expands the conditions to the funding, investing or contribution,
as applicable, of the full amount of the Equity Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. Parent has fully paid

their obligations under this Agreement.

Shares or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through

or other rights to acquire any Shares.

holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to
approve this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including the Amalgamation.

immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to the
Amalgamation and taking into account the Financing and related transaction
costs necessary in order to consummate the Transactions, the Amalgamated
Company and each of its Subsidiaries will not (i) be insolvent (either because

greater than the fair market value of their assets or because the fair
saleable value of their assets is less than the amount required to pay their
probable liability on their existing debts as such debts mature); (ii) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in the business of the Company
as conducted immediately prior to the consummation of the Amalgamation; or
(iii) have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as such
debts become due, taking into account the timing of and amounts of cash to be
received by them and the timing of and amounts of cash to be payable on or in
respect of their respective Indebtedness, in each case after giving effect to
the Transactions.

  

Section 5.12   _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Guarantors have delivered to the Company a
duly executed Guarantee in favor of the Company to guarantee certain
obligations of Parent and Amalgamation Sub under this Agreement. The
Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantors, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,
and no event has occurred, which with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantors under the
Guarantee.

  

Section 5.13   _Certain Arrangements_. As of the date of this
Agreement, other than this Agreement, the Support Agreements and the Equity
Commitment Letter, there is no Contract, whether oral or in written, between
Parent, Amalgamation Sub or any of their Affiliates (excluding the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any member of the
Company's management, directors, officers, employees or Shareholders, on the
other hand, that relate in any way to the Transactions, including any Contract
(a) pursuant to which any Shareholder would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Amalgamation
Consideration in connection with the Transactions, (b) pursuant to which any
Shareholder has agreed to vote to approve this Agreement, the Amalgamation or
any of the Transactions or has agreed to vote against any Competing
Transaction or (c) pursuant to which any person has agreed to provide,
directly or indirectly, equity capital to Parent, Amalgamation Sub or the
Company to finance in whole or in part of the Transactions, including the
Amalgamation.

  

Section 5.14   _Independent Investigation_. Parent and Amalgamation Sub
have conducted their own independent investigation, review and analysis of
the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, which investigation, review and analysis was performed by
Parent, Amalgamation Sub, their respective Affiliates and Representatives.

their respective Representatives have been provided reasonable access to the
personnel, properties, facilities and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement, each of Parent
and Amalgamation Sub acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the

representations or opinions of any of the Company, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives (except for the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _Article IV_).

of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and certain plan and budget
information. Each of Parent and Amalgamation Sub acknowledges that these
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets and the assumptions on
which they are based were prepared for specific purposes and may vary
significantly from each other. Further, each of Parent and Amalgamation Sub
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, that Parent and
Amalgamation Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets), and that neither Parent nor Amalgamation Sub
is relying on any estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets
furnished by the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates and Representatives, and neither Parent nor Amalgamation
Sub shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives not to, hold any such person liable with respect
thereto, other than fraud in connection therewith.

  

Section 5.16   _No Additional Representations or Warranties_. Except
for the representations and warranties expressly contained in this _Article
V_, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Amalgamation Sub or any
other person on behalf of Parent or Amalgamation Sub makes any other express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Amalgamation
Sub or any other matter or with respect to any other information provided to
the Company, and that any such other representations and warranties are
expressly disclaimed.

Company or any of its Representatives which is contained or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and

Governmental Authority with respect to, or any request from any

required by applicable Laws, disseminated to the Shareholders.

  

Section 7.02   _Shareholders ' Meeting_. The Company, acting through
the Company Board (or a committee thereof), shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date on which the Company files and/or cleared with

and the applicable requirements of the NASDAQ necessary to promptly and duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as reasonably practicable
the Shareholders' Meeting; _provided_  that the Company may adjourn such
meeting solely (i) to the extent required by Law, (ii) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Company
reasonably believes necessary in order to approve the Bye-Laws
Amendments and/or to obtain the Requisite Company Vote, (iii) if as of the
time for which the Shareholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set

the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel is necessary under applicable Laws, and for such supplemental or

to the Shareholders' Meeting. The Company, acting through the Company Board
(or a committee thereof), shall, subject to _Section 7.04(c)_ and _Section

Statement the Company Recommendation and, subject to the consent of the
Financial Advisor, the written opinion of the Financial Advisor, and (b) use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote; _provided_
that the Company Board may (1) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, (2) withdraw, modify, qualify or change the Company
Recommendation, in a manner adverse to Parent or Amalgamation Sub, or (3)
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose or announce any intent to
adopt, approve or recommend, any of the foregoing (including any Competing
Transaction) or otherwise take any other action or make any other public
statement in connection with the Shareholders' Meeting inconsistent with
the Company Recommendation (any of the actions described in the foregoing
clauses (1) through (3), a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ "), in
each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of _Section
7.04(c)_ and _Section 7.04(d)_, as applicable, and, following such Change in
the Company Recommendation, may fail to use such reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

Shareholders' Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_.

  

Section 7.03   _Access to Information_.

  

(a)  From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective

cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in their investigation in
connection with the Transactions; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall be required to (1) take or allow actions that
would unreasonably interfere with its operation of the business or (2)
provide access to or furnish any information if doing so would violate any
applicable Laws or where such access to information may involve the waiver of
any privilege so long as the Company or such Company Subsidiary has taken all
reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such information on a
basis that does not compromise its privilege with respect thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, cooperate with Parent in seeking and use reasonable efforts to secure any
consent or waiver or other arrangements to allow disclosure of such
information in accordance with this Agreement and/or the Confidentiality
Agreement in a manner that would not result in such violation or waiver of
privilege.

  

(b)  All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this
_Section 7.03 _shall be kept confidential in accordance with _Section
10.12_.

  

(c)  No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ shall

Section 7.04   _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

  

(a)  Until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, the Company

making, submission or announcement of, or the intent to encourage, facilitate
or assist, an Acquisition Proposal;

  

(iii)  approve, endorse, recommend, execute or enter into any

(iv)  propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives may,
following the receipt of an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this _Section 7.04_:

  

(i)  contact the person or group of persons who has made such
Acquisition Proposal to clarify and understand the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal;

  

(ii)  provide information (including any material non-public
information or data concerning the Company or any of the

of persons so requesting such information an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within thirty-six (36) hours) make available to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company and/or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that is provided to any person or group of persons making such
Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was not
previously made available to Parent or its Representatives; and/or

  

(iii)  engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with the person or group of persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal;

  

 _provided_  that prior to taking any action described in _Section
7.04(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.04(b)(iii)_ above, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, based on the information then available and after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to result in,
a Superior Proposal.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement but subject to compliance by the Company with this  _Section
7.04_, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Company
Board may (A) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation and/or (B)
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, if and only if:

  

(i)  the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise
result from a material breach of this _Section 7.04_, that such proposal
would, if consummated, result in a Superior Proposal and that failure to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

  

(ii)  prior to effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation
or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement in accordance with this _Section 7.04(c)_, (A) the
Company shall have provided prior written notice (the " _Change or
Termination Notice_ ") to Parent that the Company Board has resolved to effect
a Change in the Company Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)_, describing in reasonable detail the reasons
for such Change in the Company Recommendation or termination (which notice
shall specify, if related to an Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms thereof), and (B) the Company shall (1) cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Hong Kong Time on the
day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Change or Termination Notice
(or, if delivered after 5:00 p.m. Hong Kong Time or any day other than a
Business Day, beginning at 5:00 p.m. Hong Kong Time on the next Business Day)
and ending three (3) Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Hong Kong Time (the "
_Notice Period_ ") negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter
and/or the Guarantee so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal or so that the failure to effect a Change in the Company
Recommendation would no longer be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and (2) permit Parent and its Representatives
during the Notice Period to make a presentation to the Company Board
regarding this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and/or the Guarantee
and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent Parent desires to
make such presentation); _provided_ that, with respect to a Change in the
Company Recommendation made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or a
termination of this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and comply again
with the requirements of this _Section 7.04(c)(ii)_ with respect to such new
written notice;

  

(iii)  following the end of the Notice Period (and any renewed
period thereof), the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and/or the Guarantee, that the
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and failure
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; and

  

(iv)  the Company shall have paid, or caused the payment of, the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.06(a)_.

  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement but subject to compliance by the Company with this  _Section
7.04_, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Company
Board may make a Change in the Company Recommendation contemplated by clauses
(1) or (2) of the definition thereof, if and only if (A) an Intervening Event
occurs, (B) as a result thereof the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (C) the Company Board has complied
with the requirements set forth in _Section 7.04(c)(ii)_ as if such
requirements in connection with a Change in the Company Recommendation
relating to a Superior Proposal related to an Intervening Event and (D)
following the end of the Notice Period (and any renewed period thereof), the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), after considering the terms
of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter and/or the Guarantee, that failure to make a Change in the
Company Recommendation contemplated by clauses (1) or (2) of the definition
thereof would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

  

(e)  Nothing contained in this _Section 7.04_ shall be deemed
to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
its Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
Shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer), making a customary "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communications to the Shareholders) or from making any legally
required disclosure to Shareholders with regard to the Transactions or an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, subject to _Section 7.02_ , any public
disclosure (other than any "stop, look and listen" statement) by the Company
or the Company Board thereof relating to any determination or other action by
the Company Board with respect to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Change in the Company Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly

not nor shall it permit the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any agreement

persons against any and all Damages arising out of acts or omissions in such
persons' official capacity as an officer, director or other fiduciary in the
Company or any Company Subsidiary if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_
, that, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), if required by any

_Section 7.05_, to whom this _Section 7.05_ applies, without the consent of
such affect Indemnified Party or person, as the case may be. If Parent or the
Amalgamated Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with, amalgamate with

to have been disclosed by such person pursuant to any of such person's
representations and warranties contained herein, or that relate to such
person's ability to consummate the Transactions; and

  

(c)  any material breach of any representation or warranty or
material failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of such
person set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred;

  

together, in each case, with a copy of any such notice, communication or

7.06_ shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other
provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; _provided_ , _further_
, that failure to give notice pursuant to this _Section 7.06_ shall not
constitute a failure of a condition to the Amalgamation or any other
Transaction set forth in _Article VIII_ except to the extent that the
underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would, standing alone,
constitute such a failure.

  

Section 7.07   _Financing_.

  

(a)  Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Guarantors shall not
(without the prior written consent of the Company) consent or agree to any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision under, the Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment, replacement,
supplement, modification or waiver (i) decreases the aggregate amount of the
Equity Financing to an amount that would be less than an amount that would be
required to consummate the Amalgamation and make the other payments
required by Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Amalgamated Company hereunder or
otherwise contemplated in connection herewith, (ii) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the receipt of the Equity Financing, (iii) would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions, or (iv)
materially and adversely impacts the ability of Parent or Amalgamation Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Equity Commitment
Letter. Upon request, Parent shall furnish to the Company a copy of any
replacement, amendment, modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the
Equity Commitment Letter promptly upon execution thereof. Upon any
replacement, amendment, supplement or modification of the Equity Commitment
Letter made in compliance with this _Section 7.07(a)_ (excluding any
amendment for the sole purpose of joining or adding additional commitment
parties thereto), Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and the
term "Equity Commitment Letter" shall mean the Equity Commitment Letter as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
compliance by Parent with this _Section 7.07_ shall not relieve Parent or
Amalgamation Sub of its obligation to consummate the Transactions whether or
not the Equity Financing is available and each of Parent and Amalgamation Sub
acknowledges that this Agreement, the Amalgamation and the other Transactions
are not contingent on Parent's or Amalgamation Sub's ability to obtain the
financing (or any alternative financing) or any specific term with respect to
such financing.

  

(b)  Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide to Parent and Amalgamation Sub, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide
to Parent and Amalgamation Sub, at Parent's sole cost and expense, all
reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary and
customary in connection with any debt financing (if any) to be obtained by
Parent, Amalgamation Sub or their respective Affiliates in connection with
the Amalgamation (the " _Debt Financing_ "), including using reasonable best
efforts to take the following actions: (i) furnishing Parent and Amalgamation
Sub and their financing sources with the Required Information or other
documents and information reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Debt Financing, including in relation to the Company's or any of
the Company Subsidiaries' current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto, (ii) upon reasonable
notice, participating in a reasonable number of lender presentations in
connection with the Debt Financing at reasonable times and locations mutually
agreed and otherwise reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of
Parent and its financing sources for any portion of the Debt Financing, (iii)

releases and terminations and (iv) providing information regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries reasonably required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing, to the extent requested in writing ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding _Section 7.07(b)_, (x) nothing in this _Section 7.07
_shall require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and (y) none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Debt Financing or be required to take any
action for which it would not be indemnified hereunder, to bear any cost or
expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors (with respect to any Company Subsidiary) or
employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement
with respect to the Debt Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or
that would be effective prior to the Closing and no directors of the Company
shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing.

reimburse the Company following the valid termination of this Agreement for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including (A) reasonable
outside attorneys' fees and (B) fees and expenses of the Company's accounting
firms engaged to assist in connection with the Debt Financing, including
performing additional requested procedures, reviewing any offering documents,
participating in any meetings and providing any comfort letters) to the
extent incurred by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents, investment bankers and other representatives in connection
with the cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries contemplated
by this _Section 7.07_ and (ii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
agents, investment bankers and other representatives from and against any and
all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing and the performance of their respective obligations under
this _Section 7.07_ (including any action taken in accordance with this
_Section 7.07_) and any information utilized in connection therewith,
except in the event such losses arose out of or resulted from (x) the willful
misconduct of such person or (y) misstatements or omissions in written
historical information provided by or on behalf of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection with the Debt Financing.

  

(e)  The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries by Parent and Amalgamation Sub in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that Parent and Amalgamation
Sub shall ensure that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended, or that is not reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company
or the Company's reputation or goodwill.

(the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.02(a)_ shall not be available to any
party whose breach of, or failure to fulfill, any of its obligations under
this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the
failure to consummate by the Termination Date;

  

(b)  any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Injunction
which shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.02(b)_ shall not be
available to any party whose breach of, or failure to fulfill, any of its
obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or primarily
resulted in the enactment, issuance, promulgation, enforcement or entry of an
Injunction by any Governmental Authority; _provided further_ that the party

and such breach or failure is not capable of being cured or has not been cured
within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt by Parent or Amalgamation Sub
of written notice thereof from the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.03(a)_ if the Company is then in material breach of any of

(b)  the Amalgamation shall not have been consummated within

terminated and the Amalgamation and the other Transactions may be
abandoned by Parent, if:

  

(a)  a breach or failure of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred, which breach or failure would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ and such breach or
failure is not capable of being cured or has not been cured within thirty (30)
Business Days of the receipt by Company of written notice thereof from

cause a condition set forth in  _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03_ not to be
satisfied; or

  

(b)  the Company Board shall have effected and not withdrawn a
Change in the Company Recommendation or failed to include the Company

such termination.

  

Section 9.06   _Fees Following Termination_.

  

(a)  The Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent an
amount equal to $11,631,011 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") if this
Agreement is terminated: (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.04(b)_, (ii) by
the Company pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)_; or (iii) by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ without the Requisite Company Vote having been
obtained, or _Section 9.02(c)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.04(a)_
if, at the time of such termination, a bona fide Competing Transaction shall
have been publicly announced or publicly made, disclosed or otherwise become
publicly known or delivered to the Company, and not irrevocably withdrawn
prior to the termination of this Agreement, and within nine (9) months after
such termination the Company or any Company Subsidiary consummates a Competing
Transaction, whether or not it was the same Competing Transaction (
_provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section 9.06(a)_, all references to
"20%" in the definition of "Competing Transaction" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%"). Such payment shall be made, in the case of termination
pursuant to clause (i) above, no later than two (2) Business Days after the
date of such termination, in the case of termination pursuant to clause (ii)
above, at or prior to the time of such termination, and, in the case of
termination pursuant to clause (iii) above, no later than two (2) Business
Days following the consummation of the Competing Transaction mentioned in
clause (iii) above.

  

(b)  Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an
amount equal to $23,262,022 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_ or
_Section 9.03(b)_ , such payment to be made as promptly as possible (but in
any event within two (2) Business Days) following such termination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the Parent Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

  

(c)  In the event that the Company fails to pay the Company
Termination Fee, or Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee, when due
and in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and in order to
obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences an
Action which results in a judgment against the other party for such payment,
such paying party shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable and
documented costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such
other party (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on such unpaid Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, commencing on
the date that the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
the case may be, became due, at a rate equal to prime rate established by the
Wall Street Journal Table of Money Rates on such date plus 1.00%. Such
collection expenses shall not otherwise diminish in any way the
payment obligations hereunder.

  

(d)  Each of the Company, Parent and Amalgamation Sub
acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 9.06_ are an
integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the damages resulting from termination
of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or a
Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 9.06(a)_
or _Section 9.06(b)_ are not a penalty but rather constitute amounts akin to
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section
9.06_, the parties hereto would not have entered into this Agreement.

  

Section 9.07   _Limitations on Liability_.

  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, subject to _Section 10.06_, other than with respect to the
Company's claims for any indemnification under and reimbursement of costs and
expenses pursuant to _Section 7.16_ and, if applicable, _Section 9.06(c)_ ,
the Company's right to receive from Parent the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 9.06(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy

Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the direct or indirect shareholders of the
Company or any other person, or any of their respective Affiliates or

Amalgamation Sub, (ii) the former, current and future holders of any equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest in, controlling persons,

members, managers, general or limited partners, shareholders, assignees of
any of the foregoing (all persons described in clauses (i) to (iv),
collectively, the " _Parent Group_ "), for any loss or damage suffered as a
result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
any failure to perform hereunder or other failure of the Transactions to be
consummated (in each case whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise).

  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
subject to _Section 10.06_, Parent's right to receive from the Company the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.06(a)_ and, if applicable, the
reimbursement of costs and expenses pursuant to _Section 9.06(c)_ , shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) of any member of the Parent Group against the Company Group
for any loss or damage suffered as a result of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, any failure to perform
hereunder or other failure of the Transactions to be consummated (in each
case whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise).

  

(c)  For the avoidance of doubt and subject to _Section 9.07_,
(i) neither Parent nor any member of the Parent Group shall have any
liability for monetary damages of any kind or nature or arising in any
circumstance in connection with this Agreement or any of the Transactions
(including the Equity Commitment Letter) other than (1) the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.06(b)_ and (2) the
reimbursement of costs and expenses pursuant to _Section 7.16_ and, if
applicable, pursuant to _Section 9.06(c)_ , and in no event shall any of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, or any other member of the Company Group
seek, or permit to be sought, on behalf of any member of the Company Group,
any monetary damages from any member of the Parent Group in connection with
this Agreement or any of the Transactions (including the Equity Commitment
Letter), other than (without duplication) from Parent or Amalgamation Sub to
the extent provided in _Section 7.16_, _Section 9.06(b)_ and, if
applicable, pursuant to _Section 9.06(c)_ and (ii) neither the Company nor any
member of the Company Group shall have any liability for monetary damages of
any kind or nature or arising in any circumstance in connection with this
Agreement or any of the Transactions other than (1) the payment of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.06(a)_, and (2) if
applicable, the reimbursement of costs and expenses pursuant to _Section
9.06(c)_ , and in no event shall any of Parent, Amalgamation Sub or any other
member of the Parent Group seek, or permit to be sought, on behalf of any
member of the Parent Group, any monetary damages from any member of the
Company Group in connection with this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
other than (without duplication) from the Company to the extent provided in
_Section 9.06(a)_ and, if applicable, _Section 9.06(c)_.

  

(d)  The provisions of this _Section 9.07_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each member of the Parent
Group and the Company Group, as the applicable

Section 10.03   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

Section 10.04   _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including
the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee, the
Support Agreements, and the documents relating to the Debt Financing (if
applicable) shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall
not be assigned (whether pursuant to an amalgamation, a merger, by operation
of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of each of the other
parties hereto, except that Parent and Amalgamation Sub may assign all or any
of their rights and obligations hereunder to any persons providing the
Financing (including any members of the Lender Group or any provider of
related hedging arrangements) pursuant to the terms thereof (including for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assign as
collateral in respect of such Financing); _provided_ , that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if
such assignee does not perform such obligations.

  

Section 10.05   _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than (a) as provided in _Section 7.05_ and
_Section 9.07_ (which are intended to be for the benefit of the persons
covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons), (b) with respect to
Shareholders and only after the Effective Time, the right of the Shareholders
to receive the relevant Per Share Amalgamation Consideration in accordance
with _Article III_ and (c) regarding members of the Lender Group and Non-
Recourse Parties (as defined in the Guarantee). Each of Parent and
Amalgamation Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
hereby agrees that its representations, warranties and covenants in this
Agreement are for the sole benefit of the other parties hereto. Persons other
than the parties hereto may not rely on the representations and warranties in
this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of
the date hereof or as of any other date.

  

Section 10.06   _Specific Performance_.

  

(a)  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof by the parties, and that money damages or
other legal remedies may not be an adequate remedy for such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Amalgamation Sub,
on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set
forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Amalgamation Sub, on the other hand, shall, subject to _Section 9.07_, 
_Section 10.06(b)_ and _Section 10.06(c)_, each be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof (including the obligation of the parties to
consummate the Amalgamation, subject in each case to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement), including an Injunction or Injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by any party hereto.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
10.06_ or any other provision herein or in any of the other Transaction
Documents to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
Company shall be entitled to obtain an Injunction or Injunctions, or other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief to cause Parent
or Amalgamation Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded at any time
(whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) if (but only
if) (i) all conditions in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction thereof at Closing) have been satisfied or waived,
(ii) Parent and Amalgamation Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.02_ and (iii)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Equity Financing
is funded, it would be ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing.

  

(c)  Each party waives (i) any defenses in any action for
specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If any party brings
any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the Termination Date shall automatically be
extended by (1) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus
twenty (20) days, provided such extended period shall not be more than two
months from the initial Termination Date; or (2) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (A) while the parties hereto may pursue both a grant
of specific performance and the payment of the amounts set forth in _Section
9.06_, neither Parent and Amalgamation Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company,
on the other hand, shall be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance that results in a Closing and payment of such amounts,
and (B) upon the payment of such amounts, the remedy of specific performance
shall not be available against the party making such payment and, if such
party is Parent or Amalgamation Sub, any other member of the Parent Group or,
if such party is the Company, any other member of the Company Group.

  

Section 10.07   _Governing Law; Dispute Resolution_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the Laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent any
provisions of this Agreement which relate to the exercise of a director's or
officer's fiduciary duties, statutory duties, obligations and/or statutory
provisions, or which arise under or are required to be governed by, the laws
of Bermuda (including those applicable to the Amalgamation) shall be governed
by and in accordance with the laws of Bermuda.

  

Section 10.08   _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_.

  

(a)  The parties to this Agreement irrevocably (i) submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of
the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, (ii) agree that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iii) waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding shall not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof shall not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document shall not (as a result of a lack
of personal jurisdiction) be enforced in or by such courts, and (iv) agree
that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such a Delaware state or federal court. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that the exclusive jurisdiction
provided for in this _Section 10.08_ shall not apply to an action to enforce
any judgment obtained in connection with this Agreement, both of which the
parties hereto agree may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The parties to this Agreement agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 10.02_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable
Laws, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

  

(b)  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.08(B)_.

  

Section 10.09   _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of
directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, after the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions
by the Shareholders, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or
change the type of consideration which each Share shall be cancelled in
exchange for a right to receive upon consummation of the Amalgamation or that
otherwise would require further approval of the Shareholders; and that, this
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing duly executed
and delivered by each of the parties hereto.

  

Section 10.10   _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to _Section 10.09_ and to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws, waive compliance with any agreement
of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

  

Section 10.11   _Construction_. References to any document or information
having been "made available" by the Company to Parent and Amalgamation Sub
shall include the Company having made a copy of such document or information
available (electronically or otherwise) prior to the execution hereof.

  

Section 10.12   _Confidentiality_.

  

(a)  Prior to and during the term of this Agreement, Parent and
Amalgamation Sub have disclosed or may disclose to the Company and its
Representatives Confidential Information. Subject to _Section 10.12(b)_,
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent, the Company shall (i) except
as required by applicable Laws, keep confidential and not disclose or reveal
any Confidential Information to any person other than the Company's
Representatives (1) who are actively and directly participating in
the consummation of the Transactions or who otherwise need to know the
Confidential Information for the Transactions and (2) whom the Company will
cause to observe the terms of this _Section 10.12_, and (ii) not to use any
Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with the
Transactions. Each party acknowledges that it shall be responsible for any
breach of the terms of this _Section 10.12_ by it or its Representatives and
the Company agrees, at its sole expense, to take all reasonable measures
(including but not limited to court proceedings) to restrain its
Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the
Confidential Information.

  

(b)  In the event that the Company or any of its Representatives
is required by any applicable Laws to disclose any Confidential Information,
the Company will provide Parent with prompt notice of such request or
requirement in order to enable Parent to seek an appropriate protective order
or other remedy (and if Parent party seeks such an order, the Company will
provide such cooperation as Parent shall reasonably request), to consult with
the Company with respect to Parent's taking steps to resist or narrow the
scope of such request or legal process, or to waive compliance, in whole or in
part, with the terms of this _Section 10.12_. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Parent waives compliance,
in whole or in part, with the terms of this _Section 10.12_, the Company or
its Representative will disclose only that portion of the
Confidential Information that the Company is advised by counsel is legally
required to be disclosed and will use Parent's best efforts to ensure that
all Confidential Information so disclosed will be accorded confidential
treatment.

  

(c)  In respect of the Confidential Information that the
Company may disclose to Parent or Amalgamation Sub in connection with the
Transactions, each of Parent and Amalgamation Sub shall comply with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  

Section 10.13   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission, ".pdf" or other electronic
transmission) in one (1) or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one (1) and
the same agreement.
