NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations and warranties and
mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

PURCHASED EQUITY INTERESTS AND REDEEMED INTERESTS 

1.01. _Purchased Equity Interests and Redemption of Limited Partner
Interests_.

(a) On the terms of this Agreement, at the Closing referred to in Section
1.05, the Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the
Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Sellers, the
Purchased Equity Interests free and clear of all Liens.

(b) On or immediately prior to the Closing, Liberty Propane LP shall deliver
to each holder of Series A Preferred Limited Partner Interests the Redemption
Notice and the Redemption Agreement in substantially the forms attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_. Liberty Propane LP shall use its reasonable efforts to,
simultaneously with Closing, redeem all of the outstanding Series A Preferred
Limited Partner Interests from the holders thereof pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of Section 10.5 of the LP Agreement, in each case in
accordance with applicable federal and state securities Laws (the " _Series A
Preferred Redemption_ ").

(c) Simultaneously with the Closing, Liberty Propane LP shall redeem: (i) all
of the Series A Preferred Limited Partnership Interests from the holders
thereof who have, prior to or at Closing, delivered to Liberty Propane LP an
executed Redemption Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ ; and (ii) all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Limited
Partners Interests from the holders thereof pursuant to and in accordance with
the terms of Section 10.12 of the LP Agreement, in each case in accordance
with applicable federal and state securities Laws (the " _Series B Preferred
Redemption_ " and together with the Series A Preferred Redemption, the "
_Redemption_ ").

1.02. _Purchase Price_.

(a) The purchase price for the Purchased Equity Interests shall be equal to
the sum of (i) $195,000,000 (the " _Base Purchase Price_ ") plus (ii) the
amount of the Working 



 

2  Capital as of the end of the business day immediately preceding the Closing,
_plus_ (iii) Cash on Hand as of immediately prior to the Closing, _less_ (iv)
an amount equal to the outstanding Indebtedness as of immediately prior to
the Closing, and _less_ (v) the Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior
to the Closing (collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to post-
closing adjustment of the components in clauses (ii)-(v) above (collectively,
the " _Price Components_ ") pursuant to Sections 1.03 and 1.04 below (the "
_Purchase Price Adjustment_ "). The day before the Closing, the Representative
in good faith will prepare and deliver to the Buyer an estimate of the
Purchase Price payable at Closing (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "), which
Estimated Purchase Price shall be equal to the sum of (I) the Base Purchase
Price,  _plus_ (II) 95% of the estimated Price Component in clause (ii)
above, _plus_ (III) 100% of the estimated Price Component in clause (iii)
above, _less_ (IV) 100% of the estimated Price Component in clause (iv)
above, and _less_ (V) 100% of the estimated Price Component in clause (v)
above. Additionally, the day before the Closing, the Representative shall
deliver to the Buyer a schedule indicating each Sellers Estimated Pro Rata
Share (the " _Estimated Sellers Allocation Schedule_ "). At the Closing, the
Buyer shall pay to the Representative, for the benefit of the Sellers, an
amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Representative
the day before the Closing.

(b) Simultaneously with the Closing, the Buyer shall loan funds or make a
capital contribution to Liberty Propane LP in an amount sufficient to repay,
or cause to be repaid, the then outstanding balance of Indebtedness (but
specifically excluding the Acquisition Non-Compete Payments and any other
Indebtedness that the parties mutually agree will remain outstanding after the
Closing) by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the
holders of such Indebtedness in instructions provided to Buyer the day before
the Closing (provided, however, that with respect to the Series A Redemption
Price payable to the holders of Series A Preferred Limited Partnership
Interests who have not, prior to or at Closing, delivered to Liberty Propane
LP an executed Redemption Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ , Liberty Propane LP shall fund the Series A Preferred
Redemption Escrow with the necessary funds to complete the Series A Preferred
Redemption). Also, simultaneously with the Closing, the Representative shall:
(i) deliver to the Buyer all applicable payoff letters and shall make
arrangements for lenders under the Indebtedness to deliver UCC-3 termination
statements, mortgage, deed of trust and other Lien releases and similar
documents evidencing the termination of all Liens, held by such lenders; and
(ii) deliver to Liberty Propane LP certificates, if any, evidencing the
Redeemed Interests which are being redeemed.

(c) At the Closing, each of the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer
certificates representing the Purchased Equity Interests consisting of
Sterling GP Blocker Shares and Sterling LP Blocker Shares endorsed for
transfer or accompanied by executed stock powers or equivalent transfer
documents acceptable to Buyer, and, in the case of all other Purchased Equity
Interests, executed assignment instruments in proper form for transfer. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Companies will not be required to
certificate any uncertificated Purchased Equity Interests prior to Closing.



 

3 (d) Simultaneously with the Closing, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to
be paid, on behalf of the Sellers and the Companies (as applicable), the
Transaction Expenses reflected in the calculation of Estimated Purchase Price,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the
Representative the day before the Closing.

(e) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Sterling GP Blocker
Shares, the Sterling LP Blocker Shares, the Other Liberty Propane GP
Interests and the Other Liberty Propane LP Interests in accordance with the
formula set forth on _Schedule 1.02(e)(i)_. The portion of the Purchase Price
so allocated to the Other Liberty Propane GP Interests and the Other Liberty
Propane LP Interests shall be allocated among the assets of Liberty Propane GP
(including its indirect interest in the assets of Liberty Propane LP) and
Liberty Propane LP in accordance with the formula set forth on  _Schedule
1.02(e)(ii)_. The Buyer and each Seller agree to file all federal, state and
other Tax Returns (including Form 8308 and the informational statements
required by Treasury Regulation § 1.751-1(a)(3)) in accordance with
such allocations.

1.03. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. Within 60 days following the Closing
Date (during which time, the Representative shall have reasonable access to
the Companies books and records during normal business hours upon reasonable
prior notice to the Buyer), the Buyer shall deliver to the Representative a
combined balance sheet of the Companies (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and
a calculation of the Purchase Price, including each of the Price Components
(collectively, with the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Purchase Price
Statement_ ") as of immediately prior to the Closing, but in the case of
Working Capital determined as of the end of the business day immediately
preceding the Closing. The Purchase Price Statement shall be prepared and the
Price Components shall be determined using the same accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices and procedures as were used in preparation of
the audited combined balance sheet of the Companies as of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2009 and, except as contemplated by this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, shall not include any changes in assets
or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments from the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties agree that the purpose
of preparing the Purchase Price Statement and determining the Price
Components contemplated by this Section 1.03 is to measure changes in the
Working Capital, and hereby agree that Working Capital shall be determined in
accordance with the Working Capital Guidelines attached hereto as _Exhibit
F_.

(a) During the period immediately following the Representatives receipt of
the Purchase Price Statement, the Representative shall be permitted to review
the Buyers working papers related to the preparation of the Purchase Price
Statement and determination of the Price Components and the Purchase Price.
The Buyer shall cooperate and provide prompt access to the Companies books
and records and relevant personnel (including third party consultants and
accountants), in each case as reasonably requested by the Representative in
connection with the Representatives review of the Purchase Price Statement.
The Purchase Price Statement, Price Components and Purchase Price shall become
final and binding upon the Parties 30 days after the Representatives receipt
of all reasonably necessary supporting documentation related to the Purchase
Price Statement requested by the Representative (but in no event later than 60
days after Representatives receipt of the Purchase Price Statement), unless
the Representative shall give written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") 



 

4  to the Buyer prior to such date. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is
received by the Buyer, then the Purchase Price, the Price Components and the
Purchase Price Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y)
below) shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of (x)
the date the Parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date all
matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm
(defined below). During the 30 days following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Buyer and the Representative shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences which they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

(b) At the end of the second 30-day period referred to above, Grant Thornton,
LLP shall resolve all remaining disputed items, or if Grant Thornton, LLP is
unable or unwilling to act as the accounting firm to resolve the remaining
disputed items, the Buyer and the Representative shall mutually select a
nationally recognized accounting firm (Grant Thornton, LLP or such mutually
selected firm, the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to do so. The Buyer and the
Representative shall submit to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution
of all matters (but only such matters) that remain in dispute. The Buyer and
the Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select one of its
partners experienced in purchase price adjustment disputes to make a final
determination of the Purchase Price calculated with reference to the amounts
that are in dispute. The Buyer and the Representative will cooperate with the
Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. The Buyer and the
Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to not assign a value to any
item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by the
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand, or less
than the smallest value for such item assigned by the Buyer, on the one hand,
or the Representative, on the other hand. The Buyer and the Representative
shall also instruct the Accounting Firm to make its determination
based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the Representative which
are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement (i.e. not on the basis of an independent review). The Accounting
Firm may, at its discretion, conduct a conference concerning the dispute, at
which conference each of the Buyer and the Representative shall have the right
to present additional documents, materials and other information and to have
present its advisors, counsel and accountants. The Purchase Price Statement
and the determination of the Purchase Price shall become final and binding on
the Parties on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in
writing to the Buyer and the Representative (which final resolution shall be
requested by the Buyer and the Representative to be delivered not more than 45
days following submission of such disputed matters), absent manifest clerical
errors or fraud. The final resolution will be a reasoned resolution setting
forth the Accounting Firms reasoning in reaching its determination. In the
case of any dispute arising from this Agreement, discovery of the Accounting
Firm will not be permitted and only the Accounting Firms work papers will be
disclosed to the Buyer and the Representative. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of
the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by such Party. As an example and for illustrative purposes only, if
the Buyer contends the Purchase Price is $95,000,000, the Representative
contends the Purchase Price is $100,000,000 and the 



 

5  Accounting Firm determines that the Purchase Price is $98,000,000, then the
Buyer shall pay 60% of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and the
Sellers shall pay 40% of such fees and expenses.

(c) The Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.03 is
referred to as the " _Final Purchase Price_." Within five (5) days after the
determination of the Final Purchase Price, the Representative shall (i)
deliver to the Buyer a schedule indicating each Sellers Final Pro Rata Share
(the " _Final Sellers Allocation Schedule_ "), (ii) apply the formula set
forth on _Schedule 1.02(e)(i)_ and deliver to the Buyer a schedule with the
resulting final allocation of the Purchase Price among the Sterling GP
Blocker Shares, the Sterling LP Blocker Shares, the Other Liberty Propane GP
Interests and the Other Liberty Propane LP Interests, and (iii) with respect
to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Other Liberty Propane GP
Interests and the Other Liberty Propane LP Interests, apply the formula set
forth on _Schedule 1.02(e)(ii)_ and deliver to the Buyer a schedule with the
resulting final allocation of such portion of the Purchase Price among the
assets of Liberty Propane GP and Liberty Propane LP.

1.04. _The Post-Closing Adjustment Payments_. If the Final Purchase Price is
greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, the Buyer shall, within five (5)
days after the date the Final Purchase Price is determined under and in
accordance with Section 1.03 above, pay to the Representative, on behalf of
the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by the Representative above, the amount of such
difference. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase
Price, the Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall, within five (5)
days after the date the Final Purchase Price is determined under and in
accordance with Section 1.03 above, pay to the Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Buyer, the
amount of such difference.

1.05. _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Greenberg
Traurig, LLP located at 77 W. Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601 at 9:00
a.m., local time, on the date hereof. The date and time of the Closing are
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

1.06. _Post-Closing Series A Preferred Redemption_. In the event that any of
the Series A Preferred Interests have not been redeemed at the Closing ("
_Remaining Series A Preferred Interests_ "), the Buyer shall cause Liberty
Propane LP to deliver to any holder of such Remaining Series A Preferred
Interests (a " _Remaining Holder_ ") its Series A Redemption Price (as set
forth in Section 5.04 of the Disclosure Schedule) upon the delivery by such
Remaining Holder of an executed Redemption Agreement or at any other such time
as may deemed appropriate by the Buyer.

claims relating to or arising from this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Buyer may not avoid the limitations on liability of
the Sellers set forth in this Article VIII by seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentences of this Section 8.02(b), subject to
obtaining recovery pursuant to this Article VIII, effective on the Closing
Date the Buyer hereby waives any and all statutory rights of contribution or
indemnification that it might otherwise be entitled to under any federal,
state or local law, regulation or ordinance or any similar rules of
law embodied in the common law.



 

29 8.03. _Indemnification by the Buyer for the Benefit of the Seller_.

(a) Provided that proper notice has been made within the prescribed survival
period set forth in Section 8.01 above, the Buyer shall indemnify each of the
Sellers and hold them harmless against any Losses which any of the Sellers may
suffer or sustain as a result of: (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Buyer under Article VI, (ii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement by the Buyer under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(1) except to the extent paid by the Sellers out-of-pocket to a third party in
connection with a third party claim, Losses shall not include any
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, including loss of future
revenue or income, diminution of value, loss measured by any multiple or loss
of business reputation or opportunity relating to a breach or alleged
breach of this Agreement and (2) the amount of indemnity payable pursuant to
this Section 8.03 with respect to any Losses shall be reduced (y) to the
extent any such Loss amount has already been taken into account in making any
Purchase Price Adjustment contemplated in Article I and (z) as otherwise
provided in Section 8.04 below.

(b) From and after the Closing, recovery pursuant to this Article VIII
constitutes each Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or
other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Sellers may not avoid the limitations on liability
of the Buyer set forth in this Article VIII by seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentences of this Section 8.03(b), subject to
obtaining recovery pursuant to this Article VIII, effective on the Closing
Date each Seller hereby waives any and all statutory rights of contribution or
indemnification that it might otherwise be entitled to under any federal,
state or local law, regulation or ordinance or any similar rules of law
embodied in the common law.

8.04. _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 shall be calculated net of
any insurance proceeds received or receivable by the Indemnitee on account of
such Loss. The Indemnitee shall seek full recovery under all insurance
policies covering any Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were
not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or
other recovery is received by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for
which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or
Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnitee.

8.05. _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
take all reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any
event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

8.06. _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification of the Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.02 shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by each applicable Indemnitee (as defined
below) within 15 days after the final determination thereof. Any
indemnification of the Sellers pursuant to Section 8.03 shall be effected by
wire 



 

30  transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by each
applicable Indemnitee within 15 days after the final determination thereof.
Each indemnification payment made pursuant to this Article VIII shall, with
respect to the Sellers and the Buyer, be deemed to be an adjustment to the
Final Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

8.07. _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification under Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall
notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing
promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing with
reasonable specificity the claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify
an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that such failure shall have caused the damages for
which the Indemnitor is obligated to be greater than such damages would have
been had the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any
Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an
Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at
its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead
counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_ that the Indemnitee shall
be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel
of its choice for such purpose, but the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor shall control the
defense of any such claim then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such
claim; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent
of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend
such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or
if such settlement does not expressly release the Indemnitee from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice,
except for payments that would be required to be paid by the Buyer
representing the Claims Threshold or Deductible. The Buyer covenants and
agrees that if it brings any claim for indemnification against the Sellers
under this Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(iii)), it shall
tender and pursue its claim only jointly against all of the Sellers (i.e. it
will name all Sellers in any such claim) and, in pursuing such claim, it will
only involve and deal with, the Representative, as the exclusive
representative of all of the Sellers (unless Representative has resigned from
serving as representative of the Sellers under the terms of the Representative
Agreement).

ARTICLE IX.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS 

9.01. _Disclosure Generally_. All exhibits and schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the exhibits or schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire
Agreement, including all exhibits and schedules. Any item or matter required
to be disclosed on a particular section of the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed if information for such
item or matter complying with such disclosure requirements is set forth
on another section of the Disclosure Schedule under this 



 

31  Agreement if such disclosure with respect to such first section is
reasonably apparent. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion
of any specific item in the schedules hereto is not intended to imply that
such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other
items, are or are not required to be disclosed or are within or outside of
the ordinary course of business, and neither Party shall use the fact of the
setting forth of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in
the schedules in any dispute or controversy with any Party as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in a schedule
hereto is or is not required to be disclosed (including, without limitation,
whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material) or in
the ordinary course of business for the purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in the Disclosure Schedule is disclosed solely for the
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained therein shall be
deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third party of any matter
whatsoever, including of any violation of law or breach of any agreement. The
Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separately titled sections corresponding to the sections of the Agreement;
however, each section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedules if such disclosure is reasonably apparent. Capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein
shall have the meanings given to such terms in this Agreement.

9.02. _Acknowledgment by the Buyer_. THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY AND
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES,
CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
SELLERS AND THE COMPANY, RESPECTIVELY, TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THE FUTURE FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF ANY OF THE
COMPANIES) ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY THE SELLERS AND THE COMPANY.

9.03. _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall, consistent with
the past practices of the Companies, prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Companies for all periods ending
prior to, on or including the Closing Date (such taxable period, a " _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ ") which have not yet been filed as of the Closing Date.
At least ten days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is filed,
the Buyer shall submit such Tax Return to the Representative for the
Representatives review and approval, which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld. Failure by the Buyer to timely file the Tax Returns required under
this Section 9.03 shall cause the Sellers to have no liability for any penalty
or interest due as a result of such failure to timely file, provided
that Representative received and approved the Tax Return in a timely manner.



 

32 (b) _Taxes Resulting From Liquidation of Liberty Propane GP and
Liberty Propane LP: Straddle Periods_. All Taxes (other than any Taxes
arising from a breach by the Companies of any representation or warranty or
breach by the Sellers of any covenant in this Agreement) resulting from any
liquidation of Sterling GP Blocker and Sterling LP Blocker (as permitted by
Section 9.03(e)) shall be allocated to and borne by the Buyer. In the case of
Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that begins on or
before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of
the period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on and
included the Closing Date (an interim closing of the books for all purposes
including under Sections 5.5 and 16.13 of the LP Agreement); provided that
Taxes resulting from extraordinary actions taken by Buyer at or after the
Effective Time on the Closing Date and not otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement shall be allocated to the Buyer; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Company, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period. 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. The Buyer will pay any transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp or registration Tax (but, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, specifically excluding any income Tax on income or gain) imposed on
the Companies or the Sellers as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties or
interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The Representative agrees to
cooperate with the Buyer in the filing of any returns with respect to the
Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its
possession reasonably requested by the Buyer that is reasonably necessary to
complete and file such returns.

(d) _Tax Proceedings_.

(i) The Buyer shall promptly notify the Representative in writing
upon receipt by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies)
of notice of any Tax audits, examinations or assessments that could give rise
to a liability for which the Sellers are responsible under Article VIII of
this Agreement. The Representative shall have the right to control any such
audit, examination or proceeding to the extent that it relates to any Taxes
for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to Article VIII of this
Agreement (it being 



 

33  understood that if an audit, examination or proceeding relates to a Straddle
Period, the Representative shall have the right to participate in any such
audit, examination or proceeding to the extent related to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, but if it is not feasible that the Representative participate in any
such examination or proceeding, the Buyer shall, if and to the extent such
matter is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the Sellers,
obtain the Representatives consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, prior to settling or compromising any such examination
or proceeding), provided, that the Representative provides notice to
the Buyer of its intent to control such proceeding within 20 days after
receiving notice of such matter the Sellers shall have the right at their
expense to participate in and control the conduct of such audit or proceeding;
the Buyer also may participate in any such audit or proceeding and, if the
Sellers do not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, the Buyer
may defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including
settling such audit or proceeding after five days prior written notice to the
Sellers setting forth the terms and conditions of settlement. In the event
that issues relating to a potential adjustment are required to be contested in
the same audit or proceeding as separate issues relating to a potential
adjustment for which the Buyer would be liable, the Buyer shall have the
right, at its expense, to control the audit or proceeding with respect to the
latter issues.

(ii) With respect to issues relating to a potential adjustment for which both
the Sellers and the Buyer or any Company could be liable, (i) both the
Sellers and the Buyer may participate in the audit or proceeding and (ii) the
audit or proceeding shall be controlled by that party which would bear the
burden of the greater portion for the sum of the adjustment and any
corresponding adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future
taxable periods. The principle set forth in this Section 9.03(d) also shall
govern for purposes of deciding any issue that must be decided jointly
(including choice of judicial forum) in situations in which separate issues
are otherwise controlled under this Section 9.03 by the Buyer and the Sellers.

(iii) With respect to any Tax audit or proceeding for a taxable period that
begins before the Closing Date, neither the Buyer nor the Sellers shall enter
into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to such audit or
proceeding which would materially adversely affect the other party for such
taxable period or a subsequent taxable period without the written consent of
the other party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. The Buyer
and the Sellers agree to cooperate, and the Buyer agrees to cause the Company
and the Subsidiaries to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any
claim in any such audits or proceeding.

Except as provided above, the Buyer shall control all other matters relating
to Taxes of the Companies.

(e) _Liquidation of Sterling GP Blocker and Sterling LP Blocker; Tax
Elections_. Subject to Section 9.03(b), the Buyer shall be authorized, in its
sole discretion, 



 

34  to adopt a plan of liquidation and liquidate Sterling LP Blocker and
Sterling GP Blocker effective as of any time after the Closing Date; provided
that the Buyer shall be liable for any Taxes arising or resulting from, and
shall indemnify the Sellers from any Losses incurred by the Sellers directly
in connection with, such liquidation (other than any such Losses arising from
a breach by the Companies of any representation or warranty or breach by the
Sellers of any covenant in this Agreement). The Buyer shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to, make any election under (i) Section 338 of
the Code (or any analogous or similar state or local, or foreign law or
regulation, if any) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or (ii) Treasury Regulation 301.7701-3 (or any analogous or similar
state or local, or foreign law or regulation) for any Company effective on or
before the Closing Date.

(f) _Other Liabilities_. The Buyer covenants that, without the prior written
consent of the Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), it will not, and will not cause or permit the Companies, or any
Affiliate of the Buyer to amend any Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or any Straddle Period, if such action would have the effect of increasing
the Tax liability or reducing any Tax benefit of the Sellers or any Affiliate
of the Sellers or would give rise to any indemnification obligation of the
Sellers under Section 8.02 unless such amendment is required under applicable
law. In addition, the Buyer covenants that without the prior written consent
of the Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) it
will not and will not cause or permit the Companies, or any Affiliate of the
Buyer, to (i) take any action on or after the Closing other than in the
ordinary course of business that would give rise to any Tax liability of the
Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers, or (ii) subject to Section
9.03(e), make or change any material Tax election, amend any Tax Return, or
take any Tax position on any Tax Return, in each case if such action would
have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing the Tax benefit of
the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers unless such action is required
under applicable law.

(g) _Refunds_. The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Companies to pay to the
Representative (for payment to the Sellers) any Tax refunds received by the
Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates on account of any employee
payroll taxes and/or withholding refunded as a result of reclassification of
an employee to a partner or other self-employed individual related to any
period prior to the Closing Date.

(h) _Statute of Limitations_. After the Closing Date, the Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Companies) will not, without the prior written
consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, agree to the waiver or any extension of the statute of limitations
relating to any Taxes of the Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Tax Period.

(i) _Time of Payment_. Payment by the Sellers or the Buyer, as applicable, of
any amounts due under this Article IX in respect of Taxes shall be made
directly by the Sellers or the Buyer, as applicable, (A) at least three
Business Days before the due date of the applicable estimated or final Tax
Return required to be filed by the Companies on which is required to be
reported income for a taxable period ending after the Closing Date for which
the Sellers are responsible under Sections 9.03(a) and 9.03(b) or (B) 



 

35  within three Business Days following an agreement between the Representative
and the Buyer that an indemnity amount is payable, an assessment of a Tax by a
taxing authority which is due and payable, or a "determination" as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code. If liability under this Article IX is in respect
of other Taxes, payment by the Sellers or the Buyer, as applicable, of any
amounts due under this Article IX in respect of such other Taxes shall be
made within five Business Days following an agreement between the
Representative and the Buyer that an indemnity amount is payable or an
assessment of a Tax by a taxing authority which is due and payable. 

(j) _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. From and after the Closing,
the Sellers and the Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the
Buyer shall cause the Companies to provide such cooperation and information)
in (A) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (B)
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, (C)
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
taxes, or (D) furnishing information to parties subsequently desiring to
purchase any part of the Assets, the business, or the Companies from the
Buyer. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work
papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing
authorities. The Sellers and the Buyer shall make themselves (and their
respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section 9.03.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the
Sellers and the Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all
material records or other documents in its possession (or in the possession of
its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Companies for any taxable
period that includes the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until
the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard
to extensions and (ii) six years following the due date (without extension)
for such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Sellers or the Buyer shall
dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates), the other party shall be given an opportunity, after 90 days
prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents
as such other party may select (at such other partys expense). Any
information obtained under this Section 9.03 shall be kept confidential,
except as otherwise may be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

9.04. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
Party hereto and at such Partys expense, any other Party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.05. _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, the Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Companies to, provide Representative and its
authorized representatives with reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books and 



 

36  records and any relevant personnel of the Companies with respect to periods
prior to the Closing Date in connection with any matter that reasonably may be
indemnifiable hereunder. Unless consented to in writing by Representative,
the Buyer shall not permit the Companies, for a period of four (4) years
following the Closing Date or such longer period if required by Section
9.03(j), to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books and records of
the Companies, or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the
Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior written notice to the
Representative and offering to surrender to the Representative such books
and records or such portions thereof.

9.06. _Employee Matters_.

(a) The Buyer covenants that following the Closing it shall provide healthcare
continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or Sections
601-608 of ERISA or similar state statute, to all current and former employees
of the Companies who are or become qualified beneficiaries (as defined in
Section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code) with respect to the Companies employee
benefit plans as well as make available to, and to the extent elected, provide
continuation coverage to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (as defined by
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4).

(b) The Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, hold harmless and
defend the Sellers with respect to, any notices, payments, benefits, fines,
penalties, backpay, and damages required under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN Act_ ") relating to any plant closing or
mass layoff (or similar triggering event) caused by the termination of any of
the Companies employees by the Buyer on or after Closing.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be liable for all claims
and liabilities under all welfare plans which were not discharged by the
Sellers or the Companies prior to the Closing Date, regardless of when such
claims or liabilities arise or are asserted. Credit shall be given to all
Employees and their eligible dependants and beneficiaries for any premiums,
co-payments and deductibles paid on or prior to the Closing Date in satisfying
any deductible and out-of-pocket expense requirements under such new group
medical plan for the current plan year.

(d) The Buyer will continue to sponsor and maintain the 401(k) plan of the
Company referenced in Section 5.13 of the Disclosure Schedules (the " _Liberty
401(k) Plan_ ") after the Closing until the Buyer determines it appropriate to
merge the Liberty 401(k) Plan into the Buyers 401(k) plan. The Buyer will
select the time at which the Employees will cease to participate in the
Liberty 401(k) Plan and will become immediately eligible to participate in the
Buyers 401(k) plan. All Employees will be credited with prior service with
the Companies and their Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to participate
in and vesting in the Buyers 401(k) plan.

9.07. _Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation_.

(a) _Covenant_. For and in consideration of the covenants, agreements and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Sterling Partners hereby grants to the
Buyer 



 

37  certain covenants not to compete and/or solicit (the " _Covenants_ ") on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 9.07. The Parties recognize and
agree that the Buyer would not be willing to enter into this Agreement nor
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without Sterling Partners
entering into the Covenants and that each Sterling Partners performance and
observance of this Section 9.07 is valuable consideration for the Buyer and
the Buyers willingness to enter into this Agreement and pay the Purchase
Price to the Sellers.

(b) _Noncompetition_. Sterling Partners covenants and agrees that, for and
during the three-year period commencing on the Closing Date, it shall not,
directly or indirectly, whether individually or in partnership or association
with any one or more Persons, or as a principal, partner, shareholder, agent,
employee, consultant, or contractor, or in any other capacity, engage in or
carry on in the Restricted Territory any activity that may be deemed to
compete or conflict with the Business other than on behalf of the Buyer and
its Affiliates.

(c)  _No Interference with the Companies_. Sterling Partners covenants and
agrees that, for and during the three-year period commencing on the Closing
Date, it shall not, directly or indirectly solicit or otherwise interfere with
any relationship between any Company, on the one hand, and any customer or
supplier of any Company, on the other hand. Sterling Partners covenants and
agrees that, for and during the three-year period commencing on the Closing
Date, it shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or hire for
employment (or assist anyone in soliciting or hiring for employment) any
individual employed by any Company as of the Closing Date; or (ii) induce, or
assist anyone in inducing, any individual employed by any Company as of the
Closing Date to resign or sever employment, or to terminate or breach any
Employment Agreement, with such Company.

(d) _Geographic Coverage_. The geographic coverage of the Covenants shall
include the area within a 50 mile radius of any Company Real Property, which
geographic coverage is referred to hereinafter collectively as the "
_Restricted Territory_."

(e) _No Violation of Public Policy_. The Parties expressly agree and
acknowledge the terms of this Section 9.07 are reasonable in scope, time and
territory, and are necessary to protect the value of the Purchased Equity
Interests and the Business purchased by the Buyer. The Parties further
acknowledge and agree that it is not their intention that the Covenants
violate any public policy or statutory or common law. If a court of competent
jurisdiction renders a ruling (sustained on appeal, if any) holding that any
one or more of the provisions of the Covenants, including the Restricted
Territory or stated term of the Covenants, constitute an unreasonable
restriction, then the Parties specifically agree that the Covenants shall not
be rendered void but shall apply to such extent and as to such time period
and Restricted Territory as such court may determine constitutes a reasonable
restriction under the circumstances.

9.08. _Assignment of Arbitration Award_. Each of the Parties hereto confirms
and agrees that at any time on or prior to the Closing, the Arbitration Award
shall be assigned to Taurus Acquisitions, LLC.
