AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises

the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows: ARTICLE 1.

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger; Effect of the Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the Utah BCA and the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Purchaser shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the Utah BCA and the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and the
Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and the Purchaser shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be as set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. At the
Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth
on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

(c) The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of
the Company or the Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or the Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to
be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be no later
than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those 

 



2  conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP,
1701 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. On the Closing
Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in writing,
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall cause articles of merger ("
_Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Division of
Corporations and Commercial Code of the State of Utah in accordance with the
Utah BCA and an appropriate certificate of merger to be executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the Utah BCA or DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles of Merger and
Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed or such other date and time
as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger and
Certificate of Merger, which date and time shall occur at the same instant
(such date and time being herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE 2.

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Common Shares
to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive $3.45, payable to the
holder in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
_Section 2.2(e)_, upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing
such Common Shares in accordance with  _Section 2.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Common Shares
that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
Company Subsidiary, and all Common Shares owned of record by Parent, the
Purchaser or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect
thereto.

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for purposes of
effecting the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration in connection
with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Common Shares
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, together
with the aggregate Warrant Payments. Such funds shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Common Shares. Earnings from
such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no
part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Common
Shares. 

 



3 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates that represented Common Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Common Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which Common Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Common Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry
Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. If payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest
thereon.

(c)  _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Common Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Common
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving

 



4  Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest and
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance
with _Section 2.2(e)_. If, prior to six years after the Effective Time (or
otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect
hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Merger Consideration or Warrant Payment otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Common Shares or Company
Warrants, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law,
including with respect to stock transfer Taxes payable by the seller. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such holder of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ hereof.

 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
payment for such Common Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 16-10a-1301, et seq. of the Utah BCA (such
Common Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 16-10a-1301, et seq. of
the Utah BCA. If any such shareholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses his right to demand payment under Section 16-10a-1301, et
seq. of the Utah BCA or other applicable Law, then the right of such
shareholder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease
and such Dissenting Shares shall be

 



5  deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law
in accordance with Section 2.2(e). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 16-10a-1301, et
seq. of the Utah BCA, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the Utah BCA and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the vesting and
exercisability of each then unexpired and unexercised option or similar
rights to purchase Company Common Stock (the " _Company Options_ "), granted
under any stock option plan of the Company, including the Companys 2006
Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or any other plan,
agreement or arrangement (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), held
by any Person then performing services as an employee, director or consultant
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully
accelerated, and (ii) each then unexpired and unexercised Company Option,
without regard to the identity of the holder, shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option
shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the
product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
subject to such Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "). From and after the Effective
Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of
the Option Payments. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take
all necessary action under the Company Stock Plans and the stock option
agreements evidencing the Company Options (including, to the extent necessary,
obtaining consent of the holders of the Company Options) to effectuate the
actions contemplated by this _Section 2.4(a)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the vesting of all then
unvested restricted shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted Stock_
") awarded under the Company Stock Plans held by any Person then performing
services as an employee, director or consultant of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be fully accelerated, and (ii) each then
outstanding share of Restricted Stock shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration on the terms and conditions set
forth in _Section 2.1(a)_, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by

 



6  applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall take all necessary action under the Company Stock
Plans and the restricted stock award agreements evidencing the Restricted
Stock (including, to the extent necessary, obtaining consent of the holders of
the Restricted Stock) to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section
2.4(b)_.

 

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options or
other rights with respect to Common Shares shall be granted thereunder.

2.5 _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase
Common Shares (the " _Company Warrants_ ") that is issued, unexpired and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and not terminated
pursuant to its terms in connection with the Merger shall be entitled to
receive upon the exercise of such Company Warrant a payment in cash (subject
to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Common Shares previously subject to such
Company Warrant and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per Common Share previously subject to such Company
Warrant (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Warrant
Payments_ "). From and after the Effective Time, any such Company Warrant

Common Shares or capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, but shall only
entitle such holder to the payment of the Warrant Payment upon exercise of
such Company Warrant. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to give
any necessary notices required under the Company Warrants that are required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the failure to have, or

be, prepared from, are in accordance with, and accurately reflect the books
and records of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries in all
material respects,

 



11  (B) have been or will be, as the case may be, prepared in accordance with

Goldstein Schechter Koch P.A. or Kramer Weisman and Associates, LLP have
resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountant of the Company as
a result of or in connection with any disagreement with the Company on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure, (ii) no executive officer of the Company has
failed in any respect to make, without qualification, the certifications

(a) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys system of internal control over
financial reporting is designed in all material respects to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the

could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. The
Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (and made summaries of such disclosures available to Parent)
(A) any significant deficiencies, material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all
effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any of their respective directors, officers, auditors,
accountants or representatives has received or has otherwise become aware of
any substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. No current or former attorney
representing the Company or any Company Subsidiary has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents, to the current Company Board or any
committee thereof or to any current director or executive officer of the
Company.

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of the NYSE Amex exchange.

Company and each Company Subsidiary have been, and are being, properly and
accurately maintained in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable) and
any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. The minute books of the Company and each Company Subsidiary,
all of which have been made available by the Company to Parent, contain
complete and correct records of all meetings and other corporate actions held
or taken since January 1, 2009 of their respective shareholders (or
equivalent) and boards of directors (or equivalent), including committees of
their respective boards of directors (or equivalent).

thereto under GAAP.

owned Company Subsidiary to the Company or another wholly-owned Company
Subsidiary) or enter into any agreement with respect to the voting or

understanding or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation
or other benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee or

limitation, all incentive, bonus, deferred compensation, vacation, holiday,
cafeteria, medical, disability, stock purchase, stock option, stock
appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock or other stock-based
compensation plans, policies, programs, practices or arrangements (each a "

_ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean any entity (whether or not incorporated) other
than the Company that, together with the Company, is required to be treated

 



14  as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. True
and complete copies of each Company Benefit Plan and all amendments thereto
have been made available by the Company to Parent.

(b) To the Companys Knowledge, each Company Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
all applicable Laws.

(c) There is no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened legal
action, suit or claim relating to the Company Benefit Plans (other than
routine claims for benefits), including any audit or inquiry from the Internal
Revenue Service or the United States Department of Labor.

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code either (i) has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to its qualified status or the remedial amendment period for
such Company Benefit Plan has not yet expired, or (ii) may rely upon a
favorable prototype opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and to
the Companys Knowledge no fact or event has occurred that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit
Plan.

 

(e) To the Companys Knowledge there has been no prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code,
other than a transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative
exemption) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

(f) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) (" _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or other pension plan that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate sponsors, maintains, contributes to or has an obligation to
contribute to, or has, within the past six years, sponsored, maintained,
contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to a Multiemployer Plan or
other pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(g) No Company Benefit Plan exists and there are no other contracts, plans or
arrangements (written or otherwise) covering any current or former employee,
director, officer, contractor, consultant or shareholder of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that, individually or collectively, as a result of
the execution of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any other event(s)), would
reasonably be expected to result in the payment or series of payments by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any person of an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to compensate any Person for
excise taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code) has an exercise price that
has been or may be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock as
of the date such

 



15  Company Option was granted or has any feature for the deferral of
compensation that could render the grant subject to Section 409A of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has granted any Company
Options by use of backdating or other methods to target a grant date to
achieve a lower exercise price than would have otherwise been utilized if such
Company Option was granted on the date such grant was first duly authorized
the Company or Company Subsidiary.

(i) No payments or benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or other agreement
of Company or any Company Subsidiary are, or are expected to be, subject to
the disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been party to any arrangement that is
or was a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code. Any Company Benefit Plan that is deemed to
constitute a nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A
of the Code has been operated and administered in all material respects with
Section 409A of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
an obligation to indemnify, hold harmless or gross-up any Person with respect

(c) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in compliance with
all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices,

event no later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, and Parent and
the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Company in such preparation and filing
of, a preliminary Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, (x) if the Company does not receive comments
from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company
shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy
Statement to the shareholders of the Company, after the tenth calendar day
following the date of filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC,
and (y) if the Company does receive comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall file with the SEC the
definitive Proxy Statement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the shareholders of the
Company, following clearance by the SEC with respect to such comments. The
Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information
concerning the Company, Parent or the Purchaser as the other party hereto may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall in its reasonable
judgment be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement before such document (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is
filed with the SEC, and the Company shall include in such document any
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall (i)
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and advise Parent and its counsel
of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) received from the SEC or its staff, (ii) provide Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Companys proposed
response to such comments, (iii) in its reasonable judgment include in the
Companys written response to such comments any comments reasonably
proposed by Parent and its counsel, (iv) not file or mail such document, or
respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval

the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should have been
included in the Proxy Statement or should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company.

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (x) withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
the Purchaser), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation,
(y) recommend, adopt or approve or

 



29  publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal, or
take any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to any Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification), or (z) take any other action or make any other public
statement inconsistent with such Company Board Recommendation (any action
described in this sentence being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_
").

(d) The Company shall establish a record date (which will be as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, which meeting
the Company shall cause to occur on the 30th calendar day (or, if such
calendar day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day subsequent to
such calendar day) immediately following the date of mailing of the Proxy
Statement (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, regardless of whether the Company
Board determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that the shareholders of the Company reject it or any other Change
of Recommendation has occurred at any time; provided, however, that (i) if the
Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its shareholders at such time, the
Company may adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting for no more than five
(5) Business Days if necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts during such five (5)
Business Day period to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable, (ii)
the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the
extent (and only to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such
adjournment or postponement is required by applicable Law and (iii) if the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, or the price or material terms of a
previously received Acquisition Proposal are modified or amended, in any such
case during the five (5) Business Day period immediately prior to the day of
the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company may delay the Company
Shareholders Meeting until the date that is the seventh (7th) Business Day
after the date on which the Company Shareholders Meeting would have been held
but for such extension. Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Change
of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.5_, the Company Board shall
make the Company Board Recommendation and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, and the Company shall otherwise
comply with all applicable Laws applicable to the Company Shareholders
Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees
that (x) its obligations pursuant to this  _Section 5.2(d)_ shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal,
and (y) the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and the matters constituting
the Company Shareholder Approval shall be submitted to the Companys
shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting whether or not (A) a Change
of Recommendation shall have occurred or (B) any Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise
submitted to the Company or any of its representatives. The Company agrees
that it shall not submit to the vote of the shareholders of the Company any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of
the Companys shareholders with respect to the Merger at the Company
Shareholders Meeting. The notice of such Company Shareholders Meeting shall
state that a resolution to approve this Agreement and a resolution to adjourn
the Company Shareholders Meeting will be considered at the Company
Shareholders Meeting, and no other matters shall be considered or voted upon
at the Company Shareholders Meeting without Parents prior written consent.

 



30 5.3 _Cooperation_. The Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in
connection with (a) the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Filings, (b) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required, or any actions are required to be
taken under, or consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained
from parties to, any Company Material Contracts, in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) timely
taking any such actions, seeking any such consents, approvals or waivers or
making any such filings or furnishing information required in connection
therewith or with the Proxy Statement or any Other Filings.

5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party (the applicable provisions of which the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the counterparty thereto to waive), from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and
other representatives (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") to: (i)
provide to Parent and the Purchaser and their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and
other representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ ") access
at reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its Subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof (including Tax Returns) and (ii) furnish
promptly such information concerning the business, properties, contracts,
assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of such party and
its Subsidiaries as Parent or the Parent Representatives may reasonably
request. No investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify or limit any representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement.

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to _Section 5.4(a)_,
Parent shall comply with, and shall cause the Parent Representatives to
comply with, all of its obligations under the Nondisclosure Agreement, dated
as of January 23, 2012, by and between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

5.5 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to _Section 5.5(b)_, from and after the date hereof , the Company
shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and direct the Company
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage (including by way of providing information) the submission
of any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise participate in or facilitate
any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations, (ii) enter
into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement relating to

 



31  an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder,
(iii) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation, or any restrictive provision of
any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Companys articles of
incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company
shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have
been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent or any of Parents
Affiliates, under any such provisions), or (iv) resolve or agree to do any of
the foregoing. The Company shall immediately cease and promptly hereafter (but
in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after the date hereof) cause to
be terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted heretofore by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, or any of the
Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be returned or destroyed
all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to such Person.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.5(a)_,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Companys receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval (i) the Company has received a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party and (ii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would be
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) will not, will not allow
the Company Subsidiaries to, and will instruct the Company Representatives not
to, disclose any information to such Person without first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will promptly provide to Parent
any information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries provided
to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent in the event that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary other
than requests for information in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any
inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
provide to Parent a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (or,
where no such copy is available, a reasonable description of the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), including
any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a current basis (and in any event at Parents request and otherwise no
later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (including the material terms and conditions
thereof and of any material modification thereto), and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event

 



32  within 24 hours) notify Parent if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to  _Section 5.5(b)_ and shall give advance
written notice of at least five (5) Business Days to Parent and the Purchaser
(the " _Notice Period_ ") before effecting a Change of Recommendation relating
to a Superior Proposal pursuant to clause (x) of Section 5.5(d) or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to clause (y) of Section 5.5 (d) (which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal, including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.5(a)_,
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board
may, at any time prior to the Companys receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval (x) effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal, or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case so long as it has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and after
giving due consideration to all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement
which may be offered by Parent, that such action would be required by its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of
Recommendation relating to a Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing
clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
unless the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives (including members of the Company Board and its advisors) to
negotiate during the Notice Period with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its shareholders
in favor of approval of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a Change
of Recommendation.

5.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) The Company, Parent and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or

Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from
any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the

other applicable Antitrust Law), in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, including without limitation the Merger, and
(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof or the expiration of any applicable legal

period), (B) the HSR Act, (C) any other applicable Antitrust Law and (D) any
other applicable Law. The Company, Parent and the Purchaser shall furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing under

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (iii) required to prevent
a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ that the Company and Parent shall
coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Company
Material Contracts in connection with consummation of the Merger and seeking
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either
party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first
sentence of this _Section 5.6(b)_, such party shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other
party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent,
their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or
which could reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from
the failure to obtain such consent.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.6_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the
other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the
other parties of any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission,
the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the
Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties
and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection
with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that Parent and the Company shall make the final decision
mutually with respect to the content of such materials or submissions. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of
the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding

 



34  and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the
Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person,
and (ii) neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall be required to pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash
or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.6(a), Parent shall
not have any obligation under this Agreement to (and the Company shall not
unless requested by Parent to do so) agree to any structural or conduct relief
or to litigate in order to effect the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.7 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this  _Section 5.7_ shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

5.8 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. The Company, Parent and the Purchaser agree that the press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint
release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the
Company and Parent.

 

5.9 _Company 401(k) Plan_. The Company shall adopt a resolution terminating
the Dreams, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") effective as of or
immediately prior to the Closing Date. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the
401(k) Plan has been terminated and shall also take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating the 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require.
In

 



35  the event that termination of the 401(k) Plan would reasonably be
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees,
then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges or fees and provide such estimate in
writing to Parent no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

 

5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and
employees of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than
are currently set forth in the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws.
The indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
following the Effective Time. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall purchase for the benefit of the
Companys directors and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification tail policy that provides
coverage for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") that
is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies which
have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be required to purchase the DandO Tail Policy
if such policy exceeds 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement multiplied by six (6) (such aggregate amount, the " _Base
Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if such insurance coverage can only
be obtained at a total premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall
purchase the most advantageous policy of directors and officers insurance
obtainable for a total premium equal to the Base Premium. Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 

(d) The obligations under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
_Section 5.10_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.10_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 5.10_).

5.11 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"business combination" or other anti-takeover Laws becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or the Purchaser, the Merger or the Support
Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company Board shall take all action necessary to render such Law inapplicable
to the foregoing.

 



36 5.12 _Parent Agreement Concerning the Purchaser_. Parent agrees to cause the
Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board,
or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered Person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Options pursuant to
this Agreement or Common Shares pursuant to the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible. 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company Disclosure
Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and

 



49  undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

8.9 _Assignment_. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties, _provided_ that Parent or the Purchaser may assign any of their
respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or the Purchaser, as the
case may be, of its obligations hereunder.

8.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than
pursuant to  _Section 5.10_, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words
"include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be
terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be
deemed to be exclusive.

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) The Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and all disputes between the parties under or related to this
Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (other than with respect to matters
relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board, the Merger, the Utah BCA
and any other matters mandatorily governed by Utah law, with respect to which
Utah law shall apply), without regard to laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any appellate court therefrom in the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware and
any appellate court therefrom), in any action or proceeding

 



50  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in any such court, (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such
court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in
the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.12(c).

8.13  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

8.14 _Specific Performance_ . The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

8.15 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein. No former,

 



51  current or future direct or indirect equity holders, Controlling Persons,
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees of the Company, Parent or
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability
or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, obligations or liabilities of the Company, Parent or the
Purchaser under this Agreement or of or for any action, suit, arbitration,
claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether
based on Contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether
by piercing the corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto
or another Person or otherwise.

 



52 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
