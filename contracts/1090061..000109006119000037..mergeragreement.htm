"Shares"), other than (a) Dissenting Shares, (b) Shares owned by Parent or any

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Ohio (the "OGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation.
The Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Surviving Corporation".

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Jones Day, North Point, 901 Lakeside Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44114, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 10:00
a.m. local time on the fourth Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction or waiver of any such
condition) set forth in Article VII or at such other place, time and date as
the Company and Parent may mutually agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing shall occur is referred to as the "Closing Date".

Section 1.3 Effective Time. At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall
file with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio a certificate of merger
(the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance with, and containing
such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the OGCL in
order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Ohio or at such time as may be agreed between the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the OGCL (such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time").

Section 1.4 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the OGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and
authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.5 Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time and subject to Section 6.8, the amended and
restated articles of incorporation of the Company (the "Articles of
Incorporation") and the amended and restated code of regulations of the
Company (the "Code of Regulations"), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be
in the form of the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of Merger
Sub, and as so amended shall be the articles of incorporation and



-6-

* * *





code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and
(b) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.7 Subsequent Actions. If, at or any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in
or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other
actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

ARTICLE II 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Each Share (other than Company Restricted Shares, which shall be treated
as provided in Section 2.3(a), and any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the
right to receive $10.15 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"), payable to the holder of each such Share upon surrender of
either certificates formerly representing such Shares ("Certificates") or any
book-entry Shares ("Book-Entry Shares") in the manner provided in Section 2.2.
All such Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be
automatically cancelled, retired and cease to exist. Each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect
to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
Shares upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with Section 2.2.



-7-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





(b) Each (i) share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company, (ii) Share owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii)
Dissenting Share will be cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other
consideration will be made with respect to such shares subject, in the case of
Dissenting Shares, to the right of the holder thereof to receive any payment
under Section 2.4.

(c) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 Payment; Surrender of Shares; Share Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into an agreement, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with the Company's transfer
agent to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for payment of the Merger
Consideration. At or immediately prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in a separate account in trust
for the benefit of holders of Shares (other than holders of any Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)) (the "Payment Fund"), the aggregate
Merger Consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 2.1(a).

(b) (i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event
within three Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share whose
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which letter of transmittal will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(f)) to
the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(f)) or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may
thereafter surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon
delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and
such other customary documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such
instructions and the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares on or
before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares
represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares. Until so
surrendered, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares representing (1)



-8-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





Dissenting Shares, (2) Shares held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, and (3) shares of Company Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company) will represent solely the right to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
Section 2.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares.

(i) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Shares cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name surrendered Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to
such payment that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax is not applicable.

(ii) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
Section 2.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article II will be paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(a), subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation
to pay any dividends or make any other distributions, in each case with a
record date (A) prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, or (B) prior to the date of this Agreement, and in each case, which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of the Company's capital stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares (other than
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing (i) Dissenting Shares, (ii)
Shares held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company) are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled
and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. No
interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that immediately before the Effective Time
represented the Shares.

(d) Promptly following the date that is one year after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any cash, including any interest received with respect to such cash, and
any Certificates or other documents in its possession relating to the
Transactions that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
previously delivered to the Surviving Corporation.

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





Thereafter, such holders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) for
payment of their claim for any Merger Consideration; provided, that if any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which such consideration in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of a
Governmental Entity, any such consideration in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
their respective directors, officers or employees will be liable to any holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.3, such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under any applicable Tax
Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that any amounts
are so withheld or deducted and remitted to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or from amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.3 in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made.

(f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or, at the
election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in such amount as Parent or the
Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section
2.2(d), Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate.

(g) Parent will cause the Paying Agent to invest all cash included in the
Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that Parent shall
procure that (i) any investment of such cash will be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, and, in any such case, no such
instrument will have a maturity exceeding three months, and (ii) no such
investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to



-10-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





Section 2.2(d). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Article II, Parent will promptly replace or restore the portion of the
Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments.

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) Company Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, each restricted share of
Company Common Stock subject to certain vesting conditions and restrictions
(each, a "Company Restricted Share") that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent applicable, no longer be
subject to any vesting conditions or restrictions, as applicable, and each
such Company Restricted Share shall be cancelled, and shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each restricted share unit
corresponding to Company Common Stock (each, a "Company RSU") outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
be cancelled, and the right to receive Company Common Stock pursuant thereto
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) Company Performance Shares. At the Effective Time, each award of
performance shares corresponding to Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Performance Share") outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled, and that number of shares of Company Common Stock that
would have been earned at target performance shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.

(d) Payment Timing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but no later than the first regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay the Merger Consideration (without interest and less
applicable Tax withholdings) to each holder of a Company Restricted Share,
each holder of a Company RSU and each holder of a Company Performance Share,
in accordance with Sections 2.3(a), 2.3(b) and 2.3(c) above; provided, that,
with respect to any Company RSU or Company Performance Share that constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and
that is not permitted to be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the
terms of such Company Equity Award that will not trigger a Tax or penalty
under Section 409A of the Code.



-11-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





(e) Deferred Compensation. All account balances (whether or not vested) under
any Company Plan (other than awards under a Company Stock Plan, the treatment
of which is specified in Sections 2.3(b) and (c)) that provides for the
deferral of compensation, representing amounts notionally invested in a number
of Shares or otherwise providing for distributions or benefits that are
calculated based on the value of a Share (collectively, the "Deferred
Compensation Plans") shall be adjusted and converted into a right of the
holder to have allocated to the holder's account under the applicable Deferred
Compensation Plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (i)
the number of Shares deemed invested under or otherwise referenced by such
account immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration or, if higher, the highest closing price for a Share on the New
York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") during the ninety calendar days preceding the
Closing Date (the "Deferred Payment") and shall cease to represent a right to
receive a number of Shares or amount equal to or based on the value of a
number of Shares. The Deferred Payment shall be made at the time specified in
the applicable Deferred Compensation Plan and related plan documents, less any
applicable Tax withholdings.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the applicable committee
thereof will adopt appropriate resolutions and take such other actions as are
necessary to provide that (i) the Company Stock Plans and all awards issued
thereunder (including the Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs and Company
Performance Shares) will terminate as of the Effective Time and (ii) the
provisions in any other plan, program, arrangement or agreement providing for
the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the equity of the
Company shall be of no further force or effect and shall terminate as of the
Effective Time, subject, in each case, to the payments in consideration
thereof as set forth in this Article II.

Section 2.4 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a Person (a
"Dissenting Shareholder") who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and has complied in all respects with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL
(such Shares, "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a), but at the
Effective Time shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder in
accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. If any such holder withdraws its
demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of
appraisal pursuant to the OGCL with respect to such Shares, or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, such Shares shall be deemed
not to be Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
such Share, without interest and subject to Section 2.2. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of Shares
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served on the Company pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL.

Section 2.5 Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock,
of the Company shall change as a result of any merger, business combination,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this Section
2.5 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect
to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

hereof, addressed to Parent and Merger Sub (the "Company Disclosure Letter")

1, 2017 and prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, except, in the

and to perform its other obligations under this Agreement, has not been
breached.

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it
or any of its Affiliates will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
warranty, covenant or obligation prior to or on Closing to be satisfied by
Parent or its Affiliates contained in the Financing Agreements, the non-
satisfaction of which would limit, delay or prevent the borrowing of funds
under the Financing Agreements to finance the Required Amount.

Section 4.7 No Prior Activities. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Transactions and the Financing and, prior to the
Effective Time, will have engaged in no other business activities and will
have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein
(including the Financing) and matters ancillary thereto. As of the date of
this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000
shares of common stock, no par value per share, all of which are validly
issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub is, and immediately prior to the Effective Time will be, owned
directly or indirectly by Parent.

Section 4.8 Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a party or subject to, or in default
under, any Order that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal, (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent or Merger

connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, a Company

principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement as permitted by Section 5.2(b)) (each, a "Company
Acquisition Agreement"). Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all discussions or

Proposal, (B) promptly request each Person, if any, that has executed a

or destroy all information heretofore furnished to such Person or its

granted to any such Person or its Representatives. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any "standstill" or similar agreement to

provisions of any such agreement; provided that the Company shall be permitted
to fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of
any Person to permit such Person to make a Company Takeover Proposal
confidentially to the Company Board if the Company Board or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a) or
any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time on or after the date
hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval the Company or
any of its Representatives receives a bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal from any Person or group of Persons that did not result from a breach
of Section 5.2, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such
Person or group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and
(ii) if the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal and that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its
Representatives may (A) furnish, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
between the Company and such Person with provisions on terms that, taken as a
whole, are not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not include any "standstill" or similar provision) (each, an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), information (including material non-
public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person or

* * *





group of Persons who has made such Company Takeover Proposal (and to the
extent that material non-public information has not been furnished to Parent
and is furnished to such Person or Persons, the Company will concurrently
provide to Parent such material non-public information) and (B) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
of Persons making such Company Takeover Proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify
Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal are received by the Company
or any of its Representatives, and shall include with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions of such proposals or offers
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including draft agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (but in no event more than
once every 48 hours), of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers
(including any amendments thereto and any draft agreements) and any related
discussions or negotiations. The Company agrees that the Company and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with
any Person subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent as required by this Section 5.2.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(d) or by Section 5.2(e),
neither the Company, the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement, (B)
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation, (C) make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation
against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication (it
being understood that the Company Board may refrain from taking a position
with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal until the close of business as of
the tenth Business Day after the commencement of a tender offer in connection
with such Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act without such action being considered a Company Recommendation
Change) or (D) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend to the Company Shareholders, a Company Takeover Proposal (the
actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company
Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board or
any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof may, in response to a
Company Takeover Proposal, either (1) make a Company Recommendation Change or
(2) cause the Company to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement providing
for a Superior Proposal and concurrently terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) if, in the case of clause (1) or (2), the Company Board or any
duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that (1) the failure to do so would be inconsistent with



-41-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2) such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; provided, however,
that prior to taking such action, (w) the Company has provided Parent a copy
of such Company Takeover Proposal and has given Parent at least four Business
Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, (x) if Parent
requests, the Company has negotiated, and has directed its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period to enable
Parent to propose in writing an offer binding on Parent to effect revisions to
the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (y) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board or any duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof shall have considered in good faith Parent's
binding offer, and shall have determined that the Company Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed
in Parent's binding offer were to be given effect and the failure to make such
determination would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (z) in the event of any material change to the material
terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (w) above and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that the
notice period shall be at least two Business Days (rather than the four
Business Days otherwise contemplated by clause (w) above).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof may make a Company Recommendation
Change if the Company Board or such committee has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that,
as a result of a Company Intervening Event, the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; provided, however, that such action shall not be in response to a Company
Takeover Proposal (which is governed by Section 5.2(d)) and prior to taking
such action, (i) the Company Board has given Parent at least four Business
Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
description of the reasons for the Company Recommendation Change, (ii) if
Parent requests, the Company has negotiated, and has directed its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period to enable Parent to propose in writing an offer binding on Parent to
effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would
obviate the need for making such Company Recommendation Change, (iii)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof shall have considered in good
faith such binding offer, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to effect a Company Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (iv) in the event of
any material developments with respect to such Company Intervening Event, the
Company shall have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with
that described in clause (i) above and the notice period shall have
recommenced.

Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company
Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act after the commencement of a tender offer or
from making any other disclosure to the Company Shareholders if, in the
Company Board's determination in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with
its obligations under applicable Law; provided, however, that (i)
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in and of itself shall not be considered a Company Recommendation
Change, and (ii) in no event shall the Company Board or any duly constituted
and authorized committee thereof make a Company Recommendation Change except
in accordance with Section 5.2(d) or Section 5.2(e). Nothing contained in this
Section 5.2 shall be deemed to limit the last sentence of Section 6.7.

reasonably practicable, (i) correct any information provided by it
specifically for use in the Company Proxy Statement, the Parent Circular and
the Parent Prospectus if and to the extent that such information shall have

of the Parent Shareholder Resolutions and will use any power of attorney
granted in any such undertaking or other voting commitment in consultation and
in accordance with the instructions of the Company.

(e) The Parent Shareholders meeting shall be convened to take place on a date
which is no more than 17 days after the date on which the Parent Circular is

Section 6.3 Parent Recommendation Change.

(a) Except as permitted by this Section 6.3, Parent shall not, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and
employees, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its
Representatives not to, from the date hereof until the Effective Time or the
earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, (i)
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Parent Takeover Proposal, (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, a Parent Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement with respect to a Parent Takeover Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.3(a) or
any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time on or after the date
hereof and prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, Parent or any
of its Representatives receives a bona fide written Parent Takeover Proposal
from any Person or group of Persons that did not result from a breach of
Section 6.3(a), (i) Parent and its Representatives may contact such Person or
group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the
Parent Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and its duties under
Section 172 of the



-46-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





UK Companies Act, then Parent and its Representatives may (A) furnish
information (including material non-public information) with respect to Parent
and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Parent Takeover Proposal and (B) engage in or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such
Parent Takeover Proposal.

(c) Parent shall promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify the
Company if any proposals or offers with respect to, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Parent Takeover Proposal are received by Parent or
any of its Representatives and shall include with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions of such proposals or offers
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including draft agreements) and thereafter shall keep the Company
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (but in no event more than
once every 48 hours), of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers
(including any amendments thereto and any draft agreements) and any related
discussions or negotiations; provided that the obligations of Parent under
this Section 6.3(c) shall be subject to the Company entering into a non-
disclosure agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the Parent Takeover
Proposal with Parent on customary terms reasonably required by Parent.

(d) Neither Parent, the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall fail to
make, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, or
publicly propose to fail to make, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to the Company, or publicly propose to fail to make, withdraw, qualify
or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Recommendation (any
of the foregoing in this sentence, a "Parent Recommendation Change");
provided, however, that prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval,
the Parent Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof may
in response to a Parent Intervening Event effect a Parent Recommendation
Change, if the Parent Board or such committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that such Parent Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior
Proposal and, as a result of such Parent Intervening Event, the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and its duties under Section 172 of the UK Companies Act;
provided, however, that prior to taking such act, (i) Parent has given the
Company at least four Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to
take such action, (ii) if the Company requests, Parent has negotiated, and has
directed its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the Company
during such notice period to enable the Company to propose in writing an offer
binding on the Company to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement in
such a manner that would obviate the need for making such Parent
Recommendation Change, (iii) following the end of such notice period, the
Parent Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof shall
have considered in good faith the Company's binding offer, and shall have
determined that the failure to effect a Parent Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and its duties
under Section 172 of the UK Companies Act and (iv) in the event of any
material developments with respect to such Parent Intervening Event, Parent
shall have delivered to the Company an additional notice consistent with that



-47-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





described in clause (i) above and the notice period shall have recommenced;
provided, further, that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, Parent shall give notice of the Parent Shareholders
Meeting, the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall be convened and held, in each
such case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Parent
Shareholder Resolutions shall be submitted for approval to the Parent
Shareholders at the Parent Shareholders Meeting notwithstanding any Parent
Recommendation Change.

Section 6.4 Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Approval Matters.

(a) Subject to Section 6.4(d), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions and do or cause to be done all things necessary, required or advisable
to cause each of the conditions in Article VII to be satisfied and consummate
and make effective the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable (and
in any event prior to the Outside Date), including (i) making all Filings
necessary in connection with the Transactions, (ii) obtaining all Approvals
necessary in connection with the Transactions and (iii) defending or
contesting any Action brought by a Governmental Entity or any other Person
that could prohibit, prevent, restrict, adversely affect or delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.4(a) but subject to Section
6.4(d), each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions and do or cause to be done all things necessary, required
or advisable under the Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date), including (i)
obtaining all Approvals under the Antitrust Laws, (ii) resolving any objection
asserted with respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws raised by
any Governmental Entity or other Person, (iii) avoiding the entry of or
causing the vacation, dissolution, lifting or reversal of any Order under the
Antitrust Laws, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that prohibits,
prevents, restricts, adversely affects or delays the consummation of the
Transactions and (iv) defending or contesting any Actions brought by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person under the Antitrust Laws challenging
the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
party agrees to make an appropriate Filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR
Act as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 15
Business Days following the date of this Agreement and (ii) each party agrees
to make the appropriate Filings pursuant to any other Antitrust Laws as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and
in all cases, to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to the
applicable Governmental Entity any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws.

(c) Parent shall, in addition to its obligations to use reasonable best
efforts set forth in Section 6.4(a) and Section 6.4(b), through Order, consent
decree, settlement or otherwise, (i) license, sell, divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of Parent's, the Company's
or their respective Affiliates'



-48-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





operations, divisions, subsidiaries, assets, products, product lines or
businesses (whether now owned or hereafter acquired), (ii) terminate or modify
any existing relationships or contracts of Parent, the Company or their
respective Affiliates, or enter into new relationships or contracts, (iii)
amend or terminate any licenses or other intellectual property agreements of
Parent, the Company, or their respective Affiliates, and enter into new
licenses or other intellectual property agreements, and (iv) make behavioral
commitments that may limit or modify Parent's, the Company's or their
respective Affiliates' rights of ownership in, or freedom of action with
respect to, one or more of their respective operations, divisions,
subsidiaries, assets, products, product lines or businesses, in the case of
each of clauses (i) through (iv), to enable the Closing of the Transactions as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date).
Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to enter into any contract or
other binding obligation to implement any such sale, divestiture, contract,
license or similar remedial action under this Section 6.4(c) (a "Remedial
Action") unless such contract or obligation is conditioned on the occurrence
of the Closing or is only effective after the Effective Time.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to, and the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any other Affiliates of the Company shall not
without Parent's prior written approval, take or agree or commit to take any
action, or agree or commit to any condition or restriction, necessary,
required or advisable under the Antitrust Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions if such action, condition or restriction would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole (any such action, condition or restriction, a "Burdensome
Condition").

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Antitrust Law and subject to
appropriate confidentiality protections, each of Parent and the Company shall
(i) in the case of Parent, keep the Company reasonably informed of all
matters, discussions and activities pursued with third parties under Section
6.4(b), (ii) promptly notify the other party of, and, if in writing, provide
to the other party copies of (or in the case of oral communications, advise
the other orally of) all communications between it (or its Affiliates or
Representatives) and any Governmental Entity or other Person challenging the
Transactions and all information supplied by such party (or its Affiliates or
Representatives) to such Persons, (iii) promptly notify the other party of the
commencement or threatened commencement of any Action relating to the
consummation of, or any challenges to, the Transactions, (iv) permit the other
party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
and proposals, if applicable, of the other party (including, with respect to
Parent, the Company's reasonable suggestions relating to potential
divestitures and counterparties and potential defenses to any Action) in
connection with any Filings, agreements, settlements, notifications or
communications (whether written or oral) to be made by it or its Affiliates
with any Governmental Entity or other Person so challenging the Transactions,
including any presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or



-49-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





proposals, (v) to the extent practicable, not participate (and not permit its
Affiliates or Representatives to participate) in any telephone calls or
meetings with a Governmental Entity or other Person so challenging the
Transactions without consulting with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or such other Person, giving the
other party a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate thereat and
(vi) promptly furnish to the other party such other necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material" or some similar notation agreed by
the parties. Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
or its Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.4, and without limiting the restrictions on access
and disclosure set forth in this Section 6.4(f), materials provided to the
other party or its counsel pursuant to this Agreement may be redacted (i) as
necessary to comply with contractual requirements, (ii) as necessary to
address attorney-client or other privilege or protection or confidentiality
concerns and (iii) to remove references concerning pricing and other
competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective; provided that the
Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
establish mutually agreed "clean team" or similar procedures to enable the
provision of any such information to the extent permitted under applicable
Law.

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall, or shall agree to,
directly or indirectly, make or enter into any acquisition, disposition,
merger, business combination or any similar transaction, however structured,
or enter into any license, joint venture or similar agreement, transaction or
arrangement to the extent that such action would, or would reasonably be
expected to, in each case or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, including Parent's
obligations under this Agreement to obtain Approvals under the Antitrust Laws.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall,
after prior, good faith consultation with the Company and after considering,
in good faith, the Company's views, sole decision-making authority for all
aspects of the parties' strategy relating to obtaining all Approvals under the
Antitrust Laws; provided that (i) Parent and its Affiliates shall not consent
to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period, or
consent to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Transactions, or
withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Filing made pursuant to any other Antitrust Law, unless, in each case, the
Company has given its prior written consent to such extension, delay or
withdrawal (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and (ii) Parent's decision-making authority under this clause (h)
shall not be deemed to



-50-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





modify, amend, diminish or otherwise impair in any respect the Company's
rights set forth in the last two sentences of Section 5.1.

(i) Parent shall be responsible for the payment of all filing and other fees
in connection with the Filings to be made, and Approvals to be obtained,
pursuant to this Section 6.4 (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, fees and
expenses of the Company's legal counsel).

Section 6.5 Notification of Certain Matters. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall give reasonably prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonably prompt notice to the Company of
(a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause any condition to the
Merger to be unsatisfied at the Effective Time and (b) any material failure of
the Company or Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available under this Agreement to the party receiving such notice and (ii) a
failure to comply with this Section 6.5 shall not constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying
change or event would independently result in the failure of a condition set
forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

Section 6.6 Access; Confidentiality. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement
and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, the Company agrees
to provide Parent and its Representatives, from time to time prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VIII, reasonable access during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company in connection with the
Transactions and the Financing to (a) the Company's properties, books,
financial reporting, tax returns, Contracts, personnel and records and (b)
such other information as Parent may reasonably request with respect to the
Company and its business, assets, liabilities, financial condition and
operations, provided, that nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) provide such access at times or in a manner
that the Company's Representatives reasonably believe is likely to disrupt the
ordinary course operations of the businesses of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (ii) disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives
that is reasonably likely to cause a violation of any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, is reasonably likely to cause a
risk of a loss of attorney-client privilege to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or that is competitively sensitive information (provided that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access in a
manner that does not result in such a violation of a Contract, the loss of
attorney-client privilege or sharing of competitively sensitive information
with individuals that would not be permitted under applicable Law); provided,
further, that Parent and its Representatives shall not have the right to
perform any invasive or subsurface investigations of any Site. Parent shall
and shall cause Parent's Affiliates and Representatives to keep confidential
any non-public information received from the Company, its Affiliates or
Representatives, directly



-51-

or indirectly, pursuant to this Section 6.6 in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.7 Publicity. The Company and Parent shall each have prepared an
initial public announcement of this Agreement and shall have provided each
other with the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such initial
announcement prior to its issuance, which comments the issuing party shall
have considered in good faith. Thereafter, until the Effective Time or earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, none of the
Company, Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect
to this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consultation of the
other party and giving the other party the opportunity to review and comment
on such press release or other announcement, except (a) as required by
applicable Law, by any listing agreement with or rules of any applicable
national securities exchange, trading market or listing authority, or as may
be requested by a Governmental Entity or (b) with respect to communications
that are substantially similar to communications previously approved pursuant
to this Section 6.7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 shall cease to apply from and after the time of any Company
Recommendation Change.

Section 6.8 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Action or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party is
or was a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or a director, officer, employee, agent,
trustee or fiduciary of another Person serving at the request of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries), or (ii) acts or omissions by such Indemnified
Party in the Indemnified Party's capacity as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (or
a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or taken at
the request of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (or such other
person), in each case, with respect to such service, acts or omissions under
clauses (i) or (ii), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Merger or the
enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted or required
by applicable Law. In addition, from and after the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, upon demand by the Indemnified Party, advance any
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnified
Party under this Section 6.8 (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 6.8) as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided,



-52-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





that the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it shall be determined by a final, non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.8.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will guarantee,
and the Surviving Corporation will maintain in force all obligations of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries in respect of rights of exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the respective constituent documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or in any written Contract described on the Company Disclosure
Letter or filed as an exhibit to any document filed with the SEC or available
under applicable Law; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
will continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
claim.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause,
unless otherwise required by Law, the articles of incorporation and code of
regulations or similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification and advancement of expenses than are set forth
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the Company's constituent documents
and/or available under applicable Law, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

(d) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies or purchase
or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy" with reputable
insurers, in each case of at least the same coverage and scope, and in
amounts, and containing terms and conditions, that are no less favorable to
such individuals than such policy in effect on the date hereof, with respect
to service, acts or omissions arising on or before the Effective Time,
including the Transactions, except that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies an annual premium that is more than 300% of the annual premium
payable by the Company for such insurance for the fiscal year ending November
30, 2018 (the "Maximum Amount"); provided, that if the annual premium payable
by Parent for such policies at any time exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy or policies that, in its good
faith determination, provide the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Amount. The Company may prior to the Effective Time
purchase a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing at
least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to service, acts or omissions existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time,



-53-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





including the Transactions, except that in no event shall the Company pay with
respect to such "tail policy" more than the Maximum Amount. If such prepaid
"tail policy" has been obtained by the Company, it will be deemed to satisfy
all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.8(d) and the
Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to
honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 will survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the
Company's constituent documents, by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.8 (and the "tail
policy" obtained pursuant thereto) may not be terminated, canceled or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.8 applies unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.8 applies will be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8).

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, Parent
shall make or cause to be made proper provision so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume and
perform the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

Section 6.9 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall cause Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement before and after the Effective Time, as applicable (including, with
respect to Merger Sub, to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement).

Section 6.10 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, the Company and the Company
Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as may be reasonably
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; provided, that the foregoing will not require the Company Board to
take any action that could be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

Section 6.11 Employee Matters.

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending at the end of
the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each



-54-

employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Employee") who
continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries after the Effective Time with (i) salary, wage
and annual cash bonus opportunity that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than the salary, wage and annual cash bonus opportunity that were provided to
such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time (provided that
such Company Employee's salary or wage shall be no less than such Company
Employee's salary or wage immediately prior to the Effective Time), and (ii)
employee retirement, welfare and other benefits (excluding any equity based
compensation and change of control, retention or other one-time awards) that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than such employee retirement, welfare
and other benefits provided to each such Company Employee immediately before
the Effective Time. For the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each eligible Company Employee who suffers a
qualifying termination of employment, severance benefits in accordance with
Section 6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (taking into account such
Company Employee's service as required pursuant to Section 6.11(b) below, to
the extent applicable). In addition, during the Continuation Period (in
calendar year 2020 and, if the Effective Time occurs in calendar year 2020, in
calendar year 2021), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
each Company Employee who remains employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation at such time as annual long-term incentive awards are made by
Parent to other eligible Company Employees in calendar year 2020 and, if
applicable, in calendar year 2021, annual cash- or equity-based long term
incentive award opportunities with, in the case of such award opportunities in
calendar year 2020 and, if applicable, in calendar year 2021, a value that is
no less favorable than the ordinary course annual equity incentive opportunity
provided by the Company to such Company Employee in 2019, with substantially
similar other terms as adjusted in a manner consistent with Parent's long-term
incentive programs. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
with respect to any Company Employees who are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement or who are based outside of the United States, Parent's
obligations under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to, and not in
contravention of, any obligations under any such applicable collective
bargaining agreement or under the Laws of the foreign countries and political
subdivisions thereof in which such Company Employees are based.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, level of benefits and
benefit accruals under any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries in which participation is offered to Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries or
predecessors before the Effective Time, to at least the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar employee benefit plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any
waiting periods to be waived for each Company Employee under any New Plan. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes
of any New Plan providing welfare benefits, Parent shall



-55-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





use reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing condition limitations or
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Company Employee and his or her spouse and covered dependents, and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Company Employee and his or her spouse and covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of any corresponding Company Plan ending on the date
such Company Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her spouse and covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to,
credit each Company Employee with the accrued and unused vacation, personal
and sickness days to which such Company Employee is entitled through the
Effective Time.

(c) To the extent any bonus amounts ("Bonus Amounts") under any cash bonus,
sales and other incentive plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to a performance period completed prior to the Effective Time remain
unpaid as of the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall cause all such Bonus Amounts to be calculated and paid in
the ordinary course of business to the eligible employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
cause all Bonus Amounts with respect to the performance period in which the
Closing occurs to be calculated and paid to the eligible employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Such Bonus Amounts shall be calculated at the
achieved level of performance determined by Parent for the entire performance
period, and such Bonus Amounts shall be paid at the ordinary time such bonuses
are paid under the applicable plan; provided, that payment of any Bonus
Amounts in accordance with this Section 6.11(c) shall in no way be interpreted
or construed to limit or replace any amounts to which a Company Employee may
be entitled pursuant to a Company Plan in connection with such Company
Employee's termination of employment or services; provided, further, that with
respect to any Bonus Amounts that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made
at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such cash bonus, sales or
other incentive plan that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Bonus Amounts,
the applicable cash bonus, sales and other incentive plans of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be operated and administered consistent with the terms
of such plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and with
the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including, without
limitation, with respect to the determination of achieved performance levels
and the timing of when earned Bonus Amounts are paid).

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.11 shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or as prohibiting or limiting the
ability of Parent to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies,
arrangements, agreements or understandings of the Company or Parent. Parent
and the Company acknowledge the provisions of this Section 6.11 are binding
upon and are solely for the



-56-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this
Section 6.11, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Participant), or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any
third-party beneficiary rights, right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement.

(e) Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that a "change of
control" (or equivalent phrase) within the meaning of the Company Plans will
occur at the Effective Time, as applicable, for purposes of all Company Plans
for which the term is relevant.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, following the Effective Time, the Deferred
Compensation Plans shall be administered in accordance with their terms.

Section 6.12 Company ESPP. The Company shall ensure that (a) no new offering
periods under the Company ESPP will commence during the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, (b) there will be no increase in
the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made by the participants
under the Company ESPP during the current offering periods, except those made
in accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of the
date of this Agreement and (c) no individuals shall commence participation in
the Company ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time. To the extent applicable, no later than 5 days prior to the
Effective Time, in the case of any outstanding purchase rights under the
Company ESPP, any then-current offering period under the Company ESPP shall
end and each participant's accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP. Shares of Company Common Stock held in participants' Company
ESPP account balances immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated
the same as all other shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.1. The Company shall ensure that the Company ESPP shall terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing.

Section 6.13 Parent Approval. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall cause the sole stockholder of Merger Sub to adopt this
Agreement in its capacity as such in accordance with applicable Law and the
articles of incorporation and code of regulations of Merger Sub. Promptly
following such adoption, Parent shall provide a copy of such written consent
to the Company.

Section 6.14 Shareholder Litigation. The parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate and consult with one another in connection with any shareholder
litigation against any of them or any of their respective directors or
officers with respect to the Transactions, including by promptly advising the
other party of the commencement of any such shareholder litigation, provided
that the Company will control (and give Parent the opportunity to consult in)
any such litigation in which any of the Company's directors or officers is a
named defendant, and Parent will control (and give the Company the opportunity
to consult in) any such litigation in which any of Parent's directors or
officers



-57-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





is a named defendant; provided, further, that the Company shall give Parent
the opportunity, at Parent's cost and expense, to participate in the defense
or settlement of any such shareholder litigation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except as set forth on Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company shall not settle any shareholder litigation against the
Company or any of its directors or officers with respect to the Transactions
without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 6.15 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company and, following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the
applicable rules and policies of NYSE to cause (a) the delisting of the
Company and of the shares of Company Common Stock from NYSE as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and (b) the deregistration of the shares
of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable

dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect thereto) by each director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

Section 6.17 Financing.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the
Financing Agreements, including using reasonable best efforts to satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions in the Financing Agreements to the extent such
conditions are within the control of Parent.

(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt (and in any event within two Business
Days) written notice (i) of any material breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to result in a material breach or default) by any party
to the Financing Agreements of which Parent has Knowledge, (ii) of the receipt
of any notice or other communication from any Financing Source with respect to
any (A) actual or potential material breach or default or termination,
cancellation, acceleration or repudiation of the Financing Agreements or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing
Agreements and (iii) of the occurrence of any event, development, circumstance
or change that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of
Parent to obtain the Financing.

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in any Financing Agreement, Parent shall, without
limiting the obligations of Parent set forth in the immediately following
sentence, (i) notify the Company in writing thereof and (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain, and negotiate and enter into a new
financing agreement that provides for, alternative



-58-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





financing, including from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient to pay
the Required Amount ("Alternative Financing") as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. If obtained, Parent shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of the new financing agreement and the
related fee letter(s) (which may be redacted in a customary manner) promptly
after execution thereof. The provisions of this Section 6.17 and Section 6.18
shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes of
this Section 6.17 and Section 6.18, (A) all references to the Financing shall
be deemed to include such Alternative Financing, (B) all references to any
Financing Agreements shall include the applicable documents for the
Alternative Financing and (C) all references to the Financing Sources shall
include the Persons providing or arranging the Alternative Financing.

(d) Parent shall not, and shall cause its applicable controlled Affiliates
(including Merger Sub) not to, permit, without the prior written consent of
the Company, any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
termination, rescission, cancellation, acceleration or withdrawal of, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, or assignment by Parent or its
Affiliates of, any Financing Agreement or any mandate letter or fee letter
delivered as a condition precedent thereto if any such amendment,
modification, waiver or assignment would (individually or in the aggregate
with any other amendments, modifications, waivers or assignments) (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of proceeds from the Financing below the Required Amount,
(ii) impose any new or additional conditions or contingencies, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any condition precedent to the receipt of the
Financing in any respect that would reasonably be expected to materially delay
or cause the Financing to be unavailable to pay the Required Amount when due
or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against
any other party to any Financing Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver true
and complete copies of any such material amendment, modification or waiver of
any Financing Agreement to the Company (redacted as necessary to address
reasonable confidentiality concerns but only to the extent that any such
redaction is not directly or indirectly in respect of any provision that
relates to the conditionality of the Financing or the terms on which the
Financing will be made available or can be obtained or drawn down). Parent
will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment and other fees
arising pursuant to any Financing Agreement as and when they become due.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall have the right
to reduce or terminate the commitments under the Financing Agreements by an
amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds from
consummated offerings or other incurrences of debt or equity of Parent and/or
its Subsidiaries consummated after the date hereof for which such proceeds
have been irrevocably received by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries after the
date hereof, which proceeds are not subject to recall, cancellation or
repayment before the time when Parent is required to pay the Required Amount
pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to the obligation
of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Transactions.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company

efforts to cause its Affiliates and each of its and their respective
Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to, provide all customary
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with satisfying any
conditions to the Financing set out in Part II of Schedule 2 of the Financing
Agreements and syndicating the Financing, including but not limited to using
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause appropriate officers and employees of the
Company to (A) be available, on a customary basis and on reasonable advance
notice, to meet with prospective lenders, rating agencies and investors in
meetings, presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions (including one-
on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchaser of, the Financing and members of senior
management and other Representatives of the Company) and (B) provide
reasonable and timely assistance with the preparation of business projections,
rating agency presentations and similar materials, (ii) otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and the Financing Sources for
any of the Financing, (iii) furnish Parent with timely financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements, in each
case, to the extent customary and reasonably required pursuant to the
Financing and to the extent reasonably available and in the possession of the
Company, (iv) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, assist Parent
(including by participating in drafting sessions) in the timely preparation of
offering or similar marketing documents required for the syndication of any of
the Financing or any other alternative to all or any portion thereof, (v)
provide customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing
the distribution of information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to prospective lenders or investors (including customary 10b-5 and material
non-public information representations) and (vi) furnishing Parent and the
Financing Sources promptly, and in any event no later than three Business Days
prior to Closing, with all customary documentation and information reasonably
requested at least ten Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date in
connection with such Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and the CDD
Rule. Subject to the indemnity rights set forth herein, the Company consents
to the reasonable use of the Company's logos in connection with any Financing
in a manner customary for such financing transactions, provided that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Affiliates or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
products, services, offerings or Intellectual Property Rights.

(b) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver customary letters, terminations and
releases related to the payoff, satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance of
any existing Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries set forth on
Section 6.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Debt Payoffs"); provided
that any such action



-60-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





described above shall not be required unless it can be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to and to cause
their respective representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with any Debt Payoff.

(c) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with any
Financing that is the subject of this Section 6.18 (including any action taken
in accordance with this Section 6.18) and any information utilized, or the use
or misuse of any Intellectual Property Rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in connection therewith. Parent shall promptly, upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for any cost, liability or expense incurred
by the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Company's
cooperation pursuant to this Section 6.18. Additionally, such cooperation
shall only be provided to the extent it is not (i) does not materially impact
the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) a disclosure of any
information to Parent or its Representatives that is reasonably likely to
cause a violation of any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, is reasonably likely to cause a risk of a loss of
attorney-client privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that is
competitively sensitive information (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access in a manner that does not
result in such a violation of a Contract, the loss of attorney-client
privilege or sharing of competitively sensitive information with individuals
that would not be permitted under applicable Law). For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties acknowledge and agree that neither the obtaining of the Financing
as contemplated by Section 6.17 nor the provision of any cooperation or
information contemplated by this Section 6.18 is, or will be, a condition to
effect the Merger.

termination to the other party, if:

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the close of business
(New York City time) on the 9-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(as it may be extended below, the "Outside Date"); provided, that if the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(d) (where the relevant
Law or Order arises from or relates to Antitrust Laws) shall not have been

failure to perform or comply with, any obligation under this Agreement
materially contributed to, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before the Outside Date (including any extensions thereto in accordance
with the terms of this Section 8.1(b)(i)) or (2) to Parent or the Company
during the pendency of any Action by the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, for specific performance of this Agreement;

(ii) (A) any Laws shall be in effect making illegal or otherwise prohibiting

non-appealable Order so as to permit the consummation of the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable); provided that the right to terminate this

issuance of such Order;

perform or comply with, any of the covenants or a failure to be true of any of
the representations or warranties on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, which
breach, failure or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate, (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) and (ii) is not cured within the earlier of (A) the
Outside Date and (B) 30 days following written notice to Parent; provided,
that (1) the Company shall have given Parent written notice, delivered at
least 30 days prior to such termination (or promptly, if such notice is given

condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) and (ii) is not cured
within the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) 30 days following written
notice to the Company; provided, that (1) Parent shall have given the Company
written notice, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination (or
promptly, if such notice is given within 30 days of the Outside Date), stating
Parent's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g)
and the basis for such termination, and (2) Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if Parent is then in

conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than conditions
that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied
or waived, (ii) the Company is prepared to consummate the Closing, and (iii)
Parent fails to consummate the Closing when the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to Section 1.2 (assuming the satisfaction of conditions that are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing).

A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the other
parties specifying with particularity the reason for such termination. If more
than one provision of this Section 8.1 is available to a terminating party in

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, then this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of
any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee or Representative
of such party) to the other party hereto; provided, however, that the
provisions of Section 6.8, the indemnification and reimbursement obligations
of Section 6.18, this Section 8.2, Article IX and Article X hereof and the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such termination;
provided further, however, no party will be relieved or released from
liability for damages arising out of any (i) fraud, (ii) knowing material
breach of any of its representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or (iii) deliberate material breach of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement (it being understood that in any case
the failure of Parent or the Company to effect the Closing when required under
the terms of this Agreement shall constitute a deliberate material breach),
and the aggrieved party will be entitled to all rights and remedies available
at law or in equity. For purposes of this Section 8.2, (A) a "knowing" breach
of a representation and warranty will be deemed to have occurred if the
Company or Parent or Merger Sub had actual Knowledge of such breach as of the
date of this Agreement, and (B) a "deliberate" breach of any covenant or
agreement will be deemed to have occurred if the other party took or failed to
take action with actual Knowledge that the action so taken or omitted to be
taken constituted, or would reasonably be expected to constitute, a breach of
such covenant or agreement. Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that
the individuals specified in the definition of "Knowledge" (1) have reviewed
with counsel the representations, warranties and

covenants contained herein and (2) for purposes of this subsection (a), shall
be deemed to understand the meanings of the representations, warranties and

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or (iii) (x) by either Parent

Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(g) and (y) (A) prior to such termination a
Company Takeover Proposal has been made to the Company, or publicly made,
proposed or communicated or otherwise becomes publicly known, which shall not
have been withdrawn prior to the time the Agreement is terminated and (B) at
any time on or prior to the twelve-month anniversary of such termination the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or the transactions contemplated by a
Company Takeover Proposal are consummated (provided that solely for purposes
of this Section 8.2(b)(iii)(y)(B), the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall
have the meaning set forth in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal
except that all references to 20% shall be deemed references to 50%), the
Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer (to an account
designated by Parent) in immediately available funds (1) in the case of clause

substantially concurrently with such termination or (3) in the case of clause
(iii) of this Section 8.2(b), upon the earlier of entering into such
definitive agreement with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal.
"Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $15,800,000 inclusive of
any irrecoverable VAT chargeable thereon. Without prejudice to, or limitation
of, Parent's rights with respect to claims of fraud or claims of knowing
material breach of any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement
or any deliberate material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, the parties agree that payment of the Termination Fee is
compensation for the cost, resource and opportunity to be committed by Parent
in connection with the Transactions, and from and after such termination and
payment of the Termination Fee as described in this Section 8.2(c), the
Company shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other
than as provided under this Section 8.2(c), Section 8.2(e) and Section 8.2(g).

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e),
Parent shall pay the Company the Reverse Termination Fee by wire transfer (to
an account designated by the Company) in immediately available funds within
two Business Days after such termination. "Reverse Termination Fee" shall mean
a cash amount equal to $15,800,000 inclusive of any irrecoverable VAT
chargeable thereon. Without prejudice to, or limitation of, the Company's
rights with respect to claims of fraud or claims of knowing material breach of
any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement or any deliberate
material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement,
the parties agree that payment of the Reverse Termination Fee is compensation

of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the
termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under this Section
8.2(c), Section 8.2(f) and Section 8.2(g).

(d) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), and at the time of such termination the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(d) shall not have been
satisfied or waived (in the case of Section 7.1(d), if the applicable Law or
Order arises from or relates to Antitrust Laws) but all other conditions set
forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or waived (or in the case of
conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, are
capable of being satisfied as of such date) or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) as a
result of a Law or Order that arises from or relates to Antitrust Laws, Parent
shall pay the Company the Regulatory Termination Fee by wire transfer (to an
account designated by the Company) in immediately available funds within two
Business Days after such termination. "Regulatory Termination Fee" shall mean
a cash amount equal to $15,800,000 inclusive of any irrecoverable VAT
chargeable thereon. Without prejudice to, or limitation of, the Company's
rights with respect to claims of fraud or claims of knowing material breach of
any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement or any deliberate
material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement,
the parties agree that payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee is
compensation for the cost, resource and opportunity to be committed by the
Company in connection with the Transactions, and from and after such
termination and payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee as described in this
Section 8.2(d), Parent and Merger Sub shall have no further liability of any
kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination
contemplated hereby other than as provided under this Section 8.2(d), Section
8.2(f) and Section 8.2(g).

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.2(b)
are integral parts of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to Section
8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences
an Action that results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall
pay to Parent interest on such amount from and including the date payment of
such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime
rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made, together with reasonable legal fees and expenses
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with such Action.

(f) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.2(c) and
Section 8.2(d) are integral parts of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
Parent fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to Section
8.2(c) or Section 8.2(d), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences an Action that results in a judgment against Parent or Merger Sub,
Parent

or Merger Sub shall pay to the Company interest on such amount from and
including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made, together with
reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with
such Action.

(g) The parties agree and understand that (i) in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and in no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee or the Regulatory
Termination Fee on more than one occasion or to pay the Reverse Termination
Fee and the Regulatory Termination Fee, in each case, under any circumstances,
and (ii) except in the case of fraud or claims of knowing material breach of
any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement or any deliberate
material breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement by
the other party, if this Agreement is terminated and such termination is
subject to Section 8.2(b), Section 8.2(c) or Section 8.2(d), as applicable,
then: (A) in no event shall Parent be entitled to receive an amount greater
than the Termination Fee and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to
Section 8.2(e) (such additional amounts, collectively, the "Parent Additional
Amounts"), and in no event shall the Company be entitled to receive an amount
greater than the Reverse Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as
applicable, and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to Section 8.2(f)
(such additional amounts, collectively, the "Company Additional Amounts"), and
(B) if Parent receives the Termination Fee and any applicable Parent
Additional Amounts from the Company, or if the Company receives the Reverse
Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee and any applicable Company
Additional Amounts from Parent, then, in either case, such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party
and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners,
equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives, and none of
the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation, in each case
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company or any Person that
is an Affiliate of the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither the Company nor any Person that is an Affiliate of the

hereunder or thereunder.

affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible and the parties agree that the court making such determination shall
have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

Section 9.8 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) Subject to the second sentence of this Section 9.8(a), this Agreement, and
all claims or causes of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of this
Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction
(except that all claims or causes of action against a Financing Source based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the negotiation of this
Agreement, the performance of this Agreement or the Transactions, including
any dispute arising out of or related to the Financing, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without

principles or rules would require or permit the application of the Laws of
another jurisdiction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the matters contained in
Article I and Article II shall be governed by the OGCL, including matters
relating to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, the effects of the
Merger, dissenters' rights and all determinations as to Dissenting Shares, and
all matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board shall be

without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction.

(b) Any Action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
applicable state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware, or in
the event (but only in the event) such courts do not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, any Federal court within the State of Delaware,
or, if both the Delaware Court of



-73-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





Chancery and the Federal courts within the State of Delaware do not have
subject matter jurisdiction over such Action, any other state court within the
State of Delaware (except that any Action against any Financing Source that is
in any way related to this Agreement or the Transactions, including any Action
based upon, arising out of or related to the Financing, shall be brought in a
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York (or,
only if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York State
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York) (the
"Chosen Courts"), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in any such Action, waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of
forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and
determined only in the Chosen Courts, and agrees not to bring any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any other
court. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final Order in
any Action by a Chosen Court will be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on such Order or in any other matter provided by
applicable Law. Parent hereby appoints Parent US Sub (or such other Person as
notified in writing to the Company) as its agent for service and for any other
documents in proceedings in the United States or for any other proceedings
arising in connection with this Agreement.

Section 9.9 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any of the parties without the prior written consent
of the other parties; provided that Parent and Merger Sub may assign or
delegate their rights, interests and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided, further,
that no such assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing,
Parent may assign all of its rights to payment under this Agreement for
collateral security purposes to any lender providing financing to Parent
pursuant to any Financing Agreement, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent of any liability or obligation hereunder.

Section 9.10 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 8.2 (A) are not
intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result
from a breach of this Agreement



-74-

NAI-1507512591v13

* * *





and (B) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect
any party's right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each
party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate
remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that
any party entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 9.10 shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such injunction and any party against
whom such injunction is entered agrees not to request or demand any bond or
security in connection therewith.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may pursue (i) a grant of specific
performance to the extent permitted by this Section 9.10, (ii) the payment of
damages as contemplated by Section 8.2(a), and (iii) the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee as contemplated by Section 8.2(c); provided that (x)
the Company shall not be entitled or permitted to receive payment under
clauses (ii) and (iii) if specific performance is granted and consummation of
the Transactions occurs and (y) the Company shall not be entitled or permitted
to be granted specific performance for the consummation of the Transactions if
payment under clauses (ii) and/or (iii) is awarded and paid.

Section 9.11 Parent US Sub Guaranty. Parent US Sub hereby absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the prompt and punctual payment of
all amounts that may become due and payable by, and the prompt and punctual
performance of all obligations of, Parent and Merger Sub hereunder in

termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Section 9.12 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THE COMPANY (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES) AND EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION RELATED TO ANY
