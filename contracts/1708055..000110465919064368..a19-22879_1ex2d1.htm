(c) If the Shareholder Representative disagrees with the calculation of the

Company Expenses, it shall notify Parent of such disagreement in writing,
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement and
its calculation of the Closing Date Leakage Amount, Closing Date Indebtedness
and/or Closing Date Company Expenses, as applicable, within thirty (30) days
after its receipt of the Closing Date Statement. In the event that the
Shareholder Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement
within such thirty (30)-day period, the Shareholder Representative shall be
deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Closing Date Leakage Amount, Closing Date Indebtedness and Closing Date
Company Expenses delivered by Parent which shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of
disagreement is timely provided, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or
such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements
with respect to the calculations of the Closing Date Leakage Amount, Closing
Date Indebtedness and/or Closing Date Company Expenses. If, at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then an independent
accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national standing as may
be mutually selected and agreed upon by Parent and the Shareholder
Representative (the " ** _Auditor_** ") shall resolve any disagreements that
were presented in the Shareholder Representatives notice of disagreement and
remain unresolved. Each of Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall
promptly after engagement of the Auditor provide their assertions regarding
the Closing Date Leakage Amount, Closing Date Indebtedness, and/or Closing
Date Company Expenses, as applicable, and, to the extent relevant thereto, the
Closing Balance Sheet in writing to the Auditor and to each other. The Auditor
shall be instructed to render its determination with respect to such
disagreements as soon as reasonably practicable (which Parent and the
Shareholder Representative agree shall not be later than the later of the date
that is forty-five (45) days following the date on which the Auditor is
retained or the date provided in the Auditors engagement letter). The Auditor
shall base its determination solely on (i) the written submissions of Parent
and the Shareholder Representative and shall not conduct an independent
investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which the Closing Date Leakage
Amount, Closing Date Indebtedness, and/or Closing Date Company Expenses
require adjustment (only with respect to the remaining disagreements that were
included in the Shareholder Representatives notice of disagreement and
submitted to the Auditor) in order to be determined in accordance with
_Section 3.7(b)_ (including the definitions of the defined terms used in
_Section 3.7(b)_). The determination of the Auditor for each item of
disagreement submitted to it shall (x) be within the range of values assigned
to such item by Parent and the Shareholder Representative in their respective
written assertions to the Auditor and (y) be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties. The date on which the Closing Date Leakage Amount, Closing Date
Indebtedness, and Closing Date Company Expenses are finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 3.7(c)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " **
_Determination Date_** ". All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne between
Parent, on

 



      

 

 



 

the one hand, and the Shareholder Representative, as a Shareholder Allocable
Expense, on the other, based on the percentage which the portion of the total
contested amounts submitted to the Auditor and not awarded to such party as
determined by the Auditor bears to the total amounts contested by the parties
and submitted to the Auditor.

 



 

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Aggregate Cash

the Surviving Company (for payment to each applicable Optionholder) a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (1) the Adjustment Amount, up to
a maximum of the Escrow Cash Amount, _multiplied by_ (2) the Option

equal to the product of (1) the Price Adjustment Escrow Cash Amount,
_multiplied by_ (2) the Ordinary Shares Percentage, (B) to the Surviving

Neither of Parent and Merger Sub shall be liable, and neither the Company
Equityholders nor the CVR Holders will look to Parent or Merger Sub, to the

Adjustment Amount, _multiplied by_ (2) the Ordinary Shares Percentage, (B) to
the Surviving Company (for payment to each applicable Company Equityholder) a

BV (for payment to each CVR Holder) a cash payment in an amount equal to the
product of (1) the excess (if any) of the Price Adjustment Escrow Cash Amount
over the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, _multiplied by_ (2) the CVR
Percentage.

 



 

No Company Equityholder or CVR Holder shall be liable, and Parent and Merger
Sub will not look to any Company Equityholder or CVR Holder, to the extent the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount exceeds the Escrow Cash Amount.

Amount is a positive number, then the Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be
increased by the Sale Property Taxes Adjustment Amount and the Sale Property

the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders and the
CVR Holders) and Parent shall each, within three (3) Business Days after the

absolute value of the Sale Property Taxes Adjustment Amount exceeds the Sale
Property Taxes Escrow Cash Amount or the funds remaining in the Adjustment
Escrow Account after giving effect to any payment pursuant to Section 3.7(f))

potential future obligations of the Shareholder Representative and/or of the
Company Equityholders to the Shareholder Representative, including expenses of
the Shareholder Representative arising from the defense or enforcement of
claims pursuant to _Section 3.7_ and _Section 10.16_.

 



 

Section 3.13 _Withholdings_.

 



 

(a) Parent, the Surviving Company, ECI BV, the Israeli Company Options Trustee
or the Paying Agent (and, in each case, any of their Affiliates and
Representatives) (each, a " ** _Payor_** ") shall be entitled to deduct or
withhold from any amounts payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
amounts deliverable in respect of the Aggregate Stock Consideration) such
amounts as Parent or any other Payor shall reasonably determine are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the ITO or any other provision of applicable Tax Law; _provided_ , that any
Payor intending to so withhold shall use good faith efforts to provide
reasonable advance notice to the Shareholder Representative and to provide
reasonable cooperation to the Shareholder Representatives attempt to reduce
or eliminate any such deductions or withholding. To the extent that amounts
are required by law to be withheld or deducted and are paid over to the
appropriate Tax Authority by Payor, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Payor.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section _ 3.13(c)_, if a Company Equityholder other than a
holder of Israeli Company Options provides the applicable Payor, no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date of such payment with
a valid certificate, ruling or any other written instructions regarding Tax
withholding issued by the ITA in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Parent, confirming exemption from, or reduced, withholding of Israeli Tax
in respect of a payment (a " ** _Valid Certificate_** "), then the applicable
Payor shall withhold or deduct the applicable amount of Israeli Tax (if any)
from such payment in accordance with such Valid Certificate. For the avoidance
of doubt, to the extent that the Exchange Fund allocated to any Company
Equityholder does not contain sufficient cash to pay any required withholding
of Israeli Tax, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to sell Parent Common Stock
in the Exchange Fund allocated to such Company Equityholder in order to obtain
the required cash amount.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to _Section 3.13(e)_, payments
hereunder to be made to Company Equityholders (other than for Israeli Company
Options) shall be transferred to the Paying Agent without any withholdings or
deductions of Israeli Taxes and retained by the

 



     

 

 



 

Paying Agent or an affiliate thereof for future payment to the recipient
entitled to payment for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following
the Closing Date or, in each case, such an earlier date requested in writing
by such recipient (the " ** _Withholding Drop Date_** ") during which time no
payments shall be made by the Paying Agent to any payment recipient and no
amounts for Israeli Taxes shall be withheld from the payments deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement, and during which time such Person may seek to
obtain a Valid Certificate. If such Person delivers such Valid Certificate to
the Paying Agent no later than five (5) business days prior to the Withholding
Drop Date, the Paying Agent shall deduct and withhold any Israeli Taxes from
the relevant payment in accordance with the provisions of such Valid
Certificate and the balance of any such payment owing to such Person at the
Closing shall be paid to such Person. If any Person (i) does not provide the
Paying Agent with such Valid Certificate by no later than five (5) business
days before the Withholding Drop Date or (ii) submits a written request to the
Paying Agent to release the payment to be made to such Person at the Closing
prior to the Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a Withholding
Certificate for such payment at or before such time, then the amount to be
withheld from such Persons payment shall be calculated according to the
applicable withholding rate as reasonably determined by the Parent and in
accordance with the applicable Law who shall pay to such Person the balance of
the payment due to such Person that is not so withheld. In addition to
whatever withholding is required by Law, the Paying Agent or any Payor shall
be entitled to withhold (without gross-up) from any cash or Parent Common
Stock otherwise payable to the Company Equityholders any Losses that are
incurred by any Payor as a result of the delay in payment and withholding
contemplated by this Section 3.13(c) (including any incremental interest,
penalties, or other amounts that are required to be remitted to a Governmental
Authority as a result of the delay in remitting any withholding Taxes), and
such amounts shall be remitted to the applicable Payor.

 



 

(d) Any withholding made in NIS with respect to payments made hereunder in
dollars shall be calculated based on a conversion rate on the date the payment
is actually made to any recipient.

 



 

(e) It being understood that the parties to this Agreement intend to comply
with Income Tax Circular 19/2018 (Transaction for Sale of Rights in a
Corporation that includes Consideration that will be transferred to the Seller
at Future Dates) (the " ** _Circular_** ") such that the deposit of the
consideration funds with the applicable Payor, including pursuant to _Section
3.13(c)_, shall be exempt from Israeli tax withholding by the Parent, the
Direct Parent and the Merger Sub, _provided_ , that if prior to the Closing
Date the Paying Agent does not undertake to comply with _Section 6.24_ of the
Circular with respect to Israeli Tax, the Shareholder Representative shall
provide the Parent with a Valid Certificate with respect to the deposit of the
consideration funds with the applicable Payor. If any such Valid Certificate
is not provided by the Shareholder Representative prior to the Closing Date,
then the deposit of the consideration with the applicable Payor will be
subject to deduction or withholding of Israeli Taxes in accordance with
_Section 3.13(a)_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any payments to be made
to a holder of Israeli Company Options will be transferred by the applicable
Payor to the Israeli Company Options Trustee, such transfer shall be made
without any withholdings or deductions of Israeli to the extent that the
Shareholder Representative provides Parent with the Option Tax Ruling prior to
the Closing Date, and shall be subject to deduction and withholding of Israeli
Tax by the Israeli Company Options Trustee in accordance with the ITO and the
Option Tax Ruling. If the Option Tax Ruling is not provided by the Shareholder
Representative prior to the Closing Date, then the deposit of the
consideration with the Israeli Company Option Trustee will be subject to
deduction or withholding of Israeli Taxes in accordance _Section 3.13(a)_.

 



 

Section 3.14 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
registration of transfers on the share

 



     

 

 



 

transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Company of Company Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If physical
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company or Parent for transfer
following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the
applicable Per Share Consideration, as provided for in _Section_ _ 3.1(b)_,
for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificates.

 



 

Section 3.15 _Payment Schedule_. The Shareholder Representative shall confirm
the Payment Schedule prior to any payment pursuant to this Agreement. Any
determination of the Payment Schedule by the Shareholder Representative shall
be final and binding on all Company Equityholders (other than Pathfinder).
None of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or the Paying Agent
shall be responsible for, and the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of all
of the Company Equityholders) hereby releases Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates from any and all damages or losses arising out of or in
connection with, the allocation of any payments by the Shareholder
Representative as set forth in the Payment Schedule, including any claim by a
Company Equityholder in relation to payments made by any Person in accordance
with the Payment Schedule. _Section_ _ 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth an illustrative example of the Payment Schedule, prepared in
accordance with the Governing Documents of the Company and applicable Law to
reflect the allocation and distribution of all amounts payable to the holders
of Company Shares, Optionholders and CVR Holders. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Closing Payments payable
by Parent pursuant to the Payment Schedule exceed the Estimated Aggregate Cash
Consideration and the Aggregate Stock Consideration _minus_ the Escrow Stock
Amount.

 



 

Section 3.16 _ECI Loan; Pathfinder Preferred_. At the Effective Time, (i) the
Parent shall cause RCOCI to lend to the Company a portion of the Cash
Consideration (the " ** _ECI Loan_** ") in the amount sufficient to make the
payments pursuant to this _Section 3.16_ and (ii) the Company shall use the
proceeds of the ECI Loan to pay to Pathfinder an amount equal to the
Pathfinder Preferred Liquidation Preference in consideration for the transfer
from Pathfinder to the Company, as of the Effective Time, of all of the shares
of the Pathfinder Preferred outstanding as of the Closing pursuant to the
Pathfinder SPA. The amounts payable to Pathfinder pursuant to this _Section
3.16_ may be paid by the Company through the Paying Agent as part of the
Exchange Fund.

 



 

Section 3.17 _ECI BV Redemption_. Immediately following the consummation of
the transactions set forth in Section 3.16, Parent shall cause ECI BV to
redeem, for no consideration, all of the shares of ECI BV held by ECI Telecom
LTD. at such time.

Financial Statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of
Parent has disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the
Parent Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability
to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal control over financial reporting, in each case, that was
disclosed

 



     

 

 



 

to Parents auditors or the audit committee of the Parent Board in connection
with its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting
prior to the date hereof.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. From the Balance Sheet Date to the

Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the
Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past practice, and (b) none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that if taken after the

Agreement. None of Parent or its Subsidiaries has current plans to initiate

Permit in any material respect.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Compliance with Laws_.

actual or potential noncompliance with any of the foregoing, in each case,
except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its

Section 5.14 _Material Contracts_. Except for breaches, violations or defaults
which would not be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of or default under the terms of
any Parent Material Contract, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no other party

any material Contract. Each Parent Material Contract is a valid and binding
obligation of Parent or Merger Sub (as applicable) and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, of each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, subject
to the Remedies Exceptions. Except for completions or expirations of Contracts
in accordance with their terms, as of the date hereof, no customer or supplier
under a Parent Material Contract has notified Parent or any of its

Section 5.16 _Information Supplied_. The Proxy Statement shall not, at the
time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the shareholders of Parent and at
the time of any meeting of Parents shareholders to be held in connection with
the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by
Parent with respect to statements made (or incorporated by reference) therein
based on information supplied by any of the Company or its Representatives for
inclusion (or incorporated by reference) therein.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Brokers_. Other than the financial advisor identified in

financial advisor is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Merger and any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Financing Activities_. Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to
the Company a true and complete copy of the executed debt commitment letter
and the related Fee Letter, dated as of the date hereof (including all
exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto and together with the related Fee
Letter, the " ** _Debt Commitment Letter_** ") from the Financing Sources;
_provided_ , _however_ , that solely in the case of the Fee Letter, a true and
complete copy has been delivered to the Company with redactions of only the
fee amounts payable on the Closing Date to a Financing Source and of the
amounts by which interest rates or original issue discount (" ** _OID_** ")
may change; _provided further_ , that no redactions have been made of terms
that could affect the availability of, or conditionality applicable to the
funding of, the Debt Financing or reduce the net proceeds thereof to an
amount, when combined with other funds available to Parent and Merger Sub at
Closing, less than the amount necessary to pay the Required Payment Amount. As
of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified in any manner. None

 



     

 

 



 

of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has entered into
any Contract, side letter or other arrangement or understanding relating to
the financing of the Required Payment Amount or transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that could affect the amount of, availability of, or conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, other
than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The commitments contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents
a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and (to the
Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub) each other party thereto, including to
negotiate the Debt Financing Documents in good faith with respect to the
financing contemplated thereby, subject to the Remedies Exception. Parent has
fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other
amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any other party thereto under the Debt
Commitment Letter. None of Parent or Merger Sub has any reason to believe that
it or (to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub) any other party thereto will
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Debt Commitment Letter.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than the Financing
Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date shall be the Financing
Conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent and Merger Sub have
no reason to believe, subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent that
set forth obligations of the Company, as set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_, and assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement and the performance by the Company of
its obligations hereunder, that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not
be satisfied or (ii) the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent
and Merger Sub on the Closing Date. When funded in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, including
any "market flex" provisions with respect thereto, and together with other
funds available to Parent and Merger Sub at Closing, the Debt Financing will
provide Parent and Merger Sub with acquisition financing on the Closing Date
sufficient to pay the Required Payment Amount on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each party hereto agrees that a breach of this representation and warranty
shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to Companys and
Shareholder Representatives obligations under this Agreement, if
(notwithstanding such breach) Parent and Merger Sub are willing and able to
consummate the Merger on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, as of the date
hereof, they and their Representatives (a) have received full access to (i)
such books and records, facilities, properties, premises, equipment, contracts
and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries which they and their
Representatives have requested to review and (ii) the Electronic Data Room and
(b) have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and to discuss the business and assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_
and in certifications delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and the
representations of the Parent Significant Stockholders or the Company
Significant Stockholder in the Voting Agreements, (a) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries makes, or has made, any representation or warranty
relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger
and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty
except for those expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and in certifications
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and the representations of the Parent
Significant Stockholders and Shareholder Representative in the Voting
Agreements and the letter of transmittal (including any certificates delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto), (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to
itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if
made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or
Merger Sub as having been authorized by such entity and (c) any estimate,
projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum,

 



     

 

 



 

presentation or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives, including any materials or
information made available in the Electronic Data Room, via confidential
memorandum, in connection with presentations by the Companys management or
otherwise, are not and shall not be deemed to be or include representations or
warranties unless and to the extent any such materials or information is the
subject of any express representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own
independent review and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition,
operations and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied on
the results of its own independent review and analysis. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall affect the
ability of Parent to bring claims for Fraud.

 



 

Section 5.20 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _Article V_ and in
certifications delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and the representations
of the Parent Significant Stockholders or the Company Significant Stockholder
in the Voting Agreements, none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person on behalf of Parent makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or with respect to any
other information provided, or made available, the Company or its
Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the accuracy or completeness thereof. Without limiting the
foregoing, and other than in the case of Fraud, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
any other Person will have or be subject to any Liability or other obligation
to the Company or its Representatives or Affiliates or any other Person
resulting from the Companys or its Representatives or Affiliates use of any
information, documents, projections, forecasts, financial model of other
material made available to the Company or its Representatives or Affiliates,
including any information made available in the electronic data room for
maintained by Parent for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, teaser, marketing material, confidential information memorandum,
management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions, responses to
questions submitted on behalf of the Company or its Representatives or in any
other form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
unless and to the extent any such information is expressly included in a
representation or warranty contained in this _Article V_ or in certifications
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and the representations of the Parent
Significant Stockholders or the Company Significant Stockholder in the Voting
Agreements.

(v) any combination of the foregoing.

cause their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing

heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement that relates to a Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than Parent) to return or destroy all confidential
information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries heretofore furnished to
such third party by Parent or on its behalf. The Company agrees that it and
its Subsidiaries will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section
6.3_.

 



 

Section 6.4 _No Solicitation by Parent_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.4_ , from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent will not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, (a)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, directly or indirectly, the making
of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (b) other than informing Third Parties
of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.4_ , engage in negotiations or
substantive discussions with, or furnish any material nonpublic information
to, any Third Party that may relate to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Parent Acquisition Proposal_** " shall mean,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any bona fide
proposal or offer (other than a proposal or offer by the Company or any of its
Affiliates) from a Third Party for (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination transaction
involving Parent or involving any of its Subsidiaries representing, directly
or indirectly, greater than twenty percent (20%) of any of the assets, net
revenues or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than any merger involving
Parent and one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries where Parent is the
surviving corporation in the merger, or any liquidation of a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent), (ii) the acquisition by any Person of twenty percent
(20%) or more of any of the assets, net revenues or earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole or (iii) the acquisition by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more

(20%) or more of the issued and outstanding capital stock of any of its
Subsidiaries representing, directly or indirectly, greater than twenty percent
(20%) of any of the assets, net revenues or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section _6.4(c)_ through _Section 6.4(h)_ , prior to the
Closing Date, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall,
directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify, or publicly
propose to withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to the
Company, the Parent Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) in the event of the commencement of a tender offer or exchange
offer for any outstanding shares of Parents capital stock, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the holders of
Parent Common Stock (including, subject to _Section 6.4(c)_ , by taking no
position or a neutral position with respect to any such offer) within ten
Business Days of the commencement thereof, (iv) recommend that the Parent
stockholders not approve the Share Issuance (any action described in clauses
(i)-(iv) above being referred to as an " ** _Parent Change of
Recommendation_** "), (v) either fail to enforce, or grant any waiver or
release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of equity securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries unless the Parent
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws, (vi) approve any transaction under, or any
Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under, _Article IX_ of the
Parents Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or (vii) enter into
any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating
to a Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Parent or the Parent
Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under Rule 14d-9 and
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position (none of which, in and of itself,
shall be deemed to constitute a Parent Change of Recommendation") or (ii)
making any disclosure to Parents stockholders if the Parent Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties or Law; provided that any such disclosure may constitute a Parent
Change of Recommendation in accordance with the definition thereof.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) any factually
accurate public statement by Parent that describes Parents receipt of a
Parent Acquisition Proposal and the provisions and obligations in this
Agreement with respect thereto, shall not be deemed to be a recommendation of
such Parent Acquisition Proposal or a Parent Change of Recommendation and (ii)
Parent may inform any Person of the existence of its obligations under the
provisions of this _Section 6.4_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ _6.4(a)_ and
_Section 6.4(_ _b)_ , until the earlier of the receipt of the Requisite Parent
Stockholder Approval and any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article_ _VIII_ , if after the date of this Agreement Parent receives a
written _bona fide_ Parent Acquisition Proposal, that was not, directly or
indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of this
_Section_ _6.4_ , and that the Parent Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (i)
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Superior Proposal, then Parent, its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives may, subject to _Section_ _6.4(h)_ , in
response to such Parent Acquisition Proposal take the following actions, to
the extent that the Parent Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Parents
stockholders under Law: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party
making such Parent Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to furnishing
such information, Parent receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement with provisions no less restrictive to such third
party with respect to the use or disclosure of nonpublic information than the
Confidentiality Agreement and expressly allow Parent to comply with its
obligations under this _Section 6.4_ (B) engage in discussions or negotiations
with the third party with respect to such Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.4_ , nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Parent or the Parent Board from, at any time prior to, but not after,
the receipt of the Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to the
receipt of a written Parent Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_ , effecting
a Parent Change of Recommendation, if and only if, prior to taking such
action, (i) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Parent Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and (ii)(A) the Company shall
have received written notice (the " ** _Parent Superior Proposal Notice_** ")
of Parents or of the Parent Board, as applicable, intention to take such
action at least four (4) Business Days prior to the taking of such action by
Parent or the Parent Board, as applicable, which notice shall include the
information with respect to such Parent Acquisition Proposal that is specified
in _Section 6.4(h)_ (to the extent not previously provided), (B) during the
four (4) Business Days following the receipt by the Company of the Parent
Superior Proposal Notice (the " ** _Negotiation Period_** "), Parent, if
requested by the Company, shall have made its Representatives available to
negotiate with the Company regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions proposed by the Company in response to such Parent Acquisition
Proposal, and (C) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period described in
the foregoing clause (B) the Parent Board continues to believe, in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and
after taking into account any modifications to the terms of the Transactions
that are proposed in a written offer by the Company after its receipt of the
Parent Superior Proposal Notice, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal and that failure to take

 



     

 

 



 

such action would be inconsistent with the Parent directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Any material amendment or modification to such Parent
Acquisition Proposal prior to a Parent Change of Recommendation shall require
a new Parent Superior Proposal Notice and the Negotiation Period shall be
extended by an additional two (2) Business Days from the date of receipt of
such new Parent Superior Proposal Notice.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Parent Board from, at any time
prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Requisite Parent Stockholder
Approval, effecting a Parent Change of Recommendation (other than in response
to the receipt or making of a Parent Acquisition Proposal, which shall be
subject to _Section 6.4(e)_ ) if the Parent Board determines that an
Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and if, (i) prior to taking
such action, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Parent directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however that Parent shall send to the Company written notice of the
Parent Boards intention to take any such action at least four (4) Business
Days prior to the taking of such action by the Parent Board, specifying in
reasonable detail the circumstances related to such determination, (ii) during
such notice period, Parent, if requested by the Company, shall have made
available its Representatives to negotiate with the Company to revise the
terms of the this Agreement and (iii) the Parent Board continues to believe,
after taking into account any modifications to the terms of the Agreement that
are proposed by the Company in a written offer after its receipt of such
notice, that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with the Parent
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Parent agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall, and that they shall
cause their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
person (other than the parties) conducted prior to the date of this Agreement
with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal and (ii) request each third
party that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement that relates to
a Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than the Company) to return or destroy
all confidential information regarding Parent or its Subsidiaries heretofore
furnished to such third party by Parent or on its behalf. Parent agrees that
it and its Subsidiaries will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its
and its Subsidiaries Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section 6.4_.

 



 

(h) Parent shall promptly notify the Company orally and in writing of any
request for information or any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such person making such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and Parent shall
provide to the Company written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer
within 24 hours of such event and copies of any written or electronic
correspondence to or from any person making a Parent Acquisition Proposal (or
its Representatives). Parent shall keep the Company informed orally and in
writing, as soon as is reasonably practicable, of the status of any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the status and material terms
of any such proposal or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been
withdrawn or rejected and Parent shall provide to the Company written notice
of any such withdrawal or rejection and copies of any written proposals or
requests for information within 24 hours. Parent also agrees to provide any
information to the Company (not previously provided or made available to the
Company) that it is providing to another person pursuant to this _Section 6.4_
at substantially the same time it provides such information to such other
person. All information provided to the Company under this _Section 6.4_ shall
be kept confidential by the Company in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any breach of this _Section 6.4_
by a Representative of Parent shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
6.4_ by Parent.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 6.5 _SEC Filings; Parent Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, it being
understood that Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file the Proxy
Statement within thirty (30) days after the date hereof and in any event shall
file the Proxy Statement with the SEC no later than forty-five (45) days after
the date hereof. The Company shall provide to Parent all information relating
to the Company that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement. Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to comments from the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. The Proxy Statement
shall not incorporate by reference any information from any other filing made
with the SEC prior to the date the Proxy Statement is distributed to holders
of Parent Common Stock. Parent will cause the Proxy Statement to be
distributed to the holders of Parent Common Stock as soon as reasonably
practicable, and in any event within five (5) days, after (i) the date that is
ten calendar days after the initial Proxy Statement is filed, if the SEC has
not indicated by such date that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or
(ii) otherwise, the date the SEC indicates it has no further comments to the
Proxy Statement (the " ** _Proxy Clearance Date_** "). Parent shall also take
any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Company Shares, or holders of a beneficial interest
therein, as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such
action. No filing or distribution of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement will be made by Parent without the Companys prior consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without
providing the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
(which comments shall be considered by the other party in good faith);
_provided_ , however, that, with respect to documents filed by a party that
are incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement, this right of consent
shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party and
its Affiliates, their business, financial condition or results of operations
or the transactions contemplated hereby, and _provided,_ further, that Parent,
in connection with any Parent Change of Recommendation, may amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference) and
may make other filings with the SEC, to effect such Parent Change of
Recommendation, and in such event, this right of consent shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the Company and its Affiliates or their
business, financial condition or results of operations.

 



 

(b) Parent shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement and advise the Company of any
oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall
provide to Parent all information relating to the Company that is required to
respond to such comments. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include a misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein (in light of the circumstances under which they were made),
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the holders of Parent Common
Stock.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall set, in consultation with the Company, a record date
for the Parent Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to
Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in respect thereof.

 



     

 

 



 

As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Proxy Clearance Date,
Parent shall duly call and give notice of and convene and hold a meeting of
its shareholders (the " ** _Parent Stockholders Meeting_** ") for the purpose
of seeking the Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval. The Parent Stockholders
Meeting shall occur no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Proxy
Statement is distributed to the holders of Parent Common Stock; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders
Meeting (i) for up to five (5) Business Days, if a quorum has not been
established; (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Parent Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by Parents shareholders prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting; or (iii) if required by applicable Law. In addition,
Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting with the prior
written consent of the Company. Parent agrees that the obligation of Parent to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall
not be limited or otherwise affected by (x) the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to Parent or its shareholders of any Parent
Acquisition Proposal; or (y) any Parent Change of Recommendation. Unless the
Parent Board has effected a Parent Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 6.4_ , (x) the Proxy Statement shall include the Parent Board
Recommendation and (y) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (1)
solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Share
Issuance, and (2) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(d) If, on the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent shall at its election
or upon written request of the Company adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting
until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company,
which date shall not be less than five days nor more than 10 days after the
date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy
solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating
to the Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall not adjourn the
Parent Stockholder Meeting more than one time pursuant to this _Section
6.5(b)_ unless mutually agreed by Parent and the Company.

 



 

Section 6.6 _NASDAQ Listing_. As promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, Parent shall make application to NASDAQ for the listing of the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and use all reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to
be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions
of shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from the Merger by each individual
who will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without limiting the other provisions of this _Section 6.8_ , each of the

actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions

necessary consents, approvals, orders, waivers, and authorizations of, actions
or nonactions by, any Governmental Authority necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with,
and notices to, any Governmental Authorities (including pursuant to the HSR
Act any other applicable Antitrust Law necessary to start any applicable
waiting period) and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval from, or to avoid a suit, action, proceeding or investigation by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no party shall be
required by this Agreement to (x) agree to any divestitures, licenses, hold
separate arrangements or similar matters, including material covenants
affecting business operating practices, except to the extent (and each party
will agree to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or
similar matters, including material covenants affecting business operating
practices, so long as) any such divestitures, licenses, arrangements, matters
or covenants would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and the
Company, taken as a whole or (y) defend or contest any proceeding by a
Governmental Authority which questions the validity or legality of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seeks damages in connection
therewith. Parent will not take any actions that would preclude, impair or
delay the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the general obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under
_Section 6.8(a)_ , Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, and cause their respective Affiliates to promptly take, and,

including _Section 6.1_ the Company and its Affiliates shall be permitted to
take (without affecting any representation, warranty, covenant or condition in
this Agreement), all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining all consents
under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority so
as to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, as promptly as practicable.

following the date hereof) (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make any other appropriate

Antitrust Law, in each case, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing or anything else in this _Section 6.8_ , each party agrees to use
its respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or early
termination of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required
authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law
as soon as practicable.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare

which the parties mutually agree should be made, in each case in

with the Notice, " ** _CFIUS Filings_** ").

 



 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law and not prohibited by applicable
Governmental Authorities and subject to all applicable privileges (including
the attorney client privilege), the parties shall (i) cooperate and coordinate
with the other in the making of the CFIUS Filings and in connection with
resolving any investigation, request or other inquiry of CFIUS (including, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, providing copies, or portions thereof,
of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing, except for
any exhibits providing the personal identifier information required by 31
C.F.R § 800.402(c)(6)(vi), and considering all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested in connection therewith), (ii) supply the other with any

a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party to this Agreement shall be
required to agree to any term or take or omit to take any action in connection
with the CFIUS Approval that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(h) Each of Parent and the Company shall be responsible for 50% of all filing

Section 6.9 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1_ , subject to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon
advice of counsel, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide to Parent and its authorized Representatives (a) reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice from Parent to
their respective properties, books, contracts and records as Parent may
reasonably request (provided that Parent and its authorized Representatives
shall not conduct or cause to be conducted any sampling, testing or other
invasive investigation of the air, soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater,
building materials or other environmental media at any real property or
facility owned, leased or operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries) and (b)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide
access to, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or disclose (i) any
information or documents which would (in the reasonable judgment of the
Company) be reasonably likely to (A) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client or other privilege held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B)
violate any applicable Laws, or (C) unreasonably disrupt the businesses and
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) if the Company
or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any
information that is reasonably pertinent thereto. All information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality

the Company or its Subsidiaries or other applicable Contract as in effect on

cause the Governing Documents of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses

Insurance_**"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least seven (7) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys

the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies. The costs payable

effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Company.

notice of Parents intent to take or cause the taking of such action, shall

such action, and shall consider any comments of the Shareholder Representative
with respect to such action in good faith.

pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of this _Section 6.16(e)(ii)_ shall not prevent Parent from taking or causing
another person to take any of the actions enumerated in this section
6.16(e)(ii) to the extent Parent will not make an indemnity claim with respect
to such action.

Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not consummated; (iv) execute and deliver any letter, agreement,
registration statement, document or certificate in connection with the Debt

or take any corporation action, except in each case to the extent (A)
conditioned upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (B) Parent and Merger Sub have determined that the applicable
director, officer or signatory shall continue in such capacity after the
Closing Date; (v) pay any commitment fee or other fee or payment to obtain
consent or incur any liability with respect to or cause or permit any Lien to

(vi) issue on its own behalf any bank information memoranda, high-yield

opinion of counsel in connection with the Debt Financing or (viii) jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege (but the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to grant access to or otherwise disclose information that is subject
to such privilege in a manner which would not jeopardize such privilege). It
is further understood and agreed that any information with respect to the
prospects and plans for the Companys business and operations in connection
with the Debt Financing will be the sole responsibility of Parent and Merger
Sub, and none of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives shall have any liability or be required to provide any
information or make any representations with respect to the capital structure
that will be in effect following the Closing Date, the incurrence of the Debt
Financing, pro forma financial statements, similar pro forma information or

Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing.

 



 

(e) Except to the extent disclosed with the consent of the Company or in
connection with the Debt Financing and subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings with respect thereto (which may include customary "click-through"
confidentiality agreements), all confidential information provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 6.19_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) their obligations to perform their
respective agreements hereunder, including to consummate the Closing subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, are not conditioned on obtaining of the
Debt Financing or any alternative financing or on the performance of any party
to any Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to have complied with their obligations under this _Section 6.19_
for all purposes of this Agreement unless the Debt

 



     

 

 



 

Financing has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries Willful and Material Breach of its obligations under this
_Section 6.19_.

 



 

(g) Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 6.19_ and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses actually suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in
connection with the arrangement of any Debt Financing and any information used
in connection therewith, except to the extent such losses, damages, claims,
costs or expenses result from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
Representatives, and the foregoing obligations shall survive termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.20 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement and to consummate the Debt
Financing, and obtain the proceeds thereof, on or prior to the Closing Date on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Such actions
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

 



 

(i) maintaining in effect and complying with its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend
the Debt Commitment Letter so long as such replacement or amendment (A)
provides for Debt Financing in an amount not less than the existing Debt
Commitment Letter, (B) does not contain conditions precedent to the funding
thereof that are additions to the conditions precedent with respect to the
Debt Financing set forth in the existing Debt Commitment Letter, (C) would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (D) would not adversely affect
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements (it being understood that a
replacement or amendment may include a replacement or substitution of Debt
Financing Sources);

 



 

(ii) participation by senior management of Parent in, and assistance with, the
preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies;

 



 

(iii) satisfying, or causing their respective Representatives to satisfy, on a
timely basis, or obtaining waivers of, all Financing Conditions and all
conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Documents (it being understood
and agreed that such conditions shall be limited to the Financing Conditions);

 



 

(iv) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that
reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto); and

 



 

(v) enforcing their rights under the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed, upon the
Companys request, with respect to all material activity concerning the status
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and shall
give the Company notice of any material

 



     

 

 



 

adverse change with respect thereto as promptly as practicable. Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt written notice of any default, breach
or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter, or any termination
the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, of which Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates becomes aware.

 



 

(c) Without limiting Parents and Merger Subs other obligations under this
_Section 6.20_ , if a Financing Failure Event occurs Parent and Merger Sub
shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the
reasons therefor, (ii) in consultation with the Company, arrange and obtain
alternative debt financing from alternative financing sources (A) in an amount
sufficient to make the Required Payment Amount and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) upon terms no less favorable, taken as
a whole, than the existing Debt Commitment Letter and that in any event do not
impose additional conditions precedent or expand upon the conditions precedent
set forth in the existing Debt Commitment Letter (such alternative debt
financing, an " ** _Alternative Financing_** "), and negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to such Alternative Financing from the same
or alternative sources, and (iii) obtain, and when obtained, provide the
Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for the
Alternative Financing including any related fee letters (with redactions of
only the fee amounts payable on the Closing Date to the financing sources
thereunder and of the amounts by which interest rates or OID may change;
_provided_ that no redactions have been made of terms that could affect the
availability of, or conditionality applicable to the funding of, the Debt
Financing or reduce the net proceeds thereof to an amount, when combined with
other funds available to Parent and Merger Sub at Closing, less than the
amount necessary to pay the Required Payment Amount) (including all exhibits,
schedules and annexes thereto and together with the related fee letters, the "
** _New Debt Commitment Letter_** "). In the event any Alternative Financing
is obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered into in accordance
with this _Section 6.20(c)_ (i) any reference in this Agreement to " ** _Debt
Financing_** " shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (or defined terms
that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to
the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter, as the case may be,
at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then
in effect; _provided_ that in no event shall the Companys obligations to
cooperate in respect of the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement
(including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section 6.19_ this Agreement) be
expanded in connection with any Alternative Financing (but for the avoidance
of doubt, the Companys obligations set forth in _Section 6.19_ shall continue
to apply with respect to any Alternative Financing, but to no greater extent
than would have been required in connection with the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof).

 



 

(d) None of Parent and Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
agree to or permit any amendment, modification, supplement, restatement,
assignment, substitution or replacement of (or grant any waiver of any
condition, remedy or other provision under) the Debt Commitment Letter or any
Debt Financing Document except for substitutions and replacements pursuant to
_(a)_ or _Section 6.20(c)_.

 



 

Section 6.21 _Merger Proposal; Shareholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company and
Merger Sub, as applicable, shall take the following actions within the
timeframes set forth herein; provided, however, that any such actions or the
timeframe for taking such action shall be subject to any amendment in the
applicable provisions of the ICL (and in case of an amendment thereto, such
amendment shall automatically apply so as to amend this Section _6.21_
accordingly):

 



      

 

 



 

(i) cause an agreed upon merger proposal (in the Hebrew language) in the form
designated by the Companies Registrar (the " ** _Merger Proposal_** ") to be

(ii) deliver the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar for the purpose
thereof, signed by an authorized director of each of the Merger Sub and

(iii) the Company shall cause a copy of the Merger Proposal to be delivered to
its secured creditors, if any, no later than three (3) days after the date on
which the Merger Proposal is delivered to the Companies Registrar;

 



 

(iv) promptly after the Company shall have complied with clauses (iii) and
(v)(A) of this _Section _ _6.21_ but in any event no more than three (3)
business days following the date on which such notice was sent to the
creditors, the Company and Merger Sub shall inform the Companies Registrar, in
accordance with Section 317(b) of the ICL, that notice was given to their
respective creditors, if any, under Section 318 of the ICL;

 



 

(v) each of the Company and, if applicable, Merger Sub, shall: (A) publish a
notice to its creditors, stating that a Merger Proposal was submitted to the
Companies Registrar and that the creditors may review the Merger Proposal at
the office of the Companies Registrar, Companys registered office or Merger
Subs registered office, as applicable, and at such other locations as the
Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, may determine, in (x) two (2) daily
Israeli newspapers published in Hebrew, on the day that the Merger Proposal is
submitted to the Companies Registrar, and (y) a popular newspaper in New York
within three (3) business days after the date on which the Merger Proposal is
delivered to the Companies Registrar; (B) within four (4) business days from
the date of submitting the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar, send a
notice by registered mail to all of the "principal creditors" (as such term is
defined in the ICL) that the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, is aware
of, in which it shall state that a Merger Proposal was submitted to the
Companies Registrar and that the creditors may review the Merger Proposal at
such additional locations, if such locations were determined in the notice
referred to in clause (v)(A)(x) of this _Section_ _ 6.21(a)_; and (C) send to
the Companys "employees committee" ( _Va ad Ovdim_) (if any) or display in a
prominent place at the Companys premises a copy of the notice published in a
daily Hebrew newspaper (as referred to in clause (v)(A)(x) of this _Section
6.21_), no later than three (3) business days following the day on which the
Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar;

 



 

(vi) not later than three (3) days after the date on which the Requisite
Company Shareholder Approval is received, the Company shall (in accordance
with Section 317(b) of ICL) inform the Companies Registrar of such approval;
and

 



 

(vii) in accordance with the customary practice of the Companies Registrar,
the Company and Merger Sub shall request that the Companies Registrar declare
the Merger effective and issue the Certificate of Merger upon such date as the
Company and Merger Sub shall advise the Companies Registrar, provided that
such date is not earlier than thirty (30) days from the date of the
shareholder meetings of each of the Company and Merger Sub and not earlier
than fifty (50) days from the date on which the Merger Proposals were
submitted to the Companies Registrar pursuant to the ICL.

 



     

 

 



 

For purposes of this _Section 6.21(a)_, " ** _business day_** " shall have
the meaning set forth in the Israeli Companies Regulations (Merger), 2000
promulgated under the ICL.

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the Merger shall be declared effective
and the Certificate of Merger shall be issued on the Closing Date, as a
condition to the Closing taking place.

 



 

Section 6.22 _Real Property Matters_. The Company shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to sell the parcels of Owned Real Property located at (a)
Parcels 319, 320 and 323 in Block 6368 in Givat Shmuel, south of the Ramat Siv
Industrial Zone, and (b) 12987/20069 parts in Parcel 161 in Block 6368 (the "
** _Sale Property_** ") to a third party on such terms as are consented to by
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
_provided_ that such terms shall include a lease-back arrangement on the terms
set forth in _Section 6.22_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " **Lease-
Back Terms** "), _provided further_ that any Net Sale Proceeds from such sale
shall be deposited and maintained in a segregated, interest-bearing account of
the Company until the Closing. In the event that the Company does not sell the
Sale Property prior to Closing, then Company shall exercise its put option
pursuant to the Real Estate Put Agreement, and shall cause Global Village
Advisory Ltd. or one of its Affiliates (" ** _Global Village_** ") to purchase
the Sale Property from the Company and enter into a lease-back arrangement
with the Company on the Lease-Back Terms immediately prior to the Closing. If
the Company exercises its put option pursuant to the Real Estate Put
Agreement, Global Village may elect to satisfy the purchase price for the Sale
Property by offset of cash amounts otherwise payable to Global Village, or any
of its Affiliates, pursuant to Section 3.1 net of any withholding pursuant to
Section 3.13 and provided that such arrangement does not result in any
material Tax liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.23 _Replacement Guarantees_.

 



 

(a) _Section 6.23_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth certain
outstanding guarantees (" ** _Company Guarantee_** s") extended by certain
Related Parties of the Company (" ** _Company Guaranteeing Parties_** ") on
behalf of Company. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
secure the full release, effective as of the Closing Date, of the Company
Guaranteeing Parties by the beneficiaries or other counterparties to the
Company Guarantees; provided that, without the written consent of Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Company shall not
agree to make any payment to any such beneficiary or other counterparty or
amend in any manner adverse to the Company any obligation supported by any
Company Guarantee in order to secure such release. Parent shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the beneficiaries or counterparties of any
Company Guarantees in connection with the matters contemplated by this
_Section 6.23_, including information with respect to the creditworthiness of
Parent and the Surviving Company.

 



 

(b) In the event that definitive arrangements have not been made as of ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing for the Company Guaranteeing Parties
to be released from any Company Guarantee by the beneficiaries or other
counterparties of such Company Guarantee as of the Closing Date, then Parent
shall (i) propose to substitute Parent guarantees to replace the Company
Guarantees at or prior to the Closing (and, if accepted by the counterparties
to any Company Guarantees, Parent shall issue such Parent guarantees in
replacement thereof at the Closing) and (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms thereof (including any requirement to seek
consent of the counterparty), assume all obligations under each Company
Guarantee, in each case in order to secure the full release, effective as of
the Closing Date, of the Company Guaranteeing Parties from any obligations
under the Company Guarantees.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Subject to the receipt of any required third party consents, the Company
Guarantees shall be canceled and terminated or fully assumed by Parent as of
the Closing Date, and the Company Guaranteeing Parties have no further
obligation or liability (contingent or otherwise) under such Company
Guarantees from and after the Closing Date. If any Company Guarantee has not
been canceled and terminated or fully assumed by Parent as of the Closing
Date, then following the Closing, (i) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company Guaranteeing Parties from and against any and all Losses suffered
or incurred by them after the Closing Date in connection with the Company
Guarantees, and (ii) Parent shall not, without the applicable Company
Guaranteeing Partys prior written consent, amend in any manner adverse to the
Company Guaranteeing Parties, or extend (or permit the extension of), any
obligation supported by any Company Guarantee.

 



 

(d) The Company and Parent shall take all actions necessary to secure the full
release, effective as of the Closing Date, of the Liens set forth on _Section
6.23(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that, without the
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), the Company shall not agree to make any payment to the
Lienholder or amend in any manner adverse to the Company any obligation
supported by such Liens in order to secure such release. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that definitive arrangements have not been made as of
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing for the release of the Liens set
forth on _Section 6.23(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent and the
Company shall (i) propose to provide a Parent guarantee of the obligations
supported by such Liens, (ii) propose to provide the holder of such Liens with
Liens over assets of Parent equal to the value of the assets subject to the
Liens set forth on _Section 6.22_, of whatever type and wherever located,
unless such actions would cause a default under Parents credit arrangements,
and (iii) if the undertakings in clause (i) and (ii) are insufficient to
secure the release of such Liens, provide whatever forms of credit support,
including letters of credit and/or cash collateralization), as may be
necessary to secure the release of such Liens, unless such actions would cause
a default under Parents credit arrangements, with the out-of-pocket fronting
fee costs and carrying costs of such credit support (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, not the cost of any amounts drawn on such credit support or the
principal amount of any cash collateral) attributable to a period of up to 12
months from the Closing Date being borne 50% by Parent and 50% by the Company
as a Company Transaction Expense (and any such costs subsequent to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date being borne 100% by Parent).

 



 

Section 6.24 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege._

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Direct Parent waive and will not assert, and agrees to
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after
the Closing, of the Company Equityholders, the Shareholder Representative or
any shareholder, officer, employee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (any such Person, a " ** _Designated Person_** ") in any matter
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
thereby, including any litigation or other dispute proceeding between or among
Parent, Direct Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and any Designated Person, by Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP, Fischer Behar Chen Well Orion and Co or any other legal counsel currently
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby
(whether or not such legal counsel also represented any of the Company
Equityholders) (the " ** _Current Representation_** "), even though the
interests of such Designated Person may be directly adverse to Parent, Direct
Parent or their respective Affiliates, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Direct Parent further agrees, on behalf of itself and,
after the Closing, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, that all
communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among any of Davis
Polk and Wardwell LLP, Fischer Behar Chen Well Orion

 



     

 

 



 

and Co or any other legal counsel representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Current Representation, the Company, any of the Company
Equityholders, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
other representatives that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or,
beginning on the date of this Agreement, any dispute arising under this
Agreement (collectively, the " ** _Deal Communications_** ") shall be deemed
to be retained and owned collectively by the Designated Persons, shall be
controlled by the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Company
Indemnified Parties and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Direct
Parent or the Company. All Deal Communications that are attorney-client
privileged (the " ** _Privileged Deal Communications_** ") shall remain
privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Shareholder
Representative and the Company Indemnified Parties, shall be controlled by the
Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Company Indemnified Parties and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Direct Parent or the Company;
provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a
waiver by Parent, Direct Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Affiliates) of any applicable privileges or
protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of any such
communications to any third party.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, Direct Parent or the Company, on the one hand, and a third party other
than the Shareholder Representative or a Company Indemnified Party, on the
other hand, Parent, Direct Parent or the Company may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal
Communications to such third party; provided, however, that neither the
Parent, Direct Parent or the Company may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative. In the event that
Parent, Direct Parent or the Company is legally required by order or otherwise
to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Deal
Communications, Parent or Direct Parent shall immediately (and, in any event,
within two (2) business days) notify the Shareholder Representative in writing
(including by making specific reference to this Section) so that the
Shareholder Representative can seek a protective order and each of Parent and
Direct Parent agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist
therewith.

 



 

(d) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP or and Fischer Behar Chen Well Orion and Co constitute property of
its clients, only the Shareholder Representative and the Company Indemnified
Parties shall hold such property rights and Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP and
Fischer Behar Chen Well Orion and Co shall have no duty to reveal or disclose
any such files or other materials or any Privileged Deal Communications by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP
or Fischer Behar Chen Well Orion and Co, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand so long as such files or other materials would be subject to a
privilege or protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by an
unrelated third party.

 



 

(e) Each of Parent and Direct Parent agrees that it will not, and that it will
cause the Company not to, seek to obtain the Deal Communications from Davis
Polk and Wardwell LLP or Fischer Behar Chen Well Orion and Co so long as such Deal
Communications would be subject to a privilege or protection if they were
being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third party.

 



 

Section 6.25 _Post-Closing Operation of the Company_. As of the date hereof,
Parent acknowledges that it intends to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to continue to operate in the Ordinary Course of Business from and after the
Closing, including with respect to generally maintaining the workforce of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing, except as
may be deemed appropriate by Parent in connection with the integration of the
businesses of Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.25_, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any Person, including the Shareholder Representative and
any current or

 



     

 

 



 

former employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.26 _Israeli Securities Authority Approval_. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause its Israeli counsel, in
consultation with Companys Israeli counsel, to prepare and file with the
Israeli Securities Authority an application for a letter, in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, from the Israeli Securities
Authority stating that the Israeli Securities Authority shall not intervene in
the position of Parent that a publication of a prospectus under the Israeli
Securities Law, 1968 is not required or exempting the Parent from the
requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968 concerning the publication of
a prospectus in respect of the issuance of Parent Common Stock to the
applicable Company Equityholders in the context of the transactions
contemplated under the Transaction Agreements (the " ** _ISA Exemption
Letter_** ").

 



 

Section 6.27 _Intellectual Property Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain assignments
from all inventors of all patents and patent applications that are set forth
on _Section 6.27_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (b) record all such
assignments, and (c) provide evidence of such recordation to Parent, in each
of cases (a)(c), to the extent any such assignments have not been executed
and recorded as of the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no failure to
obtain, record or provide evidence of recordation of such assignments shall be
interpreted as a breach of this _Section 6.27_; _provided_ that the Company
has discharged its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, record and provide evidence of recordation of such assignments as set
forth in the preceding sentence.

 



 

Section 6.28 _Securities Law Matters_.

 



 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that the shares of Parent Common Stock
included in the Aggregate Stock Consideration will not initially be registered
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and
the offer and sale of the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the
Aggregate Stock Consideration is being made in reliance on one or more
exemptions for private offerings under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
other applicable securities Laws. The parties further acknowledge and agree
that the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Aggregate Stock
Consideration constitute "restricted securities" as such term is defined in
Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Shareholders Agreement and the separate lock-up agreements with Parent entered
into by the holders of the Company Preferred Shares and Ordinary Shares (other
than the Company Significant Stockholder) and the CVR Holders set forth
additional transfer restrictions with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock included in the Aggregate Stock Consideration received by such holders.

 



 

(b) For purposes of Rule 144(d), the parties intend for the holding period of
all of the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Aggregate Stock
Consideration (including any shares of Parent Common Stock included in the
Escrow Stock Account), to the extent permitted by applicable law (including
applicable interpretations by the SEC), to commence on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) The parties agree that the book-entry notation representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock included in the Aggregate Stock Consideration shall
contain legends substantially in the form of the following, as well as any
additional legends that may be required by applicable law; _provided, however_
, that only shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Escrow Stock Account
shall bear the third legend identified below:

 



     

 

 



 

THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT") OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER
JURISDICTION. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (1) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OR (2) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS AND THE SECURITIES LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS, OR IN A
TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION.

 



 

THE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE
STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT DATED [ ] BY AND AMONG THE ISSUER, THE HOLDER OF THE
SHARES AND CERTAIN OTHER PERSONS OR THE LOCKUP AGREEMENT DATED [ ] BY AND
BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE HOLDER OF THE SHARES, WHICH RESTRICT THE RIGHT TO
TRANSFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF THE SECURITIES.

 



 

THE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO AN ESCROW AGREEMENT WITH THE ISSUER AND THE
ESCROW AGENT NAMED THEREIN (THE "ESCROW AGREEMENT"), WHICH RESTRICT THE RIGHT
TO TRANSFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF THE SECURITIES. THESE SECURITIES
WILL BE DEPOSITED WITH THE ESCROW AGENT PURSUANT TO THE ESCROW AGREEMENT AND
MAY NOT TRANSFERRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF FOR SO LONG AS THEY ARE
SUBJECT TO THE ESCROW AGREEMENT.

 



 

(d) Parent shall remove (or cause the transfer agent to remove) the first
legend identified above from the book-entry notation representing any part of
the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Aggregate Stock
Consideration (and terminate any related stop-transfer orders) upon (i) in the
case of shares of Parent Common Stock held by the Company Significant
Stockholder, the request of the Company Significant Stockholder and the
issuance by Parents legal counsel or legal counsel of the Company Significant
Stockholder of a legal opinion that the first legend identified above can be
removed from such shares and (ii) in the case of all other shares of Parent
Common Stock, the six month anniversary of the Closing Date. Parent agrees to

, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ _ 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to either party if its action
or failure to act constitutes a material breach or violation of any of its
covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder and such material breach
or violation has been the principal cause of or directly resulted in (A) the
failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the terminating party

Date;

this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) by the Company if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or

failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_
and (B) (1) is not capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date or (2)
is not cured by the Company on or before the earlier of (x) the Termination
Date and (y) the date that is thirty (30) days following the receipt by the

8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties,

forth in this _Section 8.2_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and of no effect without Liability on the part of any party hereto (or
any of its Representatives), and all rights and obligations of any party
hereto shall cease; _provided_ that, subject to _Section 8.2(b)_ and _Section

Willful and Material Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein or (y) the Willful and Material Breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein shall
cause the Closing not to occur, then, notwithstanding such termination, such

(including pursuant to _Section 10.15_), Liabilities or other losses of any
kind, in each case, incurred or suffered by the other party or its Affiliates

and Material Breach by another party that is the primary cause of the
termination of this Agreement or results in the Closing not occurring shall
not be limited to (x) the Reverse Termination Fee or Acquisition Proposal

fee and instead pursues a claim for Damages and (y) reimbursement of out-of-
pocket expenses and costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain lost

Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed, (B) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ (as long as, in the case of termination of

_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, the Parent Acquisition Proposal was publicly announced
or disclosed and not withdrawn at the time of the Parent Stockholder Meeting)
and (C) within 12 months after such termination, Parent enters into a
definitive agreement in respect of a Parent Acquisition Proposal or
consummates a Parent Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Parent
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clauses (A) and (B), unless, during any
three (3) month period after the termination of this Agreement and prior to
entering into such definitive agreement or consummating such subsequent Parent
Acquisition Proposal, there was no Parent Acquisition Proposal that had been
publicly announced and not withdrawn, then Parent shall pay or cause to be
paid to the Company a fee of $13,625,000 and shall reimburse the Company for
its Company Expenses up to a maximum reimbursement of $2,275,000 (the " **
_Acquisition Proposal Termination Fee_** ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than five (5) Business days after (x) the date of
termination in the event of a termination described in the foregoing clauses
(i) or (ii), (y) in the event of a termination described in the foregoing
clause (iii) in which Parent executes a definitive agreement with respect to
or consummates a Parent Acquisition Proposal with a Third Party that made a
Parent Acquisition Proposal that was made and not withdrawn at the time of the
Parent Stockholder Meeting, the earlier of the date of consummation of the
Parent Acquisition Proposal or execution of a definitive agreement with
respect thereto, or (z) in the event of a termination described in the
foregoing clause (iii) in which Parent executes a definitive agreement with
respect to or consummates a Parent Acquisition Proposal with a Third Party
that made a Parent Acquisition Proposal after the Parent Stockholder Meeting,
the date of consummation of such Parent Acquisition Proposal (provided, that,
for purpose of clause (iii) of this _Section 8.2(c)_, each reference to 20%
in the definition of " ** _Parent Acquisition Proposal_** " shall be deemed to
be a reference to "50%").

 



 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_, Parent shall reimburse the Company and its Affiliates by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, no later than two Business Days after
submission of documentation therefor, for 100% of their Company Expenses, up
to an aggregate maximum reimbursement of $5,000,000. Any such expense
reimbursement will be credited against any Acquisition Proposal Termination
Fee that is payable in connection with such termination or that subsequently
becomes payable.

 



 

(e) In the event any party fails to pay any amount due pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_ when due, such party shall also pay any costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the other parties in connection with a legal action to
enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against such first party,
together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the
publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost
or expense was required to be paid through the payment date.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
each of the Parties expressly acknowledges and agrees that, except in the case
of Fraud, in connection with any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, in circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is due and
payable under _Section 8.2(b)_ and is actually paid or the Acquisition
Proposal Termination Fee is due and payable under _Section 8.2(c)_ and is
actually paid and, in either such case, such Reverse

 



     

 

 



 

Termination Fee or Acquisition Proposal Termination Fee is accepted by the
Company (it being understood that, in the event a Willful and Material Breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
resulted, directly or indirectly, in the termination of this Agreement or the
failure of the Closing to occur, the Company may decline to accept payment of
such fee and to instead pursue a claim for Damages against Parent in
accordance with _Section 8.2(a)_), (x) the Companys right to receive payment
of such Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or Acquisition
Proposal Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether in law or equity, contract, tort or otherwise) of
the Company, any Related Party of the Company or any other Persons, in each
case under this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters (including the sole and
exclusive remedy against the Financing Source Related Parties), any definitive
agreements entered into in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or any
other documents referred to herein or therein, the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination hereof or thereof), any

any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to be
consummated, any matter forming the basis for any such termination, whether or
not directly or indirectly resulting from or relating to a breach of, default
or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any other agreement, or
otherwise (all such documents, transactions and matters referenced in this
clause (x), collectively, the " ** _Transaction Matters_** "), (y) the Reverse
Termination Fee or the Acquisition Proposal Termination Fee, as applicable,
shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by the Company, any Related Party of the Company or any
other Persons in connection with any termination of this Agreement, and (z)
none of the Company, any other Related Party of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, Subsidiaries or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any Action or otherwise in any way assert any Liability against
Parent, any Related Party of Parent, any Financing Source Related Party or any
of their respective Affiliates, in each case in any way directly or indirectly
relating to or arising out of or in connection with any Transaction Matter;
_provided_ , _that_ (i) nothing in this _Section 8.2(f)_ shall limit the (A)
the right of the Company (subject to the final sentence of this _Section
8.2(f)_) to bring or maintain any action, claim or proceeding for injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in _Section
10.11_, in each case, prior to termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, (B) the right of the Company to bring or maintain any Action
arising out of or in connection with any breach of the Confidentiality
Agreement against Parent, (C) the right of a party to collect interest, costs
and expenses under _Section 8.2(e)_ or (D) the obligations of Parent under
_Section 6.8(h)_ and _Section 6.19(g)_ and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent and its Affiliates shall have recourse against the Financing Source
Related Parties pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter. For the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in,
_Section 10.11_ and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a
grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by _Section 10.11_
that results in a consummation of the Closing and (ii) payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee.

Section 9.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, from
and after the Closing, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) (the " **
_Parent Indemnified Parties_** ") shall be indemnified and held harmless by
each holder of Company Shares (other than any holder of Company Special
Shares) as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " ** _Parent Indemnifying
Parties_** "), severally as to itself only in accordance with _Section
9.3(c)(ii)_, and not jointly or jointly and severally, from and against all
Losses paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the Parent Indemnified
Parties, or any of them, directly or indirectly, resulting from, arising out
of, or relating to any of the following:

 



 

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection with the Closing,
without giving effect to any qualifications based on the word "material" or
similar phrases (including "Company Material Adverse Effect") limiting the
scope of such representation or warranty;

 



 

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) subject to _Section 9.3(e)_, the Indemnified Taxes.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Company Equityholders (other than any
holder of Company Special Shares) and the CVR Holders (the " ** _Company
Indemnified Parties_** ") shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent
(the " ** _Company Indemnifying Parties_** ") from and against all Losses
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the Company Indemnified Parties, or
any of them, directly or indirectly, resulting from, arising out of, or
relating to any of the following:

 



 

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection with
the Closing,

 



     

 

 



 

without giving effect to any qualifications based on the word "material" or
similar phrases (including "Parent Material Adverse Effect") limiting the
scope of such representation or warranty;

 



 

(ii) any failure by Parent, Direct Parent or Merger Sub to perform or comply
with any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) if a Company Guarantee has not been canceled and terminated as of the
Closing Date, such Company Guarantee.

 



 

(c) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, " ** _Loss_** " or " **
_Losses_** " shall mean any and all losses, Taxes, Liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs, interest, awards, judgments, penalties and expenses of
any nature (including reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses
and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or
settling any of the matters set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that " ** _Loss_** " or " ** _Losses_** " (i) shall not include
(a) indirect or consequential damages, lost profits or diminution in value,
unless in each case such amounts are the natural and foreseeable consequence
of the breach giving rise to indemnification therefor (it being acknowledged
and agreed that diminution in value of the shares of Parent Common Stock that
are issued in the Merger (x) is the natural and foreseeable consequence of any
breach by Parent of its representations and warranties that results in Parent
suffering any Losses and (y) may be a natural and foreseeable consequence of
any breach by Parent of its covenants that results in Parent suffering any
Losses) or (b) punitive damages except to the extent actually payable to a
third party, (ii) shall be reduced by the amount of any cash Tax benefit
actually realized during in the taxable year that the Loss was incurred as a
result of such Loss that was indemnified hereunder, or indemnification
associated therewith (determined on a "with and without" basis by comparing
the excess of (x) the hypothetical aggregate cash liability for Taxes of the
indemnified party and its Affiliates disregarding the Tax effects of the
relevant Loss that was indemnified hereunder, over (y) the aggregate cash
liability for Taxes of the indemnified party and its Affiliates taking into
account the effects of the relevant Loss, and further provided that the amount
of any reduction to Loss shall be net of any costs or other expenses incurred
by the indemnified party or its Affiliates in connection with recognizing the
relevant Tax benefit) and (iii) shall include any Taxes incurred by an
indemnified party in connection with the receipt of an indemnity payment made
hereunder. To the extent permitted by Law, the parties agree to treat
indemnification payments made hereunder as adjustments to the purchase price
payable to the Company Equityholders hereunder. Any indemnifiable Losses shall
be calculated net of actual recoveries under existing insurance policies (net
of any actual collection costs (including Taxes) and reserves, deductibles,
premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums as determined in good
faith by the Indemnified Party). If an Indemnified Party receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies subsequent to its receipt of an
indemnification payment by an Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party
will, without duplication, promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
indemnification payment made by such Indemnifying Party up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party net of all expenses or other Losses
associated with recovery of such amounts and any actual or reasonably
foreseeable increased premiums with respect thereto. Any liability for
indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach or other violation of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, certificate or certification.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any indemnity payments payable by
the Company Indemnifying Parties or the Parent Indemnifying Parties, the fact
that the Company Equityholders are holders of Parent Common Stock shall be
considered in calculating the amount of any Losses.

 



 

(d) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect

 



     

 

 



 

to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any other matter. The
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or
agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(e) No Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any
representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such
Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement hereunder.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article IX_, Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
_Article IX_ for any Losses to the extent that the amount otherwise
indemnifiable hereunder has been specifically included in the calculation of
the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

 



 

(g) Each party seeking indemnification hereunder shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses it may pay, incur or sustain for
which indemnification is sought hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) To the extent the Indemnified Parties suffer any Losses pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(i)_:

 



 

(i) to the extent that the retention amount under either the Parent RandW
Insurance Policy or the Company RandW Insurance Policy, as applicable (the " **
_Retention Limit_** "), has not been met, then the Indemnifying Parties shall
have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Parties in respect of any
claims for such Losses pursuant to _Section_ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ _
9.2(b)(i)_;

 



 

(ii) to the extent the Retention Limit has been met and the amount of such
Losses are less than the total policy limit under the Company RandW Insurance
Policy or the Parent RandW Insurance Policy, as applicable (the " ** _R andW
Cap_**"), then the Indemnifying Parties shall have no obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Parties in respect of claims for such Losses pursuant to
_Section_ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ _ 9.2(b)(i)_ and (without limiting
indemnification claims made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_) the
Indemnified Parties shall seek recovery of any such Losses solely pursuant to
the Company RandW Insurance Policy or the Parent RandW Insurance Policy, as
applicable;

 



 

(iii) to the extent that the Retention Limit and the RandW Cap have been met,
then (x) to the extent such Losses relate to a claim pursuant to _Section_ _
9.2(a)(i)_ for Fraud or breaches of the Fundamental Company Representations or
_Section_ _ 9.2(b)(i)_ for Fraud or breaches of the Fundamental Parent
Representations, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to pursue recovery
of such Losses directly from Indemnifying Parties subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 9.3(b)_ below) and (y) to the
extent such Losses relate to a claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ other
than for Fraud or breaches of the Fundamental Company Representations or
_Section 9.2(b)(i)_ other than for Fraud or breaches of the Fundamental
Parent Representations, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Parties in respect of any such Losses hereunder.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent, on
behalf of itself and each other Parent Indemnified Party and the Company, on
behalf of each Company Indemnified Party, acknowledge and agree that the
provisions of this _Section 9.3_ shall apply regardless of whether (x) Parent
or the Shareholder Representative obtains or maintains the Parent RandW
Insurance Policy or the Company RandW Insurance Policy, respectively, following
the Closing, (y) the Parent RandW Insurance Policy or the Company RandW Insurance
Policy, as applicable, is revoked, cancelled or modified in any manner after
issuance thereof, or (z) other than indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(iii),_ any Parent Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party makes
a claim under the Parent RandW Insurance Policy or the Company RandW Insurance
Policy, respectively, and such claim is denied, excluded or otherwise limited
or restricted in any manner thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the RandW Cap for Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section
9.2(b)(i) be less than $50,000,000 and $13,325,000, respectively, regardless
of whether the Parent or the Shareholder Representative obtains or maintains
the Parent RandW Insurance Policy or the Company RandW Insurance Policy,
respectively, following the Closing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

 



 

(i) the applicable Indemnifying Parties aggregate Liability for
indemnification obligations set forth in (x) _Section_ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_ or
_Section_ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ for Fraud or breaches of the Fundamental Company
Representations, or (y) _Section_ _ 9.2(b)(ii)_ or _Section_ _ 9.2(b)(i)_
for Fraud or breaches of the Fundamental Parent Representations, as
applicable, shall not exceed the value of the _sum_ of (A) the Aggregate Cash
Consideration _minus_ the Pathfinder Preferred Liquidation Preference _plus_
(B) the cash value of the Aggregate Stock Consideration (valued based upon the
Base Value Per Share);

 



 

(ii) with respect to any indemnification obligation of the Parent Indemnifying
Parties, other than pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, (A) each Parent
Indemnifying Partys share of such indemnification obligation shall be limited
to the product of (1) the quotient of (x) the amount by which the portion of
the Aggregate Stock Consideration and Aggregate Cash Consideration that such
Parent Indemnifying Party received pursuant to _Article III_ would have been
reduced, divided by (y) the amount by which the Aggregate Stock Consideration
and Aggregate Cash Consideration that all Parent Indemnifying Parties received
pursuant to _Article III_ would have been reduced, in each case of clauses
(x) and (y), if the sum of the cash value of the Aggregate Stock Consideration
(valued based upon the Base Value Per Share) and the Aggregate Cash
Consideration were reduced by the amount of such indemnification obligation
(taking into account the application of this clause (ii) on account of any
prior indemnification obligations of the Parent Indemnifying Parties)
_multiplied by_ (2) the total amount of such indemnification obligation, (B)
each Parent Indemnifying Partys maximum liability for indemnification
obligations hereunder shall be limited to the portion of the sum of the cash
value of the Aggregate Stock Consideration (valued based upon the Surrender
Value Per Share) and the Aggregate Cash Consideration actually received by
such Parent Indemnifying Party and (C) each Parent Indemnifying Party may
elect to satisfy any of its indemnification obligations hereunder by either
the payment of cash or the surrender of shares of Parent Common Stock, with
each share of Parent Common Stock valued at (such value, the " ** _Surrender
Value Per Share_** ") (x) if such shares of Parent Common Stock are subject to
a lock-up pursuant to the Restated Stockholders Agreement or a separate lock-
up agreement with Parent, the Base Value Per Share, and (y) if such shares of
Parent Common Stock are not subject to a lock-up pursuant to the Restated
Stockholders Agreement or a separate lock-up agreement with Parent, the
closing trading price of the Parent Common Stock on the trading day that is
three (3) trading days prior to the date on which the indemnification payment
is made.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of indemnification obligations set
forth in _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ for Fraud, the Parent Indemnifying Parties shall
be required to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties in accordance with
_Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts
subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall not be
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_.

 



 

(e) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall use good faith efforts to seek
coverage (to the extent there is a reasonable basis for seeking such coverage)
under any applicable insurance policies before seeking indemnity from the
Parent Indemnifying Parties for claims pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Losses subject to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, the amount of such Losses
that may be recovered by the Parent indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_ shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate Losses
incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to the relevant
indemnification claim made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Indemnity Escrow Account_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, 2,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be
delivered to the holders of Company Ordinary Shares and the CVR Holders (pro
rata in accordance with the aggregate Ordinary Per Share Stock Amount issuable
to them) (the " ** _Escrow Stock Amount_** ") into an escrow account (the " **
_Indemnity Escrow Account_** ") established pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement in order to support the payment obligations (if any) of the
holders of Company Ordinary Shares and the CVR Holders under _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Stock Amount shall be available to compensate the Parent
Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or
incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_. Except as set forth below, the period during which claims for
Losses to be recovered from the Indemnity Escrow Account may be made under
this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and terminate on December
31, 2024 (the " ** _Escrow Period_** "), _provided_ , however, that (i) on the
date that is two years from the date hereof, the Shareholder Representative
and the Company shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release all but 1,500,000
shares of Parent Common Stock and distribute such shares in accordance with
_Section 9.4(c)_, and (ii) on the date that is three years from the date
hereof, the Shareholder Representative and the Company shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to release all but 1,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and
distribute such shares in accordance with _Section 9.4(c)_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent there is any pending claim under _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_ at a time when shares of Parent Common Stock would be released
pursuant to this _Section 9.4(b)_ or the Escrow Period would otherwise
terminate, the release of any shares of Parent Common Stock that is the
subject of a pending claim shall be deferred until such claim is resolved and
the termination of the Escrow Period shall be extended until the date that
there are no longer any unresolved claims for recovery under _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_. No Parent Indemnifying Party shall be liable under _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_, and the Parent Indemnified Parties will not look to the Parent
Indemnifying Parties with respect to any claim under _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_
for which the Shareholder Representative is notified following the termination
of the Escrow Period or if and to the extent the amount recoverable pursuant
to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ exceeds the portion of the Escrow Stock Amount
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 



 

(c) Upon any release of Shares from the Indemnity Escrow Account, including
upon the termination of the Escrow Period, the Shareholder Representative and
the Company shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute (i) to the holders
of Ordinary Shares (pro rata in accordance with the number of Ordinary Shares
held by each such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time), a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the total number of
shares of Parent

 



     

 

 



 

Common Stock remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, multiplied by (B) the
Ordinary Shares Share Escrow Release Percentage, and (ii) to ECI BV (for
payment to each CVR Holder, pro rata in accordance with their respective CVR
Percentages (as defined in the CVR Deeds)), a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account multiplied by (B) the
CVR Share Escrow Release Percentage.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.1_, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this _Article IX_, such
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an " ** _Indemnification
Claim Notice_** ") to the Shareholder Representative or the Parent, as
applicable (with a copy to the Escrow Agent in the case of an indemnification
claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_), (i) stating that an Indemnified
Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or has received notice of the
commencement of an audit or similar proceeding as a result of which it
reasonably expects, based on any particular stated subject matter of such
audit or proceeding (and not the taxable period to which the audit or
proceeding relates), that it will pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and
(ii) specifying such Losses in reasonable detail (to the extent available and
known by such Indemnified Party), the date (if available) that each such Loss
was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or the basis for such anticipated
Liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related. The Indemnified Party may update an
Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any change in
circumstances following the date of initial delivery thereof; _provided_ that
the update relates to the underlying facts and circumstances described in the
initial Indemnification Claim Notice. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no claim shall be treated as made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_
unless, in the case of a claim pursuant to clause (d) of the definition of
Indemnified Taxes, the Taxes that form the basis of such claim are the subject
of an engagement with a Tax Authority under a voluntary disclosure or similar
program or are reflected on a Tax Return or, in the case of any claim for
Indemnified Taxes, the Company or any of its Affiliates has received notice of
the commencement of an audit or other similar proceeding as a result of which
Parent reasonably expects, based on any particular stated subject matter of
such audit or proceeding (and not the taxable period to which the audit or
proceeding relates) that a claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ will be
made.

 



 

(b) In the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from
an Indemnifying Party, the parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims for
which indemnification is sought. In the case of indemnification sought
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, if the Shareholder Representative, on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, and the Indemnified Party should so agree,
a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent with joint written
instructions to disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Stock Amount in
accordance with such memorandum. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such joint written instructions and make distributions from the Escrow
Stock Amount in accordance with the terms thereof. In such event, in the case
of indemnification sought pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly release to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Account shares of
Parent Common Stock with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set forth in
such joint written instruction, with such Parent Common Stock valued at the
closing trading price of the Parent Common Stock on the trading day that is
three (3) trading days prior to the date on which the indemnification payment
is made.

 



 

(c) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party may file suit with respect to the matter in any court having
jurisdiction.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) In the event of any claim or demand subject to indemnification under this
_Article IX_ made by any third party against any Indemnified Party (a " **
_Third Party Claim_** "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver the related
Indemnification Claim Notice to the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties), within thirty (30) days after such Indemnified
Party receives notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _that_ no delay
or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying
Parties shall relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their obligations
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Parties are actually prejudiced thereby (and
then solely to the extent of such prejudice).

 



 

(e) Other than with respect to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_, the Indemnifying Parties upon written notice to the Indemnified
Parties within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Parties of the commencement of such Third Party Claim (which notice shall
include an acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Parties that such Third Party
Claim is indemnifiable hereunder if the material facts alleged in such Third
Party Claim at the time of assumption of the defense are ultimately determined
to be accurate, and subject to the indemnification limitations set forth in
_Section 9.2_), may assume, at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Parties,
the defense of such claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Parties
and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _that_ the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and the fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that if in the opinion of counsel to any
Indemnified Party, (x) there are or may be legal defenses available to such
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party or (y) there exists a conflict or potential conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party, the legal
fees and expenses of one firm of counsel (and appropriate local counsel) to
the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Parties. If the
Indemnifying Parties assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties
in such defense. If the Indemnifying Parties assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Parties (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment (A) includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Parties and (B) such compromise or settlement shall not impose
on any Indemnified Party or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates any
obligation and (C) does not primarily relate to Taxes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will any Parent Indemnifying Party be entitled to
control any Third Party Claim (i) that primarily relates to Taxes unless such
claim relates solely to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, and it is reasonably expected (taking into account
relevant limits on indemnification under this Agreement) that greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the Losses associated with such claim will be borne by
the Indemnifying Parties; or (ii) that is subject to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_. In the event that the Indemnifying Parties fails to
elect to assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in the manner
set forth in this Section _ 9.5(e)_, the Indemnified Parties may, at the
Indemnifying Parties cost and expense, defend against the Third Party Claim
in any manner it deems reasonably appropriate; _provided_ , _that_ the
Indemnifying Parties shall nonetheless have the right, at the Indemnifying
Parties sole cost and expense, to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim giving rise to the Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification.
The Indemnified Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim in respect of which
indemnification may be sought hereunder, other than with respect to any Third
Party Claim that is subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_. With respect to any Third Party Claim that is subject to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ in an amount equal to or
greater than $350,000, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying
Parties reasonably informed regarding any potential settlement or other
resolution of such Third Party Claim, and shall consider any comments of the
Indemnifying Parties regarding the settlement or other resolution of such
Third Party Claim in good faith.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the rights of the
Parent Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties to be
indemnified pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties
and their respective Related Parties, respectively with respect to any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in, or any
other breach of, this Agreement, or otherwise in connection with the
Transaction Matters (other than specific performance pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 10.11_ and any rights to recovery the Parent
Indemnified Parties or the Company Indemnified Parties may have under the
Parent RandW Insurance Policy or the Company RandW Insurance Policy,
respectively). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 9.6_ is
intended or shall be deemed to restrict any rights that any holder of Parent
Common Stock following the Closing may have with respect to such Parent Common
Stock under the Stockholders Agreement or pursuant to the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act.

Section 10.2 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or information in any
Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as
applicable, shall be deemed to be disclosure of such fact, circumstance or
information with respect to all other Sections of the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter where the applicability of such fact,
circumstance or information is reasonably apparent. The inclusion of any item
in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be
deemed to be an admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall
it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever. No
disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or
violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.
When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit,
such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes and Appendices, and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have
the

 



     

 

 



 

defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor Laws and the related regulations and
published interpretations thereof; _provided_ , that for purposes of any
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of
a specific date or dates, references to any Law shall be deemed to refer to
such Law, as amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder,
in each case, as of such date. References to a Person are also to its
successors and permitted assigns. The words "made available to Parent" or
words of similar import refer to documents (x) posted to the Electronic Data
Room or (y) delivered in Person or electronically to Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Representatives. The specification of any dollar amount in
any representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ is
not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, are or are
not material for purposes of this Agreement, and no party shall use the fact
of the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or controversy between
or among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. The
phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or
phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to November 14, 2019 unless
the context requires otherwise. When used in reference to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, the term "material" shall be measured against the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be construed to
have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall." References to "$" or
"dollars" in this Agreement shall mean United States dollars. Words describing
the singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa,
words denoting any gender shall be deemed to include all genders and words
denoting natural Persons shall be deemed to include business entities and vice
versa. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take
any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after
the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Company to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger
Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Parent
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite Parent
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that
by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Parent without
such further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of this _Section 10.3_ or _Section
10.9_, _Section 10.10_, _Section 10.12_, _Section 10.14_, or _Section
10.18_ (or any of the defined terms used therein or any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
defined term or provision would modify the substance of the foregoing
Sections) (collectively, the " ** _DFS Provisions_** ") may be amended or
waived in any manner adverse to the Financing Sources without the written
consent of the affected Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of the first sentence of _Section 10.3_, waive compliance with
any agreement or condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising

 



     

 

 



 

any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly set forth herein
(including Section _ 3.2(c)(i)_, _Section 6.8(h)_, _Section 6.19(g)_,
_Section 8.2_ and _Section 10.15_), all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including as
a result of the acquisition of the equity interests in the Company of the
Company Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement) shall be borne equally by
Parent, on one hand, and by the Company Equityholders (other than Pathfinder)
as a Company Expense, on the other hand, except that all Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the sale of the Sale Property shall be borne by
the Company Equityholders (other than Pathfinder). For the avoidance of doubt,
all Transfer Taxes for which the Company Equityholders are responsible
pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ shall be included as Company Expenses, even
if the relevant Taxes are not required to be paid until after the Closing.
Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with one another in filing
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer
Taxes, including by promptly supplying any information in their possession
that is reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns. Costs and expenses
associated with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns relating to
Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including as a result of the acquisition of the equity
interests in the Company of the Company Equityholders pursuant to this
Agreement) shall be borne equally by Parent, on one hand, and by the Company
Equityholders as a Company Expense, on the other hand.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law,
or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable,
(b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Assignment_. Parent may assign its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Parent, provided that no
such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations to the Company
hereunder. Other than pursuant to the preceding sentence, neither this
Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the
proceeding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors
and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, after the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub may assign their
rights (but not their obligations) hereunder without the prior written consent
of the Company to (a) any of Parent and/or Merger Subs Affiliates or (b) any
of the financing sources of Parent and Merger Sub (including the Financing
Sources) to the extent necessary for purposes of creating a security interest
herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement as collateral in respect of the
Debt Financing.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules, Annexes and Appendices hereto and other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) constitutes, together with the other Transaction Agreements,
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the entire
agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 10.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for (a) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the applicable
Company Equityholders to receive the Per Share Consideration and any
additional amounts to which such Company Equityholders may be entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.7(e)_, _Section 3.7(_f), _Section 3.7(h)_, _Section
3.7(i)_, _Section 9.4_ and _Section 10.16(b)_, (b) from and after the

to the extent of, the Indemnity Escrow Amount, (d) from and after the
Effective Time, the rights of Pathfinder receive the Pathfinder Preferred
Liquidation Preference pursuant to _Section 3.16_, (e) the right of the

_Section 9.4_ and _Section 10.16(b)_, and/or pursue equitable relief or
pursue a claim for damages in the event of Parents or Merger Subs breach of
this Agreement or Fraud, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub, and (f) the provisions of _Section 6.10_ (which shall
be enforceable by the DandO Indemnitees). The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 10.4_ without notice or Liability to any other
Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
Financing Source Related Party shall be an express third-party beneficiary
with respect to the DFS Provisions to the extent relating to the rights or
obligations of such Financing Source Related Party.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or

hereto that are organized and existing under the ICL and (ii) all other
provisions of, or transactions contemplated by, this Agreement that are
expressly or otherwise required to be governed by the ICL, shall be governed
by the ICL. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company
agrees (a) that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in connection

 



     

 

 



 

with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be (i) governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to

with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts,
(b) not to bring or permit any of its affiliates or representatives to bring

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 10.11(b)_, the parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
hereto (on behalf of themselves and the third-party beneficiaries of this
Agreement provided in _Section 10.9_) shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in

Company seeking to collect Damages pursuant to _Article VIII_.

parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ 8.1_, the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to consummate the Closing
if, and only if: (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied) or

Section 10.16 _Shareholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) The parties have agreed that, effective as of the date of this Agreement,
it is desirable to designate the Shareholder Representative as a
representative to act on behalf of the Company Equityholders for certain
limited purposes, as specified herein. The approval of this Agreement by the
Company Equityholders shall constitute ratification and approval of such
designation. The Shareholder Representative may resign at any time, and the
Shareholder Representative may be removed by the vote of the holders of
Company Ordinary Shares which collectively hold at such time (or, following
the Closing, held immediately prior to the Effective Time) more than fifty
percent (50%) of the outstanding Company Ordinary Shares (the " ** _Majority
Equityholders_** "). In the event that the Shareholder Representative has
resigned or been removed, a new Shareholder Representative shall be appointed
by a vote of the Majority Equityholders, such appointment to become effective
upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Shareholder Representative.

 



 

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholder Representative shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Company Equityholders and CVR Holders,
except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Shareholder Representative shall have full power, authority and
discretion to (i) expend Shareholder Allocable Expenses, (ii) negotiate and
enter into amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on
behalf of the Company Equityholders and CVR Holders, and (iii) exercise on
behalf of the Company Equityholders and CVR Holders all rights granted to the
Shareholder Representative under _Section 3.7_, and (iv) act as a
representative of Parent Indemnifying Parties under _Section 9.5_. The
Shareholder Representative shall have no Liability to Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company (or, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company) or any
Company Equityholder or CVR Holder with respect to actions taken or omitted to
be taken in its capacity as the Shareholder Representative (except to Company
Equityholders and CVR Holders for those actions arising out of the Shareholder
Representatives bad faith or willful misconduct). The Shareholder
Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Majority Equityholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Shareholder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction,
and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as the
Shareholder Representative, unless the Shareholder Representative is holding
funds delivered to it under _Section 3.12_ and/or has been provided with
other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the
Shareholder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Shareholder
Representative against the costs, expenses and Liabilities which may be
incurred by the Shareholder Representative in responding to such direction or
taking such action. The Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to engage
such counsel, advisors, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall
deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its
function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
Shareholder Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the
opinions and advice of such Persons. The Shareholder Representative shall be
entitled to reimbursement from funds paid to it under _Section 3.12_,
released from the Adjustment Escrow Account for the benefit of the Company
Equityholders (other than Pathfinder) and CVR Holders and/or otherwise
received by it in its capacity as the Shareholder Representative pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel,

 



     

 

 



 

advisors, experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the
Shareholder Representative in such capacity, and shall be entitled to
indemnification (A) first, from funds paid to it under _Section 3.12_, and
(B) second, from the Company Equityholders (other than Pathfinder) and CVR
Holders against any loss, Liability or expenses arising out of actions taken
or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Shareholder Representative
(except for those arising out of the Shareholder Representatives bad faith or
willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and
defense of claims. In the event that the Shareholder Allocable Expenses exceed
the amount actually incurred by the Shareholder Representative in its capacity
as such, upon the final release of funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account
and shares from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall deliver (1) to the
Paying Agent (for payment to each holder of Company Ordinary Shares) a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (x) such excess amount,
multiplied by (y) the Ordinary Shares Percentage, (2) to the Surviving Company
(for payment to each Optionholder) a cash payment in an amount equal to the
product of (x) such excess amount, multiplied by (y) the Option Percentage and
(3) to ECI BV a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (x) such
excess amount _multiplied by_ (y) the CVR Percentage.

 



 

Section 10.17 _No Recourse to Related Parties_. No Person who is not party to
this Agreement, including any Related Party of the parties to this Agreement
and their respective Related Parties (in each case, other than the parties to
this Agreement themselves), shall have any liability (whether in contract or

action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with,
or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach, other than (i) the obligations of the Parent Indemnifying Parties
under _Article IX_ and (ii) the obligations of the parties thereto under the
Parent Voting Agreement, the Company Voting Agreement, the Stockholders
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Shareholders Representative shall not have any liability for
any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out
of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based
on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach other than for actions taken by the
Shareholders Representative in its capacity as such from and after the date
hereof, and subject to the limitation set forth in _Section 10.16_.

 



 

Section 10.18 _No Recourse to Financing Source Related Parties_. No Related
Party of the Company shall have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.18_ shall in any way limit or modify
