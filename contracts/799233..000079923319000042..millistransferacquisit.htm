ACQUISITION AND MERGER AGREEMENT

This Acquisition and Merger Agreement (this "Agreement") is executed and
delivered as of August 26, 2019, by and among (i) Heartland Express, Inc. of
Iowa, an Iowa corporation (the "Buyer"); (ii) Heartland Trucking, Inc., a
Wisconsin corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Merger Sub");
(ii) Midwest Holding Group, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation ("Midwest"); (iii)
Millis Real Estate Leasing, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company
("Millis" and with Midwest, collectively the "Companies" and each a "Company")
(the Companies with all Subsidiaries of Midwest collectively the "Entities"
and each an "Entity"); (iv) the Persons listed on the signature pages hereto
as the members of Millis (individually a "Seller" and collectively,
"Sellers"); David P. Millis, in capacity as Sellers\' Representative; and (v)
Heartland Express, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("Parent"), in its capacity as
guarantor. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings set forth in
Article 7 below or elsewhere in this Agreement.

WHEREAS, the Sellers own all of the membership interests in Millis (the
"Membership Interests"); and

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, (i) Buyer and
Midwest desire to cause the Merger Sub to merge with and into Midwest, with
Midwest as the surviving corporation and the Buyer as the sole owner of all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Midwest (the "Midwest Stock" and
with the "Membership Interests", the "Equity"), in exchange for the
consideration described herein, and (ii) Buyer desires to purchase from
Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, all
of the Membership Interests for the consideration described herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows.

ARTICLE 1 
MERGER, PURCHASE AND SALE

1.01 Merger, Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions in this
Agreement, at the Closing, the parties to this Agreement take the following
actions: (1) the Merger Sub is hereby merged with and into Midwest, with
Midwest as the surviving corporation, Buyer as the owner of all of the Midwest
Stock, and in consideration of the Merger Consideration (the "Merger"),
pursuant to that Plan of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Plan of
Merger"); (2) Buyer hereby purchases and acquires from Sellers, and each
Seller hereby sells, assigns, transfers and conveys to Buyer, all of the
Membership Interests owned by such Seller free and clear of all Liens, in
exchange for the Membership Interests Consideration. In furtherance of such
actions:

(a) at the Closing, Buyer will make payment of an amount equal to the
Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration, as follows:

(i) by wire transfer of immediately available funds in an amount equal to
$15,000,000 (the "Escrow Amount") to the Escrow Agent under the escrow
agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement") to be held in
an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") and released in accordance with such
Escrow Agreement;

(ii) by irrevocable instruction to the transfer agent of Parent\'s common
stock, $0.01 par value (the "Parent Common Stock"), in the form of the letter
attached as Exhibit C (the "Transfer Agent Instruction Letter"), to deliver
share certificates issued in the names of the Company Managers in accordance
with the allocation among such Company Managers set forth in Exhibit C
representing Parent Common Stock with a value equal to $750,000, valuing each
share at $20.00, provided the average closing price of Parent's Common Stock
on Nasdaq Global Select Market for the ten (10) trading days ending on the
trading day prior to the date hereof is between $18.00 and $22.00 (the
"Collar"). If the average closing price for such period is above or below the
Collar, the value of the Parent Common Stock will be adjusted up or down to
the close edge of the Collar; and

(iii) the balance of the Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Sellers' Representative, for
distribution to the account set forth on Exhibit D, for distribution to the
Owners.

(b) at the Closing, Sellers will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer
the Membership Interests representing 100% of the Membership Interests
together with duly executed letters of transmittal or transfer powers, in a
form reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

(c) at Closing, the Merger will have been consummated.

1.02 Calculation of Final Consideration.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Aggregate Closing Consideration"
means an amount equal to the result of: (i) the enterprise value of
$149,070,000 representing $144,250,000 to be paid in consideration to the
stockholders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in Midwest
immediately prior to the Merger (the "Shareholders" and with the Sellers,
collectively the "Owners") in exchange for the surrender of all of their
equity ownership interests in Midwest as a result of the Merger (the "Merger
Consideration"), $4,070,000 in exchange for the Membership Interests (the
"Membership Interests Consideration"), and $750,000 in Parent Common Stock to
the Company Managers for their acceptance of continued employment with Millis
Transfer, Inc. at Closing, subject to the holding requirements herein minus
(ii) the actual outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of 12:00:01 a.m.,
Central Time, on the Closing Date set forth on Schedule 1.02(a)(ii), minus
(iii) the actual amount of Transaction Expenses outstanding as of the Closing
Date after giving effect to the Closing plus (iv) the actual amount of any
Cash on Hand as of 12:00:01 a.m., Central Time, on the Closing Date, plus or
minus, as applicable (v) (A) plus the amount, if any, by which actual Net
Working Capital as of 12:00:01 a.m., Central Time, on the Closing Date exceeds
the Net Working Capital Target plus, or (B) minus the amount, if any, by which
actual Net Working Capital as of 12:00:01 a.m., Central Time, on the Closing
Date is less than the Net Working Capital Target. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) when calculating
the Aggregate Closing Consideration and Final Aggregate Closing Consideration
the calculations will be performed as if the Closing had not occurred, except
that the distribution of Seller Personal Property will have occurred and shall
not be taken into account in the calculation of the Aggregate Closing
Consideration, and the incurrence and payment of all Transaction Expenses
outstanding as of the Closing Date will be taken into consideration and (y)
the Sellers will cause Indebtedness as of the Closing to be not greater than
Indebtedness as of 12:00:01 a.m., Central Time, and Cash on Hand as of the
Closing to be not less than Cash on Hand as of 12:00:01 a.m., Central Time.
All adjustments pursuant to Section 1.02(a)(ii)-(v) will be adjustments to the
Merger Consideration.

(b) After the Closing and until Sellers' Representative has prepared, in
consultation with Buyer, and delivered the Closing Statement (as defined
below) to Buyer, Sellers\' Representative (or its agents or representatives)
will be permitted (upon reasonable advance written notice and during normal
business hours) to review each Entity's books and records and working papers
that are reasonably necessary for Sellers' Representative (or its agents or
representatives) to prepare the Closing Statement and determine the Aggregate
Closing Consideration (and the components thereof), and Buyer will provide
Sellers\' Representative (or its agents or representatives) with reasonable
access to each Entity's personnel, books and records, and facilities in
connection with such process. Subject to Buyer's compliance with its
obligations set forth in the preceding sentence, within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Sellers' Representative will deliver to Buyer a statement
setting forth Sellers' Representative's proposed calculation of the Final
Aggregate Closing Consideration with a comparison to the Estimated Aggregate
Closing Consideration, including Sellers' Representative's calculation of each
of the components thereof in sufficient detail to identify each item of
difference between the Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration and the Final
Aggregate Closing Consideration, including details regarding each component of
Indebtedness and each component of Transaction Expenses (the "Closing
Statement").

(c) The proposed Closing Statement delivered by Sellers' Representative to
Buyer will become final and binding on the parties thirty (30) days following
Sellers' Representative's delivery thereof to Buyer except to the extent (and
only to the extent) Buyer delivers written notice of its disagreement (the
"Closing Consideration Notice of Disagreement") to Sellers' Representative on
or prior to such date. All matters not subject to dispute as specifically
identified in the Closing Consideration Notice of Disagreement will be final
and binding. The Closing Consideration Notice of Disagreement must identify
with specificity each item in the Closing Statement that the Buyer disagrees
with and, for each disputed item, contain a statement describing in reasonable
detail the basis of such objection and the amount in dispute. If Buyer timely
delivers a Closing Consideration Notice of Disagreement, then such matters
will become final and binding on the parties to this Agreement on the earlier
of (i) the date Buyer and Sellers\' Representative resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Closing
Consideration Notice of Disagreement, and (ii) the date all matters in dispute
are finally resolved in writing by the Independent Accountants.

(d) During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Closing Consideration
Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and Sellers\' Representative will seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
the matters specified in the Closing Consideration Notice of Disagreement. At
the end of such thirty (30) day period, Buyer and Sellers\' Representative
will submit to the Independent Accountants for resolution all matters that
remain in dispute, which were included in the Closing Consideration Notice of
Disagreement (and will take all actions reasonably requested by the
Independent Accountants in connection with such resolution, including
submitting written claims to the Independent Accountants if so requested), and
the Independent Accountants will make a final determination of the Aggregate
Closing Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (with it
being understood that Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative will request that
the Independent Accountants deliver to Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative
its resolution in writing not more than thirty (30) days after its
engagement). The Independent Accountants will make a determination only with
respect to the matters still in dispute and, with respect to each such matter,
their determination will be within the range of the dispute between Buyer and
Sellers\' Representative. The Independent Accountants\' determination will be
based solely on written materials submitted by Buyer and Sellers\'
Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions of
"Aggregate Closing Consideration," "Indebtedness," "Cash on Hand,"
"Transaction Expenses," and "Net Working Capital" (and related definitions)
included herein and the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants will be allocated
between Buyer and Sellers' Representative based upon the percentage of the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to Buyer or Sellers bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. For example, if Sellers\'
Representative claims the actual Aggregate Closing Consideration is $1,000
greater than the amount claimed by Buyer, and Buyer contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by Sellers\' Representative, and if the Independent Accountants
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Sellers $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Sellers'
Representative.

(f) If the Aggregate Closing Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 1.02 (the "Final Aggregate Closing Consideration") is greater
than the Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration by more than the amount set
forth on Schedule 1.02(f) (the "NWC Variance"), then, within three (3)
Business Days after the date on which the Final Aggregate Closing
Consideration is determined, Buyer will pay to Sellers' Representative, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified on
Exhibit D, the amount of such difference (the "Underpayment").

(g) If the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration by more than the NWC Variance, then, within
three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final Aggregate Closing
Consideration is determined, Buyer and Sellers' Representative will deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Buyer from the Escrow Account the amount of such difference (the
"Overpayment").

(h) The dispute resolution provisions provided in this Section 1.02 will be
the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed or that could be addressed
therein. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, none of the Owners will have any obligation to fund or
otherwise replenish the Escrow Account.

(i) All payments required pursuant to Sections 1.02(f) and 1.02(g) will be
deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase price paid
by Buyer for the Equity.

(j) The provisions of this Section 1.02 will apply in such a manner so as not
to give the components and calculations duplicative effect to any item of
adjustment and no amount will be (or is intended to be) included in whole or
in part (either as an increase or reduction) more than once in calculation of
(including any component of) Aggregate Closing Consideration or any other
calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional
inclusion (either as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount
to be overstated or understated for purposes of such calculation.

1.03 The Closing. The closing of the Merger and the purchase and sale of the
Membership Interests and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") will occur simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing
Date"). The Closing will be deemed completed as of 12:00:01 a.m., Central
Time, on the Closing Date.

1.04 Closing Deliveries by the Entities and Sellers. At or prior to the
Closing, the Entities, the Sellers' Representative and Sellers, as the case
may be, will deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer the following
documents, each of which will be in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer:

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MIDWEST AND THE SELLERS

Except as otherwise set forth in the disclosure schedules attached to this

its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy laws, other
similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and general principles of equity
affecting the availability of equitable remedies. Each other Seller
Transaction Document to which an Owner is a party, when executed and delivered
by such Owner, will be duly executed and delivered by that Owner, and assuming
that such other Seller Transaction Documents are valid and binding obligations
of the other parties thereto, each Seller Transaction Document will constitute
a valid and binding obligation of each Owner, enforceable against each Owner
in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy laws, other similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and general
principles of equity affecting the availability of equitable remedies.

2.03 No Conflicts; Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.03, the
execution, delivery and performance by each Owner of the Seller Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby by
each Owner do not conflict with or result in any breach of, constitute a
default under, result in a violation of, result in the creation of any Lien
upon any material assets of that Owner, including the Equity owned by each
Owner, or require any authorization, consent, approval or other action by or
notice to any Governmental Authority or other third party, or any agreement or
instrument to which such Owner is bound, or any law, statute, rule or
regulation or order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority to which such Owner or any of its properties or assets is subject.
Each Owner is not a party to any litigation, claims, actions or other
proceeding, or any outstanding judgment, order or decree of any Governmental
Authority or arbitration or mediation authority, that reasonably could be
expected to affect or delay the ability of such Owner to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to such Seller\'s Knowledge, no such
litigation, claim, action or other proceeding is threatened against that
Owner.

2.04 Title. Each Seller is the record and beneficial owner of the Millis
Membership Interests set forth opposite its name on Schedule 2.04, free and
clear of any Liens. Immediately prior to the Merger, each Owner is the record
and beneficial owner of the Midwest Stock set forth opposite its name on
Schedule 2.04, free and clear of any Liens. Except as set forth on Schedule
2.04, no Owner is a party to any Option, voting agreement, proxy or other
agreement, contract or commitment (other than this Agreement) that could
require such Owner or, after the Closing, Buyer, to vote, sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of, or affect the voting of, any ownership interest of any
Entity. Except for the Equity owned by each Owner and listed on Schedule 2.04,
no Owner owns any Equity or any Entity or any Options. At the Closing, each
Seller is transferring to Buyer, and Buyer is acquiring from such Seller, good
title to the Membership Interests free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Liens.

2.05 Brokerage. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20, there are no claims for

forth on Schedule 2.06, no Owner (i) is a party to any agreement or
transaction with any Entity and (ii) has any interest in any asset or right of
any Entity, or any asset used in the business of any Entity (whether tangible
or intangible, including, but not limited to, any Software, know-how, trade
secret, or other Intellectual Property).

2.07 Company Managers\' Investment Intent. Each Company Manager represents and
warrants to Buyer that such Company Manager has such knowledge, sophistication
and experience in financial and business matters that such Company Manager is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of receipt of Parent Common Stock
and of protecting such Company Manager's interests in connection herewith.
Such Company Manager has the ability to bear the economic risk of this
investment, including complete loss of the investment. Each Company Manager
represents and warrants to Buyer that such Company Manager is acquiring Buyer
stock for investment for its own account, not as nominee or agent, and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof,
and has no present intent of selling, granting any participation in or
otherwise distributing the same. Such Company Manager understands that Parent
Common Stock received pursuant to Section 1.01(a) has not been registered
under the Securities Act, by reason of a specific exemption from the
registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other
things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of such
Company Manager's representations contained in this Section 2.07. Each Company
Manager acknowledges that, as of the date hereof, it has been afforded (i) the
opportunity to ask such questions as it has deemed necessary of, and to
receive answers from, representatives of Buyer concerning the terms and
conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Parent
Common Stock, and the merits and risks of investing in Parent Common Stock,
and any such questions have been answered to such Company Manager's reasonable
satisfaction; (ii) access to information about Buyer and its financial
condition, results of operations, business, properties, management and
prospects sufficient to enable such Company Manager's evaluation of its
investment; (iii) the opportunity to obtain such additional information that
Buyer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is
necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to the
investment and any such additional information has been provided to such
Company Manager's reasonable satisfaction; and (iv) the opportunity to ask
questions of management of Buyer and any such questions have been answered to
such Company Manager's reasonable satisfaction. Each Company Manager has
sought accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered necessary to make
an informed decision with respect to its acquisition of the Parent Common
Stock. Each Company Manager acknowledges that no Affiliate or representative
of Buyer has made any representations, express or implied, with respect to the
accuracy, completeness or adequacy of any available information. Each Company
Manager agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will have any
indemnification obligation hereunder to such Company Manager or any other
Person resulting from the issuance and sale of Parent Common Stock to such
Company Manager. Each Company Manager represents and warrants to Buyer that it
is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a),
promulgated by the SEC. Each Company Manager represents and warrants to Buyer
that it understands that the Parent Common Stock is characterized as
"restricted securities" under the United States federal securities laws
inasmuch as such Parent Common Stock is being acquired from Buyer in a
transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and
applicable regulations the Parent Common Stock may be resold without
registration under the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances.
Each Company Manager acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock must be held
indefinitely unless a sale of such Parent Common Stock is subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available. Each Company Manager is aware of the provisions of Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act which permit limited resale of shares
purchased in a private placement or shares owned by certain Persons associated
with Buyer subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Each Company Manager
understands and agrees that each certificate representing Parent Common Stock,
any securities issued in respect thereof or exchange therefor will bear a
legend in the following form (in addition to any other legend required under
applicable state securities laws) (and a comparable notation or other
arrangement will be made with respect to any uncertificated Parent Common
Stock):

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR UNLESS THE ISSUER RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO IT STATING THAT SUCH SALE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM THE
REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT. THE SECURITIES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO HOLDING PERIODS AND CERTAIN
RESTRICTIONS ON SALE CONTAINED IN THAT CERTAIN ACQUISITION AND MERGER
AGREEMENT DATED AUGUST 26, 2019, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD IN VIOLATION OF SUCH
RESTRICTIONS."

(a) Schedule 3.06(a) consists of: (i) each Company's unaudited, and with
respect to Midwest, consolidated, internal balance sheets as of June 29, 2019
(the "Latest Balance Sheets") and the related internal statements of income
for the respective twelve-month period then ended, (the "Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements"), and (ii) each Company's audited, other than Millis's,

Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated

respect thereof pursuant to this Article 5 will survive the Closing, but will
terminate and be of no further force or effect after the date eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing (a) the representations set forth in Section 3.18 (Environmental

Article 4, (b) nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer
contained in this Agreement and (c) nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant
or agreement of any Entity requiring performance by such Entity after the

5.03 Indemnification by Sellers.

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this Article
5), the Sellers (and each Restricted Person, as applicable) will, severally
and not jointly, indemnify Buyer, each Entity, each of Buyer\'s and each
Entity's respective Affiliates and representatives (all such foregoing
persons, collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") and hold the Buyer Indemnitees
harmless from any Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee to the extent such
Loss results from:

(i) fraud or intentional misconduct by such Owner; or

(ii) breach by the Restricted Person of his or her obligations under Section
6.04 (it being understood that the obligation to indemnify under this clause
(ii) will be an obligation of both a breaching Restricted Person and such
Restricted Person as an Owner (but only to the extent of such Restricted
Person's maximum liability as an Owner in accordance with Section
5.04(b)(iii)).

The right of the Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification under this Section
5.03(a) and to claim against the Escrow Account or, if the Escrow Account is
depleted, withhold shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d),
or, if withholding of such shares is unavailable, to otherwise seek
indemnification as permitted by this Agreement, will be in addition to all
other rights of the Buyer Indemnitees.

(b) From and after the Closing, the Owners will, jointly and severally (but
subject to any applicable aggregate and individual limitations set forth in
Section 5.04(b)), indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees and hold the Buyer
Indemnitees harmless from any Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee to the
extent such Loss results from:

(i) fraud or intentional misconduct by any Entity;

(ii) a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
Article 2 or Article 3; provided, however, that, solely for purposes of
calculating any Losses (but not for determining whether any breach of a
representation or warranty has occurred), if any such representation is
qualified by the use of the term "Material Adverse Effect" or by the word
"material" or by any word formed from such words, then such representation or
warranty will be construed as if the word "material" (and such words formed
therefrom) or the term "Material Adverse Effect" were not included in such
representation or warranty;

(iii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of any Entity
(required to be performed prior to or at the Closing) or any Seller, any
Owner, or the Sellers\' Representative (required to be performed at any time)
contained in this Agreement;

(iv) any Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses not paid at or prior to the
Closing and not taken into account in determining the Final Aggregate Closing
Consideration;

(v) any obligation of any Entity to any Owner or any Affiliate of any Owner
(other than any other Entity) for events, circumstances, actions, omissions,
or liabilities arising prior to the Closing Date under any contract,
agreement, arrangement, lease, or other understanding between any Entity, on
the one hand, and any Owner or any Affiliate of any Owner, on the other hand
(including, without limitation, any obligation under any lease of Real
Property relating to any environmental condition existing on such Real
Property prior to the Closing Date);

(vi) any Seller Taxes; or

(vii) the matters described on Schedule 5.03(b)(vii), if any.

The right of the Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification under this Section
5.03(b) and to claim against the Escrow Account or, if the Escrow Account is
depleted, withhold shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d),
or, if withholding of such shares is unavailable, to otherwise seek
indemnification as permitted by this Agreement, will be in addition to all
other rights of the Buyer Indemnitees.

5.04 Escrow; Indemnification Matters.

(a) At any time and from time to time after the Closing, the Buyer Indemnitees
will be entitled to make claims against the Escrow Account and, if the Escrow
Account is depleted, withhold shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 5.04(d), in respect of Losses for which they are indemnified hereunder
and, except as set forth in Section 5.07, release from the Escrow Account and,
if the Escrow Account is depleted, withholding of shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d), will be the Buyer\'s sole remedy for
indemnification under Section 5.03(b)(ii) relating solely to Article 3.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of Buyer
pursuant to this Article 5 will be subject to the following limitations:

(i) no Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 5.03(b)(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that
otherwise would be payable pursuant to Section 5.03(b)(ii) to any one or more
Buyer Indemnitees exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,000,000
(the "Threshold") and then the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to the
aggregate amount of all such Losses that exceed the sum of $500,000, including
those Losses included in calculating the Threshold; provided, however, that
the limitation set forth in this Section 5.04(b)(i) will not apply to Losses
resulting from (I) fraud or intentional misconduct (by any Entity or any
Owner), (II) a breach or inaccuracy by any Owner or any Entity of any of the
Fundamental Representations, (III) a breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant
or agreement of any Entity (required to be performed prior to or at the
Closing) or any Seller, any Owner, or the Sellers\' Representative contained
in this Agreement, (IV) any amounts required to pay any Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses not paid at or prior to the Closing and not taken into
account in determining the Aggregate Closing Consideration and (V) any Seller
Taxes;

(ii) the amount that the Buyer Indemnitees may recover with respect to any and
all Losses (x) under Section 5.03(b)(ii) (excluding Losses that result from a
breach or inaccuracy of any of the Special Representations) will not exceed,
in the aggregate, $15,000,000, and (y) under Section 5.03(b)(ii) where arising
from Losses that result from a breach or inaccuracy of any of the Special
Representations will not exceed, in the aggregate, $25,000,000; and

(iii) the amount that the Buyer Indemnitees may recover from any individual
Owner or Restricted Person, in excess of claims against the Escrow Account and
the withholding of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d),
shall in no circumstances exceed the amount of the Final Aggregate Closing
Consideration actually received by such individual Owner or Restricted Person,
net of any tax obligations of such Owner or Restricted Person resulting from
the receipt of any of the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration received by
such Owner or Restricted Person, except in the event of breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations by such individual Owner or Restricted Person or
any fraud or willful misconduct by such individual Owner or Restricted Person.

The limitations contained in Section 5.04(b)(i) and Section 5.04(b)(ii) will
not apply to Losses relating to Sections 5.03(a)(ii), 5.03(b)(i),
5.03(b)(iii), 5.03(b)(iv), 5.03(b)(v), 5.03(b)(vi), 5.03(b)(vii), breach of
any of the Fundamental Representations or to any fraud or willful misconduct.

(c) On the dates set forth on Schedule 5.04(c) (each such date a "Release
Date"), Buyer and Sellers\' Representative will deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to distribute to
the Sellers' Representative, for distribution to the Owners, the amounts set
forth on Schedule 5.04(c); provided, the amount released on any Release Date
will be reduced by the amount for which Buyer Indemnitees will have made valid
claims pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article 5 and for which
recovery will not have been satisfied from the Escrow Account (the
"Outstanding Escrow Claims"). As soon as any Outstanding Escrow Claim that is
unresolved as of the next Business Day following the date thirty-six (36)
months after the Closing Date (the "Final Release Date") is resolved pursuant
to the procedures set forth in this Article 5 and the amount of the
Outstanding Escrow Claims is delivered to the Buyer Indemnitees in respect of
such resolved Outstanding Escrow Claim, Buyer and Sellers' Representative will
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow
Agent to distribute to the Sellers' Representative, for distribution to the
Owners, the remaining amount held in the Escrow Account, less any unresolved
Outstanding Escrow Claims.

(d) If the Escrow Account is depleted on or prior to the Final Release Date or
if Buyer Indemnitees have made valid claims pursuant to the procedures set
forth in this Article 5 in excess of amounts then-held in the Escrow Account,
the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to withhold shares of Parent Common
Stock for which the holding period set forth in Section 6.06(a) has not been
met to satisfy claims in respect of Losses for which they are indemnified
hereunder. The number of such shares withheld will be determined by dividing
the amount of any such claim by the Fair Market Value of the Parent Common
Stock determined as of the date such claim is asserted.

(e) All payments made from the Escrow Account, shares of Parent Common Stock
withheld pursuant to Section 5.04(d), or otherwise will be deemed to be
adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase price paid by Buyer for
the Equity.

(f) Except for Buyer pursuant to Section 1.01(a)(i), no Person will have any
obligation to fund or replenish the Escrow Account at any time.

5.05 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this Article 5, in order
for any Person (such Person the "Claiming Party") to be entitled to
indemnification or recovery under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person against the Claiming Party (a "Third Party Claim"),
such Claiming Party will notify the Buyer (in cases of claims for
indemnification under Section 5.02) or the Sellers\' Representative (in cases
of claims for indemnification under Section 5.03) (in either case, the
"Defending Party") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party
Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such Claiming Party
of notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give
such notification on a timely basis will not affect the indemnification or
escrow recovery, or withholding of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 5.04(d), as applicable, provided hereunder except to the extent the
Defending Party will have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result
of such failure. Thereafter, the Claiming Party will deliver to the Defending
Party, reasonably promptly after the Claiming Party\'s receipt thereof, copies
of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Claiming
Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the Defending
Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so
chooses, to assume the defense thereof with reputable counsel selected by the
Defending Party, so long as the requirements of this Section 5.05(b) remain
true: (i) the Defending Party notifies the Claiming Party within thirty (30)
days after the Claiming Party has given written notice of a Third Party Claim
to the Defending Party (unless in such notice the Claiming Party certifies, in
good faith, that the failure to assume such defense within fifteen (15) days
would materially prejudice the Claiming Party by a delay in assuming the
defense beyond fifteen (15) days, in which case, the Claiming Party will have
the right to assume the defense subsequent to the expiration of such fifteen
(15) day period if the Defending Party fails to so assume the defense
thereof), that the Defending Party is assuming the defense of such Third Party
Claim; and (ii) the Defending Party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim in an active and diligent manner; provided, however, that the Defending
Party will not be entitled to assume the defense (unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the Claiming Party) if (x) the Third Party Claim relates to any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or (y)
the Third Party Claim primarily seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Claiming Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Defending Party
will not be entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim unless it
has acknowledged in writing to the Claiming Party that indemnification or
recovery from the Escrow Account or withholding of shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d) applies to such Third Party Claim. Should a
Defending Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Defending Party will not be liable to the Claiming Party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Claiming Party in connection with the defense
thereof unless (I) the employment of separate counsel will have been
authorized in writing by the Defending Party in connection with the defense of
such Third Party Claim or (II) the Claiming Party\'s counsel will have advised
the Claiming Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Defending Party,
that there is a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel. If the
Defending Party assumes such defense, the Claiming Party will have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Defending Party, it being
understood, however, that the Defending Party will control such defense
(including any settlement with respect thereto); provided, however, that the
Defending Party will obtain the prior written consent of the Claiming Party
(which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the
validity of the Third Party Claim if such resolution would involve anything
other than the payment of monetary damages in an amount less than the amount
remaining in the Escrow Account and does not include an unconditional
provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the
Claiming Party and all of its Affiliates and representatives from all
liability with respect thereto. If the Defending Party chooses to defend any
Third Party Claim, then all the parties hereto will cooperate in the defense
or prosecution of such Third Party Claim, including by retaining and (upon the
Defending Party\'s request) providing to the Defending Party all records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Sellers\' Representative will act on behalf of all Defending Parties in the
case of all Third Party Claims with respect to which Buyer is seeking
indemnification pursuant to Section 5.03(b) or funds from the Escrow Account
under Section 5.04 or withholding of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 5.04(d). Whether or not Sellers\' Representative will have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any
Third Party Claim for which any sums are recoverable from the Escrow Account
or withholding of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d)
without the prior written consent of Sellers\' Representative (which will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) In any case in which a Claiming Party seeks indemnification or recovery
from the Escrow Account or withholding of shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 5.04(d) under this Agreement not arising out of a Third
Party Claim, the Claiming Party will notify the Defending Party in writing of
any Losses that such Claiming Party claims are subject to indemnification or
recovery from the Escrow Account or withholding of shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d) under the terms of this Agreement. The
notice will describe the indemnification sought in reasonable detail to the
extent known, and will indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary, and if
then estimable) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered. Subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 5.04(a) and this Section 5.05, the failure of
the Claiming Party to exercise promptness in such notification will not amount
to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that the resulting
delay actually materially and adversely prejudices the position of the
Defending Party with respect to such claim.

5.06 Determination of Loss Amount.

(a) Any Losses claimed hereunder will be calculated after taking into
consideration the net proceeds (after taking into account the costs of
collecting any such proceeds) of insurance or third party recoveries actually
received by any Person entitled to indemnification or escrow recovery or
withholding of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.04(d), as
applicable. In the event that any such net proceeds of insurance or other
third party recovery is made by any such Person with respect to any Loss for
which any such Person already has been indemnified or otherwise recovered
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate net amount of the recovery
from the insurance or other third party recovery will be made promptly to the
Person providing the indemnity or other recovery hereunder. Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with Buyer's past practices, to
submit claims to insurance companies for Losses covered by insurance policies
of each Entity or of Buyer. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts,
consistent with the Buyer\'s past practices, to submit claims and seek
indemnification from any third party Person (except insurance companies as
discussed in the previous sentence) who may have an obligation to indemnify
Buyer, its Affiliates, or each Entity against any such Losses. To the extent
consistent with Buyer's past practices, Buyer's obligation to use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding sentences of
this Section 5.06(a) may include an obligation of Buyer to file suit or
initiate litigation, mediation or other proceedings against an insurance
company or other third party Person to secure such recovery. Buyer will not be
required to file suit or initiate litigation, mediation, or other proceeding
against any insurance company or Person.

(b) In no event will any Person be entitled to recover or make a claim for any
amounts in respect of consequential, punitive or exemplary damages (except to
the extent payable in connection with a Third Party Claim). In addition, no
Loss will be calculated as a multiple of lost revenues or profits of Buyer (or
its Affiliates).

(c) No Person will be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity hereunder more than once in respect of
any one Loss or related group of Losses. For example, Buyer Indemnitees will
not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment, reimbursement,
restitution or indemnity hereunder with respect to any Loss arising from a
breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Article 3 relating in any
way to each Entity's Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, Cash on Hand or Net
Working Capital to the extent such Loss is factored into the amount of

are included in the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration.

5.07 Acknowledgments.

(a) With respect to claims under Section 5.03(b)(ii), except for claims
relating to breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or to any fraud
or willful misconduct, the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to seek
payment directly from any Seller with respect to any indemnification claim
under this Agreement unless the Escrow Amount has been entirely released from
the Escrow Account or is entirely reserved for other pending indemnification
claims under this Article 5, and all then-available shares of Parent Common
Stock have been withheld pursuant to Section 5.04(d); provided, such attempts
to seek payment from any Seller shall be subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 5.04(b).

(b) Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement (including in
Section 1.02), this Article 5 and the Escrow Agreement set forth the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all rights, claims and causes of

whether arising under or based upon any law or otherwise (including any right,
whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution,
cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy, including as may
arise under common law). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, the liability of any Owner or Seller under
the indemnification, set-off, and escrow recovery provisions set forth in this
Article 5 will be in addition to, and not exclusive of, (i) any other
liability that such Person may have at law or equity due to the fraud or
willful misconduct of such Person (and none of the provisions set forth in

other Person); and (ii) any equitable relief to which a Person may be entitled
relating to the breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this

occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former

individual indemnity agreements, board resolutions or otherwise, in each case
to the limited extent set forth in the data room relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will survive the Closing and the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, but solely with respect to claims by Persons
other than (i) the parties to this Agreement, (ii) related Persons of the

ARTICLE 6 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.01 Tax Matters.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.01(a), Buyer will prepare
or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of each Entity required to be filed
after the Closing Date for all Pre-Closing Periods and all Straddle Periods,
including, without limitation, all income Tax Returns of each Entity filed or
required to be filed after the Closing Date ("Income Tax Returns") for all
Pre-Closing Periods. Such Tax Returns will be prepared in compliance with
applicable law. At least ten (10) days prior to the date on which each such
Tax Return is to be filed (taking into account any validly obtained extensions
of time to file), Buyer will submit such Tax Return to Sellers\'
Representative for review and approval, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Buyer will cause such Tax Return to be
timely filed and will provide a copy to the Sellers\' Representative.

(b) In completing any Income Tax Returns for the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and any Straddle Period, the Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses
and any other applicable expenses of each Entity associated with the
transactions contemplated hereby will, to the extent properly deductible for
federal or applicable state and local income tax purposes as determined by
Buyer in its reasonable discretion, be allocated to such Income Tax Returns.

(c) In the case of such Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is attributable to the portion of
the period ending on the Closing Date will be:

(i) in the case of Taxes other than those imposed on a periodic basis with
respect to the assets or capital of any Entity deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the Tax period of such Entity ended with (and included)
the Closing Date; provided, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) will be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of each Entity, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the portion of the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

(d) Buyer, each Entity, Sellers\' Representative and Sellers will cooperate,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other party, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or this Section
6.01(d) and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each, a "Tax
Proceeding") with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets,
operations or activities of each Entity. Each of the Sellers\' Representative
and Buyer agrees, upon request of the other, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other documentation from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Buyer, any Entity or Sellers,
including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that the Sellers\' Representative will not be
required to take any action that would impose or increase any obligation on
the part of the Sellers, or create or increase any claim against the Escrow
Account unless Buyer states in writing to the Sellers' Representative in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Sellers' Representative that as a result of
Buyer requiring the action by Sellers' Representative, Buyer will not make any
claim against the Escrow Account for any increase in cash Tax liability
directly related to the increase in cash Tax liability that arises as a result
of the action required of the Sellers' Representative by the Buyer under this
Section 6.01(d). Each Entity and Sellers will (i) retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each Entity relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii)
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, each Entity or the Sellers, as the case may be, will allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records.

(e) Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or its Affiliates (including
the Entities after the Closing), and any amounts credited against Taxes to
which Buyer or its Affiliates may become entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing
Periods or portions thereof ending on the Closing Date for any Straddle Period
will be for the account of Buyer; provided that any refunds of Alternative
Minimum Tax credit received under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 received
with respect to Pre-Closing Periods will be retained fifty percent (50%) by
Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers. Buyer will pay to Sellers'
Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified on Exhibit D, for distribution to the Owners, fifty percent (50%)
any such refunds of Alternative Minimum Tax credit within five (5) days after
receipt. If any such refunds of Alternative Minimum Tax credit are
subsequently disallowed, the Taxes payable by each Entity in connection with
the disallowance of such refund will be treated as Seller Taxes subject to
indemnification or escrow recovery or withholding of shares of Parent Common
Stock under Section 5.04.

(f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or other
similar Taxes imposed on any Entity or Sellers directly or indirectly as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer
Taxes will be borne fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by
Buyer. The Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate in
the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including
promptly supplying information in their possession that is reasonably
necessary to complete such Tax Returns. Sellers\' portion of such Transfer
Taxes will be paid from the Aggregate Closing Consideration and will be
retained by Buyer at Closing for such purposes.

(g) If, subsequent to the Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Entities after the Closing) receives notice of a Tax Proceeding with
respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle Period,
then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, Buyer will
promptly notify the Sellers' Representative of such notice in writing. Buyer
will have the right to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax
Proceeding, provided, that Buyer (i) will keep Sellers' Representative
reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax Proceeding and (ii) will not
effect any settlement or compromise of any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining Sellers' Representative's prior written consent thereto, which will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such settlement or
compromise could reasonably be expected to increase the liability for Taxes of
Sellers or for which the Sellers are responsible under this Agreement, and
provided, further, that Sellers' Representative will have the right to
participate, at Sellers' expense, in the conduct and resolution of any such
Tax Proceeding. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions
of this Section 6.01(g) and Section 5.05, the provisions of this Section
6.01(g) will control.

6.02 Further Assurances. From time to time from and after the Closing, as and
when reasonably requested by any party hereto and at such requesting party\'s
expense, any other party will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take, or cause to be
taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting party may
reasonably deem necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.03 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing, Buyer will cause
the Entities to provide the Sellers\' Representative and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying) during normal business hours (and without causing undue interruption
or interference with any Entity's business) and with advance written notice to
Buyer, to the books and records of each Entity with respect to periods or
occurrences prior to the Closing Date for any reasonable purpose relating to
this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers\' Representative and its authorized representatives are not entitled
to access, review, examine or copy any books and records of any Entity
containing any confidential information the disclosure of which is prohibited
under a confidentiality or similar agreement with a third party or privileged
(including attorney-client privilege) information unless in the case of
confidential information that is not privileged (including attorney-client
privilege) information such confidential information is reasonably necessary
to the Sellers' Representative's duties relating to this Agreement and the
Sellers' Representative has executed a confidentiality agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Entity. Unless otherwise consented
to in writing by Sellers\' Representative, Buyer will not, and Buyer will not
permit any Entity, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date,
destroy or otherwise dispose of any books or records of the Entities, or any
portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first
giving reasonable prior notice to Sellers and offering to surrender to
Sellers\' Representative such books and records or such portions thereof.

6.04 Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Non-Disclosure.

(a) The parties hereto have negotiated the non-competition and non-
solicitation provisions contained in this Section 6.04 as an integral part of
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. Each Restricted Person
acknowledges that he or she is a Seller or a beneficiary of a Seller and will
receive substantial benefits from the payment of the Aggregate Closing
Consideration and the performance of other obligations hereunder by Buyer (and
the Entities after the Closing) and acknowledges that Buyer is willing to pay
the Aggregate Closing Consideration and proceed with the transactions
contemplated hereby because of the customer, driver, contractor, employee and
agent relationships of each of the Entities, and that the same may be severely
and irreparably harmed by competition from such Restricted Person. Each
Restricted Person further acknowledges that Buyer would not have entered into
this Agreement and consummated the transactions contemplated hereby without
the non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disclosure provisions contained
herein. The Restricted Persons agree that the non-competition, non-
solicitation and non-disclosure provisions are reasonable and necessary to
induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) In consideration of the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby,
but subject to the further provisions of this Section 6.04, each Restricted
Person, severally and not jointly, agrees that, for the applicable Restricted
Period (as hereinafter defined) he or she will not, and his or her respective
Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly through another Person, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which may be withheld in Buyer\'s sole and
absolute discretion: (i) directly or indirectly through another Person engage
or invest in, own, manage, operate, finance, control or participate in the
ownership, management, operation, financing or control of, be employed by,
serve as an agent, officer, director or consultant to, be associated with or
in any manner connected with, lend his or her name or any similar name to,
lend his or her credit or render services or advice to, any Competitive
Business (as hereinafter defined) anywhere in North America, provided,
however, that nothing herein will be deemed to prevent any Restricted Person
from acquiring through market purchases and owning, solely as an investment,
less than one percent (1%) in the aggregate of the equity securities of any
issuer, other than Buyer, whose shares are registered under Section 12(b) or
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, as amended, and are listed or admitted for
trading on any United States national securities exchange or are quoted on any
system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices in common
use, so long as such Restricted Person is not directly or indirectly a member
of any "control group" (within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the
SEC) or any such issuer, other than Buyer; (ii) whether for a Restricted
Person\'s own account or for the account of another Person, solicit any Person
that is or was a customer of any Entity, Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
of any Entity or Buyer; (iii) whether for a Restricted Person\'s own account
or the account of any other Person, solicit, employ or otherwise engage as an
employee, independent contractor, agent or otherwise, any Person who is or was
an employee, independent contractor, agent or otherwise engaged with any
Entity, Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Entity or Buyer to
terminate his, her or its employment, engagement or relationship with any
Entity, Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Entity or Buyer; (iv) at
any time interfere with any Entity\'s or Buyer\'s relationship with any
Person, including any Person who was an employee, contractor, supplier, agent
or customer of any Entity, Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Entity
or Buyer, including, without limitation, soliciting, encouraging, advising or
influencing such Person(s) to discontinue or reduce the extent of such
relationship; (v) disparage any Entity, Buyer, or any of their Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents; or (vi)
divulge, communicate, use to the detriment of any Entity, Buyer or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Entity or Buyer or for the benefit of any other
Person(s), or misuse in any way, any confidential information or trade secrets
pertaining to any Entity, Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Entity
or Buyer.

(c) Each Restricted Person acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered
by Buyer as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Section 6.04 would
be irreparable and that the award of monetary damages for such breach would be
an inadequate remedy. Consequently, Buyer will have the right, in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive
relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to
specifically enforce any provisions of this Section 6.04, and Buyer will not
be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief.

(d) The covenants set forth in this Section 6.04 will be deemed and construed
as a separate agreement independent of any other provisions of this Agreement
or any other agreement between Buyer and a Restricted Person or any Affiliate
of a Restricted Person. The existence of any claim or cause of action by a
Restricted Person (directly or indirectly), whether predicated on this
Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by
Buyer of the covenants of this Section 6.04.

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.04, "Competitive Business" means (i) the
interstate or intrastate transportation of freight by truck (motor carrier)
and/or arranging for the interstate or intrastate transportation of freight by
truck (brokerage), in each case using dry van, flat bed, or refrigerated
trailers, and specifically including any business conducted by any Entity or
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, Buyer, or Buyer's Subsidiaries or Affiliates
as of or within six (6) months prior to the Closing Date and (ii) any business
in which any Entity, or Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Entity, the Buyer, or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Buyer, is engaged at or within six (6)
months prior to the time the applicable Restricted Person's employment with
any Entity or Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, terminates (or the Closing
Date, if the Restricted Person has not been such an employee), which may
include, without limitation, any extension of any business described in clause
(e)(i). In addition, for purposes of the Agreement, (A) "Restricted Person"
means each of the Company Managers (acting directly or indirectly) and the
Company Employees (acting directly or indirectly), (B) "Restricted Period"
means (1) with respect to each Company Employee, the five (5)-year anniversary
of the Closing Date and (2) with respect to each of the Company Managers, the
longer of (x) the ten (10)-year anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) three
(3) years from the date his employment with Buyer, any Entity or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates ceases.

6.05 Repayment of Guarantied Obligations; Release of Guaranties.

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer will either (i) cause the Sellers and
their post-Closing Affiliates to be released from all personal guaranties
under, or (ii) cause to be repaid without any liability on the part of the
Sellers and their post-Closing Affiliates, all of the Indebtedness of each
Entity and each Entity's Subsidiaries included in the calculation of Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration, which Indebtedness has been personally
guaranteed by any Seller or their Affiliates, and indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Seller and their post-Closing Affiliates from and against any
and all claims made against such Person in connection with any such
guaranties.

(b) At or prior to Closing, Sellers will have caused each Entity and each
Entity's Subsidiaries to be released from all guaranties and other obligations
(and any related pledge or security agreements) pursuant to documentation
satisfactory to Buyer in its discretion, relating to all Indebtedness other
than Indebtedness taken into consideration in the calculation of Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration and Indebtedness associated with Permitted
Liens.

6.06 Holding Period for Parent Common Stock.

(a) In addition to any holding period that may be required by law (including
Rule 144 under the Securities Act), each Company Manager agrees and
acknowledges that he must retain beneficial ownership of, and the full
pecuniary interest (without any hedging or similar transaction) in, (i) all of
Parent Common Stock received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the
date six (6) months after the Closing Date, (ii) two-thirds of Parent Common
Stock received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, and (iii) one-third of Parent Common Stock
received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.06(a), the share
holding requirements and restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 6.06(a)
will not prohibit or in any way limit a Company Manager's right to effect
(subject to any restrictions on transfer imposed generally by applicable
securities laws, blackout policies of Parent, and restrictions on insider
trading), (i) any transfer or sale of Parent Common Stock in connection with
or upon the announcement of a Change in Control approved by the Parent's board
of directors, including by way of merger, tender offer, or otherwise, (ii) any
sale of Parent Common Stock to Parent in connection with and pursuant to the
terms of a stock repurchase program approved by Parent's board of directors,
provided, that each Company Manager may sell only a percentage of his or her
Parent Common Stock equal to the percentage of total outstanding Parent Common
Stock that is subject to such stock repurchase program, or (iii) any transfer
of Parent Common Stock from a Company Manager to any member or members of such
Company Manager's Immediate Family or to a trust, family limited partnership,
family limited liability company or other bona fide estate planning or planned
gifting vehicle for the benefit of such Company Manager or one or more members
of such Company Manager's Immediate Family (including, without limitation, any
such permitted transfer by beneficiary designation, will or intestate
succession); provided, such Immediate Family member, entity or estate planning
vehicle agrees to be bound by the share retention obligations set forth in
this Agreement and not to transfer or sell any of such shares unless following
such sale or transfer such Immediate Family member, entity or estate planning
vehicle, when considered together with such Company Manager, would
collectively hold sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to comply with the
holding requirements set forth above in this Section 6.06 (each of clauses (i)
through (iii) being a "Permitted Transfer"). If a Company Manager is in
compliance with the holding requirements of Section 6.06(a) immediately prior
to a Permitted Transfer (taking into account any previous Permitted Transfers
by such Company Manager) then the consummation of a Permitted Transfer by such
Company Manager will not be deemed to be a breach of such Company Manager's
covenants and obligations under Section 6.06(a), and such Company Manager will
be deemed to be in compliance with the holding requirements set forth in
Section 6.06(a) following such Permitted Transfer notwithstanding the fact
that the percentage of Parent Common Stock received by such Company Manager
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and then held by such Company Manager
may be less than the applicable share holding percentages set forth in Section
6.06(a).

6.07 Wipfli Audit and Consent. Sellers will use their best efforts to (i)
ensure the completion of Wipfli LLP's audit of the Companies' Year-end
Financial Statements for the years ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 and
(ii) obtain the consent of Wipfli LLP to inclusion of the Companies' Year-end
Financial Statements for the years ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 in
Parent\'s filings with the SEC.

6.08 Employee Benefits. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will adopt a
new 401(k) Plan (the "New Plan") with provisions that are substantially
identical with the provisions of the existing Midwest Transfer Inc. 401(k)
Plan (the "Midwest Transfer Excluded Plan"). The participants in the Midwest
Transfer Excluded Plan will become participants in the New Plan, and their
elections from the Midwest Transfer Excluded Plan will carry over to the New
Plan, without any action required by the participants. Any loans to the
participants under the Midwest Transfer Excluded Plan will not be accelerated
due to the actions contemplated by this Section 6.08 and Sellers will ensure
that such loans may continue to be repaid through salary withholdings, with no
action required by the participants. Prior to the Closing Date, the Midwest
Transfer Excluded Plan will be amended to remove the Company and any of its
subsidiaries as sponsors or participating employers, and to adopt the Midwest
Transfer Excluded Plan by an ERISA Affiliate of the Company, which ERISA
Affiliate will be a newly formed Wisconsin corporation ("Newco"). Newco will
form a brother-sister controlled group with the Company (within the meaning of
Section 1563(a)(2) of the Code). For avoidance of doubt, the equity or assets
of Newco shall not be part of the Transaction. Sellers will terminate the
Midwest Transfer Excluded Plan after the Closing Date. The Sellers agree to
share the results of any compliance audit of the Midwest Transfer Excluded
Plan, any corrective steps taken with respect to the Midwest Transfer Excluded
Plan, and any correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service. Sellers agree
that they will bear all of the costs and expenses associated with the actions
contemplated by this Section 6.08, including, without limitation, any payments
in relation to administrative actions, filing fees, legal expenses, or audit
or other fees. Sellers agree to use their best efforts to complete the post-
Closing actions contemplated by this Section 6.08 within thirty (30) months of
the Closing Date, and if at the time of the Final Release Date such actions
are not completed, the Sellers agree that any amounts held in the Escrow
Account will remain in the Escrow Account until such actions are completed.

6.09 Sellers' Waiver of Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, or any other agreement
or document, each Seller hereby waives any rights he or she may have to
receive indemnification (whether pursuant to statute, articles of
incorporation or articles of organization, bylaws or operating agreement,
contract, or otherwise) from any Entity for his or her service as a director,
officer, or manager of any Entity with respect to the Merger, the Midwest
Transfer Excluded Plan, the New Plan, any former ESOP of any Entity, or the
actions contemplated by Section 6.08, and absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably releases and discharges, fully, finally and forever, the Buyer,
the Parent, the Entities, and their respective past, present and future
Affiliates, equity holders, employees, managers, partners, directors,
officers, agents, attorneys, plan administrators, consultants, advisors,
representatives and Subsidiaries and the respective heirs, successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing from any and all claims, demands, rights,
causes of action, proceedings, orders, remedies, obligations, damages and
liabilities of whatsoever kind or character arising therefrom.

6.10. Limitation on Damages. For the avoidance of doubt, and except where
otherwise specifically permitted by this Agreement, any claims brought by
Buyer, Parent, and any other Buyer Indemnitee under this Agreement, including
without limitation any claims arising out of matters set forth in this Article
6, shall be made in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement, and subject
to the limitations set forth therein, including without limitation Section
5.07(b).

6.11. New York Title Commitment. Sellers agree to use their best efforts to
assist Buyer in obtaining a title commitment from First American Title
Insurance Company (or such other title insurance company as Buyer may choose)
for that certain real property located in Weedsport, New York set forth on
Schedule 3.09(a).

faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

8.06 Construction and Disclosure. Buyer, Sellers, each Entity and the
Sellers\' Representative each acknowledge and agree that they and their
respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the
joint agreement and understanding of the parties hereto, and the language used
in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will
be applied against any Person. The information contained in this Agreement and
in the Disclosure Schedules hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be
an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever
(including any violation of law or breach of contract). Disclosure of an item
on one Disclosure Schedule will be deemed disclosure on another Disclosure
Schedule if (i) a cross reference to such other Disclosure Schedule is made or
(ii) it is readily apparent that the disclosed contract, event, fact,
circumstance or other matter relates to the representations or warranties
covered by such other Disclosure Schedule. Capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given
to them in this Agreement. Time is of the essence in the performance of each
of the parties\' respective obligations contained herein.

8.07 Captions. The captions used in this Agreement and descriptions of the
Disclosure Schedules are for convenience of reference only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement and will not be deemed to limit,
characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and all
provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and construed as if no such
caption or description had been used in this Agreement.

8.08 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended only in a writing
executed and delivered by each of Buyer and Sellers\' Representative. Any
provision of this Agreement may be waived only in a writing signed by the
party against whom such waiver is to be enforced. For the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to a waiver by any one or more Sellers, such waiver may be signed
by the Sellers\' Representative. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any
breach or default hereunder will extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

8.09 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality/Nondisclosure Agreement between Midwest and Buyer dated
January 25, 2019, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements referred to
herein or therein and executed and delivered on or after the date hereof in
connection herewith or therewith, contain the complete agreement among the
parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or between such parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

8.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which will be deemed to be an original, any one of which need not
contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

8.11 Governing Law. All matters relating to the interpretation, construction,
validity and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

8.12 JURISDICTION; VENUE; SERVICE OF PROCESS. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
SECTION 1.02 AND SECTION 6.01 (WHICH WILL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING
THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY SEEKING RELIEF UNDER OR PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT WILL PROPERLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, LIE IN ANY FEDERAL COURT (OR, IF
SUCH FEDERAL COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING, IN A STATE COURT) IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, COUNTY OF JACKSON. BY
EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO
THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT
VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY
SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY
CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS
REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT WILL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS
AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY
STATUTE OR RULE OF COURT.

8.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION WILL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS
AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES
HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

8.14 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the Buyer Indemnities under
Article 5, no Person other than the parties hereto will have any rights,
remedies, or benefits under any provision of this Agreement.

8.15 Payments Under Agreement. Each party agrees that all amounts required to
be paid hereunder will be paid in United States currency and, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount, rebate or
reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset (except any withholding
required by applicable law), on the dates specified herein.

8.16 Sellers\' Representative.

(a) Each Seller constitutes and appoints David P. Millis as his, her or its
representative (the "Sellers\' Representative") and its true and lawful
attorney in fact, with full power and authority in its name and on its behalf:

(i) to act on such Seller\'s behalf in the absolute and reasonable discretion
of Sellers\' Representative with respect to all matters relating to this
Agreement (including, without limitation, actions or inactions in respect of
Section 1.02, Section 6.01, Section 6.08 and Article 5 hereof) and the other
Transaction Documents, and in connection with the activities to be performed
on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents, with such modifications or changes as
the Sellers\' Representative will have consented to; any amendment,
supplement, or modification of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents; and the pursuit, defense, settlement, or waiver of any claim or
right arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents; and

(ii) in general, to do all things and to perform all acts in the absolute and
reasonable discretion of Sellers\' Representative, including, without
limitation, (A) disputing or refraining from disputing any claim made by Buyer
or any Buyer Indemnitee under or with respect to any provisions of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, (B) acting on behalf of Sellers
in any litigation or arbitration or mediation involving this Agreement
(including the indemnification and escrow recovery obligations set forth in
Article 5) or any other Transaction Document and negotiating and compromising
on behalf of each Seller, any dispute that may arise under, and exercising or
refraining from exercising any remedies available under the Transaction
Documents, (C) executing, on behalf of each Seller, any settlement, release,
waiver or other document with respect to such dispute or remedy, (D) executing
and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices
and other instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 8.16, and (E) any and all things deemed necessary
or desirable in the absolute discretion of Sellers\' Representative in
connection with the exercise of any of the foregoing powers and authorities,
including, without limitation, engaging legal counsel, experts, accountants,
consultants or other agents or representatives to advise Sellers'
Representative or act on Sellers' Representative's behalf in fulfilling its
obligations.

(b) This appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an
interest and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this
Agreement and is irrevocable and will not be terminated by any act of any
Seller or by operation of law, whether by the death, incompetency, incapacity,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller or by the occurrence of any other
event, and will be binding on any successor thereto. Each Seller hereby
consents to the taking of any and all actions, the execution of any and all
documents and agreements, and the making of any decisions required or
permitted to be taken or made by Sellers\' Representative pursuant to this
Section 8.16. Each Seller agrees that Sellers\' Representative will have no
obligation or liability to any Person for any action taken or omitted by
Sellers\' Representative in good faith, and each Seller will indemnify and
hold harmless Sellers\' Representative from, and will pay to Sellers\'
Representative the amount of, or reimburse Sellers\' Representative for, any
loss or expense that Sellers\' Representative may suffer, sustain, or become
subject to as a result of any such action or omission by Sellers\'
Representative under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, unless
such loss or expense will have been finally adjudicated to have been caused by
the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Sellers' Representative.

(c) Any decision or action by the Sellers\' Representative hereunder will
constitute a decision or action of all of the Sellers and will be final,
binding and conclusive upon each Seller, and no Seller will have the right to
object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest any such decision or
action. Any notices required to be made or delivered to the Sellers hereunder
or under any other Transaction Document will be made or delivered to the
Sellers\' Representative for the benefit of the applicable Seller and the
making or delivering of such notice to the Sellers\' Representative will
discharge in full the applicable notice requirement.

(d) Buyer will be entitled to rely exclusively and absolutely upon the
communications of Sellers\' Representative relating to the foregoing as the
communications of the Sellers, and upon any document or other paper delivered
by Sellers\' Representative as being authorized by Sellers, from the date
hereof until all obligations and transactions contemplated by and under this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document will have been consummated and/or
discharged. Buyer will be entitled to rely on the authority of Sellers\'
Representative to act on behalf of all Sellers hereunder, and Buyer will not
be liable or accountable in any manner to any Seller for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by Buyer based on such reliance, or for any act or
omission of the Sellers\' Representative in such capacity.

(e) David P. Millis and any Person selected to replace David P. Millis
pursuant to this Agreement, may resign as Sellers\' Representative at any time
by delivering prior written notice to each Company and Buyer. Until all
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will have
been discharged, Sellers who, immediately prior to the Closing, are entitled
in the aggregate to receive more than 50% of the Aggregate Closing
Consideration, may, from time to time upon notice to Buyer and all the
Sellers, appoint a new Sellers\' Representative upon the death, incapacity, or
resignation of Sellers\' Representative. If, after the death, incapacity, or
resignation of Sellers\' Representative, a successor Sellers\' Representative
will not have been appointed by Sellers within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the death, incapacity, or resignation of the prior Sellers\'
Representative, Buyer may appoint a Sellers\' Representative from among the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates to fill any vacancy so created or may
petition a court in the applicable jurisdiction to appoint a Sellers\'
Representative from among the Sellers and their respective Affiliates. Sellers
who, immediately prior to the Closing, are entitled in the aggregate to
receive more than 50% of the Aggregate Closing Consideration, may, from time
to time upon notice to Buyer and all the Sellers, remove and replace any
Sellers' Representative appointed by Buyer and appoint a new Sellers\'
Representative. Upon any appointment of a successor Sellers\' Representative
by Sellers, Sellers will give Buyer prompt written notice (in any event no
later than three (3) Business Days following such appointment) of the
appointment of the successor Sellers\' Representative and the name and contact
information for such successor Sellers\' Representative.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.16, Sellers'
Representative will have no authority to act as the attorney, agent, or
representative, or to execute any documents, on behalf of any Seller to the
extent they relate to any claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification by
such individual Seller under Section 5.03.

(g) The Sellers\' Representative acknowledges that it has carefully read and
understands this Agreement and hereby accepts the appointment and designation
made hereunder.

8.17 Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated
in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto
will re-execute original forms hereof or thereof and deliver them to all other
parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will raise (a)
the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or (b) the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such
defense relates to lack of authenticity.

8.18 Legal Representation. Buyer and the Entities acknowledge and agree that
the documents and papers in the client files of Fox Rothschild LLP and any
other law firm that may have represented the Entities or any firms that may
have represented the Sellers (all such firms, collectively, the "Firms")
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will, upon the Closing, be owned by Sellers, and will be held by the Firms for
the benefit of Sellers. Such documents and papers in the Firms' client files
will not be provided to Buyer or the Entities or their Affiliates or their
successors or assigns following the Closing. The documents and papers in the
Firms' client files subject to this Section 8.18 will include all notes,
memoranda and correspondence between the Firms, Sellers, the Entities and its
officers, directors and other agents regarding this Agreement and the related
transactions, and all attorney work-product in connection with this Agreement
and related transactions, but will exclude any documents not related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, corporate and stock records that customarily are kept in a
minute book, which documents will belong to the Entitles. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees that Fox Rothschild LLP may serve as counsel
to Sellers, on the one hand, and the Entities, on the other hand, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that following the Closing, Fox Rothschild LLP may serve as counsel to any
Seller or any director, manager, member, partner, owner, officer, employee or
Affiliate thereof in connection with any claim, dispute or other matter
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including in connection with any matters contemplated by
Section 1.02 or Section 6.01 hereof), notwithstanding such representation (or
any continued representation) of Seller, the Entities or any of their
Affiliates, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom or in connection therewith.

8.19 Parent Guaranty. Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guaranties the due and punctual performance of all obligations
of Buyer under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including,
without limitation, the payment of the Aggregate Closing Consideration to
Sellers, the issuance of the Parent Common Stock to the Sellers, the payment
of any Underpayment to Sellers, and the payment to Sellers of any and all
damages, claims and losses incurred by the Sellers (except to the extent
limited by the Agreement) arising out of or related to the failure of Buyer to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents. The obligations of Parent under this Section 8.19 will not be
released, discharged or otherwise affected by any assignment of this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document or any rights, interests, benefits or
obligations thereunder by Buyer or Parent, whether by operation of law or
otherwise and whether or not consented to by any of the Sellers. Parent
expressly waives any and all rights, benefits or defenses under (a) any
defense to its obligation to provide the foregoing guaranty, other than the
defense that Buyer has in fact fully and promptly performed all of its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and (b)
any claim or circumstance that would legally or equitably discharge a
guarantor or surety.
