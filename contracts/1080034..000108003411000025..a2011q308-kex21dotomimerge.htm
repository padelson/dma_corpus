NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties set forth herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as
follows: 



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, (b) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and (c) the Company shall continue as the corporation surviving the
Merger and as a wholly‑owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the
corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."



1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section
8.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at the offices
of Parent at 30699 Russell Ranch Road, Suite 250, Westlake Village, California
91361 as promptly as practicable following the satisfaction or valid waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI, unless another place or time is agreed
in writing by Parent and the Company. The date the Closing actually occurs is
referred to as the "Closing Date."

1.3 Actions at the Closing. At the Closing: (a) Parent and Merger Sub shall
deliver to the Company the various certificates, instruments and documents
referenced in Section 6.2, (b) the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger
Sub the various certificates, instruments and documents referenced in Section
6.3 and (c) the parties hereto shall consummate the Merger by filing the
Certificate of Merger in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of acceptance
of such Certificate of Merger by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").



1.4 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.5 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Officers and Directors. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective
Time:

(a)the Company Charter shall, without further action, be amended and restated
as set forth in Exhibit A to the Certificate of Merger, and shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with Applicable Law;

(b)the Bylaws of the Company shall, without further action, be amended and
restated to read the same as the Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the
Effective Time, and shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with Applicable Law; and

(c)the officers and directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation, to serve as such
until the death, resignation, removal or replacement of such persons as
provided by law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.6 Merger Consideration; Effect on Capital Stock. The aggregate maximum
consideration to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub for all the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock and rights to acquire Company Capital Stock at
the Closing shall be $300,000,000 in cash, shares of Parent Common Stock and
the assumption of Company Options, and subject to adjustment as provided in
Sections 1.6(e) and 1.6(f) (such amount, as adjusted pursuant to Sections
1.6(e) and 1.6(f), the "Merger Consideration"), and subject to the deposit of
a portion of the Merger Consideration into the Escrow Fund and the
Equityholder Agent Reimbursement Set-Aside as provided in Section 1.8. With
the exception of the Option Amount that will be reflected in the assumption of
Company Options, amounts payable with respect to Dissenting Shares, and any
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.15, 55% of the Merger Consideration in the
aggregate shall consist of cash (such amount, as adjusted, the "Cash
Consideration") and 45% in the aggregate shall consist of shares of Parent
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"). For the purposes of determining the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Stock Consideration,
each share of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at $17.97 (the "Average
Price"). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub I, the Company or the
Equityholders, the following shall occur:

(a)Conversion of Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time and subject to
Section 1.15:

(i)Company Preferred Stock. Each outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock 

automatically will be converted into the right to receive an amount, without
interest, equal to the Per Share Preference Amount applicable to such class of
Company Preferred Stock plus the Participation Amount per share of Company
Common Stock into which such share of Company Preferred Stock is convertible,
subject to Section 1.8. Such amount will be in the form of consideration set
forth on the Schedule 1.6(a), as updated by the Equityholder Allocation List;

(ii)Company Common Stock. Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock
automatically will be converted into the right to receive an amount, without
interest, equal to the Participation Amount, subject to Section 1.8. Each
share of Company Common Stock held by an employee of the Company as of the
Effective Time shall receive the Participation Amount in the form of Stock
Consideration and each share of Company Common Stock held by a person that is
not an employee of the Company as of the Effective Time shall receive the
Participation Amount in the form of Cash Consideration, subject to Section
1.6(a)(vi) and Section 1.8;

(iii)Company Warrants. Each Company Warrant shall be cancelled and represent,
for each share of Company Capital Stock underlying such Company Warrant (each
such share, a "Warrant Share"), a right to receive an amount, without
interest, equal to the amount such share of Company Capital Stock would be
entitled if it were issued and outstanding, less the applicable per share
exercise price for such Warrant Share (the "Warrant Per Share Amount"),
subject to Section 1.8. In the event that the exercise price per share for any
Company Warrant is greater than the amount to which such share of Company
Capital Stock would be entitled if it were issued and outstanding, then such
Company Warrant shall be terminated by the Company as of the Effective Time
for no consideration;

(iv)Cashed-Out Options. Each (x) option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under the Company\'s sub plan under the Company Plan pursuant to
Section 102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance [New Version] 1961 (the
"Section 102 Options") and (y) vested option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company Plan held by a person who is not an
employee of the Company as of the Effective Time (the "Non-Employee Options")
shall not be assumed by Parent but shall entitle its beneficial holder to be
paid an amount in cash for each share underlying such option, equal to the
Participation Amount minus the exercise price per share for such Cashed-Out
Option. For the Section 102 Options, such consideration shall be transferred
to the trustee appointed by the Company with respect to Section 102 Options,
who shall perform withholding in accordance with the requirements of Section
102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance [New Version] 1961 and distribute the
balance to the beneficial owner of the Section 102 Options;

(v)Allocation of Consideration. The amount payable to each Equityholder on
account of such Equityholder\'s shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Warrants shall be payable in cash, shares of Parent Common Stock, or a
combination of cash and Parent Common Stock, in each case as set forth on the
Equityholder Allocation List provided to Parent as of the date hereof (as
updated pursuant to Section 6.3(l)) (the "Equityholder Allocation List"
opposite the name of such Equityholder (subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 1.6(e), 1.6(f) or 1.15 below). In addition, with respect to each
Equityholder, the Equityholder Allocation List shall set forth the number of
shares of Company Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock, the number of Section 102 Options, the number of Non-Employee Options
and the number of Company Warrants being exchanged for Cash Consideration
(each such share, options or warrant, a "Cash Consideration Shares") and the
number shares of Company Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock and the number of Company Warrants being exchanged for Stock
Consideration (each such share or warrant, "Stock Consideration Shares"),
subject to Section 1.15 below;

(vi)Non-Accredited Investors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Equityholder
(other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) who does not complete and deliver
to the Company or Parent prior to the Closing Date an investor questionnaire
in the form of Exhibit C (unless such Equityholder is an employee of the
Company at Closing or Parent in its sole discretion determines such
Equityholder is an "accredited investor" (as such term is defined in Rule
501(a) under the Securities Act) without having received such a questionnaire)
(a "Non‑Accredited Investor") shall receive the amount of Merger Consideration
payable to such Equityholder pursuant to this Section 1.6(a) solely in the
form of Cash Consideration. In the event that the Equityholder Allocation List
provides that any of such Non-Accredited Investor\'s shares are Stock
Consideration Shares and such Non-Accredited Investor would receive Stock
Consideration, then all of such Non-Accredited Investor\'s shares shall be
treated as Cash Consideration Shares (and none of its shares shall be treated
as Stock Consideration Shares, and such Equityholder shall instead receive an
amount in cash equal to the Average Price for each share of Parent Common
Stock that was allocated to such Equityholder on the Equityholder Allocation
List, and the amount of Cash Consideration Shares and Stock Consideration
Shares indicated as owned by, and the amount of Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration (valued 

at the Average Price) allocated to, each other Equityholder (other than
Equityholders that are receiving only shares of Parent Common Stock) shall be
proportionally adjusted to account for such adjustment for the Non-Accredited
Investor, such that the total Merger Consideration allocated to all
Equityholders on the Equityholder Allocation List does not exceed the
Equityholders Merger Consideration, the total Equityholders Merger
Consideration consists 55% of cash and 45% of shares of Parent Common Stock
(valued at the Average Price), and the aggregate Cash Consideration Shares and
Stock Consideration shares shall be adjusted to provide for such result;
provided, however, that to the extent the Equityholder with respect to whom
the Cash Consideration is increased pursuant to this Section 1.6(a)(v) is a
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (a "Stockholder"),
the adjustment of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration payable to
other Equityholders shall only be made with respect to amounts payable to
Stockholders receiving Stock Consideration. In no event shall Parent issue
shares of Parent Common Stock to more than 35 Non-Accredited Investors, and
the Company and Parent agree that the Equityholder Allocation List shall be
adjusted to provide all Cash Consideration to additional Non-Accredited
Investors (with a corresponding reduction of Cash Consideration and increase
in Stock Consideration (valued at the Average Price) payable to other
Equityholders and a corresponding adjustment to each Equityholder\'s Cash
Consideration shares and Stock Consideration Shares) to the extent that Parent
reasonably believes (after consultation with the Company) that more than 35
Non-Accredited Investors would receive shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger.

For purposes hereof:

(A)"Participation Amount" means (x) the Merger Consideration minus the
Preference Amount divided by (y) the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (calculated on an as-
converted to Company Common Stock basis) issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time, and (2) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of all Company Options, Cashed-Out Options and Company
Warrants issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (calculated in the
case of Company Warrants to purchase Company Preferred Stock, on an as-
converted to Company Common Stock basis).

(B)"Option Exchange Ratio" means the quotient obtained by dividing the
Participation Amount by the Average Price.

(C)"Preference Amount" means the aggregate Liquidation Preference payable on
account of all shares of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to Article IV,
Section 2 of the Company\'s Sixth Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Company Charter").

(D)"Per Share Preference Amount" means $1.833 in the case of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock, $0.7637504 in the case of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock,
$1.767 in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, $2.10 in the case of the
Series C Preferred Stock, $1.00 in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock,
in each case plus any declared and unpaid dividends on such shares of Company
Preferred Stock.

(E)"Equityholders Merger Consideration" means the Merger Consideration minus
the Option Amount.

(F)"Equityholders" means holders of Company Capital Stock, Cashed-Out Options
and Company Warrants.

(G)"Option Amount" means the Participation Amount multiplied by the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all Company
Options issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(b)Company Options. Each Company Option outstanding at the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Parent, and from and after the Effective Time, (i) each
outstanding Company Option shall entitle the holder thereof to acquire the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio and (ii) the exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Options at and after the
Effective Time shall be an amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company Option prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Option Exchange
Ratio. Other than as provided above and except as provided in the relevant
Company Option agreement, each assumed Company Option shall be subject to the
same vesting schedule (including acceleration provisions) and other terms and
conditions for such Company Option as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. It is the intention of the parties that each assumed Company
Option shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option
as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section
422 of the Code and to the extent such Company Option 

qualified as an incentive stock option at the Effective Time. The exercise
price per share and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to each assumed Company Option following the Effective Time as well
as the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in
order to comply with Sections 424(a) and 409A of the Code. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required notices (which notices
shall have been approved by Parent, in its reasonable discretion), if any, to
each holder of Company Options setting forth each holder\'s rights pursuant to
the Company Plan, stating that such Company Options shall be treated in the
manner set forth in this Section 1.6(b). In the event that the exercise price
per share for any Company Option is greater than the Participation Amount,
then such Company Option shall be terminated by the Company as of the
Effective Time for no consideration.

(c) Actions with respect to Company Options. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, (i) the Company
Plan shall terminate and (ii) no holder of a Company Option or any participant
in the Company Plan or any other employee incentive or benefit plan, program
or arrangement or any non-employee director plan maintained by the Company
shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital
stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries,
except the right to receive the payment contemplated by Section 1.6(a)(iv) in
cancellation and settlement thereof or the right to have their Company Options
become options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock contemplated by
Section 1.6(b).

(d)Merger Sub Stock. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding as
of the Effective Time automatically shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, each stock certificate
formerly representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed to
represent an equivalent number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(e)Adjustments for Subsequent Changes.

(i)The amount of Merger Consideration and the Option Exchange Ratio payable
with respect to the Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Cashed-Out Options
or Company Warrants pursuant to Section 1.6 shall be equitably and
appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, reverse split, stock
combination, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock which occurs after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(ii)If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into or
exchanged for a different number of shares or kind of shares and/or other
securities of Parent or another corporation or entity by reason of any stock
split, reverse split, stock combination, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change or any arrangement,
merger, amalgamation or similar statutory procedure (an "Adjustment Event"),
then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered as the Stock
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted so that each Equityholder shall
be entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in lieu of the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock provided for in this Section 1.6, such number and kind
of shares and/or other securities as such holder would have received if it had
held Parent Common Stock on the record date for such Adjustment Event.

(f)Adjustment to Purchase Price. The amount of Merger Consideration paid to
the Equityholders shall be subject to adjustment, on a dollar for dollar
basis, to the extent that Working Capital is more or less than $15,000,000 as
of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Working Capital" is
defined as (i) total current assets (as defined under United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")) of the Company and its subsidiaries
on a combined basis plus the aggregate exercise price of Company Options and
Cashed-Out Options, less (ii) the sum of (A) total current liabilities (as
defined under GAAP) of the Company and its subsidiaries on a combined basis,
(B) all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, (C) all unpaid fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Company, including legal fees, financial advisor fees (including those
described in Section 2.19), employee bonuses and severance benefits payable as
a result of arrangements or actions of the Company existing as of the
Effective Time and fees for a DandO Tail Policy, in each case, incurred in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or resulting from the
Merger, and (D) all unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes (in each case, without
duplication). At least three business days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, the Company shall provide a calculation of the Working Capital of the
Company as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Working Capital
Calculation"), certified by the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer as true and
correct. To the extent that Working Capital as reflected in the Closing Date
Working Capital Calculation is less than $15,000,000, the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.6 shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis
by such shortfall, and the amounts payable to the Equityholders as set forth
on the Equityholder Allocation List shall be appropriately adjusted. Such
adjustment shall be made first by adjustment of the Participation Amount and
then to the Preference Amount. To the extent that Working Capital as reflected
in the Closing Date Working Capital Calculation is more than $15,000,000, the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 shall be increased on a
dollar for dollar basis by such increase, and the amounts payable to the 

Equityholders as set forth on the Equityholder Allocation List shall be
appropriately adjusted by adjustment of the Participation Amount. All
adjustments to the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
pursuant to this Section 1.6(f) shall be made such that the total Merger
Consideration allocated to all Equityholders on the Equityholder Allocation
List does not exceed the Equityholders Merger Consideration, as adjusted, and
the total Equityholders Merger Consideration consists 55% of cash and 45% of
shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Average Price). The Option
Exchange Ratio shall also be adjusted to reflect the adjusted Participation
Amount, but the Option Exchange Ratio shall not be further adjusted after the
Effective Time to account for any errors or misstatements in the Closing Date
Working Capital Calculation.

(g)No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued by virtue of the Merger, and no
dividend, stock split or other distribution with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall relate to any such fractional interest, and any such fractional
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
security holder. In lieu thereof, Parent shall pay to the holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date (and
in the same manner required for delivery of cash and certificates of Parent
Common Stock provided in Section 1.9), an amount in cash equal to such
fraction multiplied by the Average Price.

(h)Company Restricted Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock subject to a
right of repurchase by the Company (other than a right of first refusal) that
is issued and outstanding at the Effective Time ("Company Restricted Shares")
shall be exchanged for a right to receive the Participation Amount payable in
Stock Consideration as set forth on the Equityholder Allocation List, which
amount shall be retained by Parent (and, to the extent provided in Section
1.8, held as part of the Escrow Fund) and not issued to the applicable
Equityholder and be subject to forfeiture by the Stockholder on the same terms
governing such Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such shares of Parent Common Stock, until the restrictions thereon
lapse, is referred to herein as "Restricted Share Consideration"). Restricted
Share Consideration that is held by Parent at a time when the Company
Restricted Share with respect to which such Restricted Share Consideration was
retained would have ceased to continue to vest (e.g., as a result of a
termination of the Stockholder\'s employment, consulting, independent
contracting or other service relationship) shall be permanently retained by
Parent; provided, however, that upon forfeiture by a Stockholder of any
Restricted Share Consideration, Parent will pay to such Stockholder an amount
equal to (i) the repurchase price, if any, in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Company Restricted Shares with respect to which the
Restricted Share Consideration relates, multiplied by (ii) the number of
Company Restricted Shares with respect to which such Restricted Share
Consideration is being retained. Restricted Share Consideration shall be held
by Parent until such consideration is no longer subject to permanent retention
by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Article VII, Parent shall
issue to former holders of Company Restricted Shares any amount of formerly
Restricted Share Consideration with respect to which the restrictions have
lapsed in accordance with the terms applicable to the Company Restricted
Shares prior to the Merger as such Company Restricted Shares would have ceased
to be subject to repurchase thereunder, at times that are consistent with
Parent\'s payroll or employee stock issuance practices, less any Escrow Amount
attributable to such Company Restricted Shares. Any such Escrow Amount shall
be part of the Escrow Fund and shall be distributed to the holder to the
extent provided in Article VII and the Escrow Agreement. The parties agree
that, with the exception of any amounts treated as imputed interest or as
compensation, any distribution of the Escrow Amount to former holders of
Company Restricted Shares shall be treated for income tax purposes as Merger
Consideration paid in respect of such Company Restricted Shares.

(i)Offset. If any Equityholder or holder of Company Options is indebted to the
Company, such indebtedness shall be offset against the Merger Consideration
paid to such Equityholder prior to making any payment to such Equityholder.
Any reduction of Stock Consideration for such offset shall be calculated at
the Average Price.

1.7 Dissenting Shares.

(a)Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares
of Company Capital Stock held by a Stockholder who has properly exercised and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL and who
has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights ("Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall
only be entitled to such rights as are expressly specified in Section 262 of
the DGCL.

(b)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose such holder\'s appraisal
rights (by failing to properly perfect the same or otherwise), then, as of the
occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares of Company Capital Stock
automatically shall be converted into and represent the right to receive only
its share of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6, in each case
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates representing such
shares.

(c)The Company shall give Parent and the Equityholder Agent (i) prompt notice
of any written demand 

for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of
the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. To the
extent that Parent or the Company makes any payment in respect of any
Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be entitled to seek indemnification from the
Escrow Fund (as defined below), pursuant to the claim for Losses provisions of
Article VII hereof, the aggregate amounts by which any such Dissenting Shares
payments exceed the aggregate Merger Consideration that otherwise would have
been payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares.

1.8 Establishment of Escrow; Interest and Dividends. At the Effective Time, on
behalf of the Equityholders, Parent shall deposit into a general escrow
account established pursuant to Article VII (the "Escrow Fund") $28,000,000 of
the Merger Consideration (such amount, as increased and decreased by deposits
(including interest) and withdrawals pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement from time to time, the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Amount shall be
deposited with the Escrow Agent and disbursed as provided in Article VII. The
portion of the Escrow Amount deposited on behalf of each Equityholder shall be
in proportion to the percentage that the Participation Amount otherwise
payable to such Equityholder on account of such Equityholder\'s shares of
Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants, as specified on the Equityholder
Allocation List, bears to the aggregate Participation Amount payable to all
Equityholders (such percentage interests, the "Proportionate Interests") and,
with respect to those Equityholders entitled to receive both Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration, both cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock will be withheld in proportion to the amount of cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock otherwise payable to such Equityholder. For purposes of
determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the
Escrow Fund, each share of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the Average
Price. In addition to the Escrow Amount, $250,000 of the Equityholders Merger
Consideration shall be set aside for use by the Equityholder Agent in
accordance with Section 7.2 (the "Equityholder Agent Reimbursement Set
-Aside")

1.9 Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Merger Consideration.

(a)Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, Parent shall have available, in
immediately available funds and shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance, the amount of the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Amount (less
any amounts otherwise payable with respect to any Dissenting Shares) for
payment to the Equityholders entitled thereto as provided below. In addition,
at the Effective Time, Parent shall separately deposit the Escrow Amount into
the Escrow Fund on behalf of the Equityholders otherwise entitled thereto, as
provided in Section 1.8.

(b)Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Closing, Parent
shall mail to each holder of record of outstanding Company Capital Stock (the
instruments representing the same, "Certificates"), an outstanding Cashed-Out
Option, or an outstanding Company Warrant a letter of transmittal in the form
agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon surrender
of a Certificate to Parent, duly endorsed in blank, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal, or upon submission of a
Company Warrant or a Cashed-Out Option, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal, the surrendering Equityholder shall be
paid by Parent, as promptly as practicable after the date of proper surrender
of a Certificate, Cashed-Out Option or Company Warrant, the amount of Merger
Consideration to which such Equityholder is entitled as determined pursuant to
Section 1.6 (less amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund on behalf of such
Equityholder pursuant to Section 1.8 and subject to Article VII). From and
after the Effective Time, until properly surrendered and cancelled, each
outstanding Certificate, Cashed-Out Option and Company Warrant will be deemed
to evidence only the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger as set forth on Schedule 1.6
(subject to Section 1.8 and Article VII). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall pay Merger Consideration to holders of Section 102 Options
through the trustee for the Section 102 Options as provided in Section
1.6(a)(iv). As provided in the letter of transmittal, by executing and
delivering the same, each Equityholder will (A) acknowledge and agree to
perform the obligations attributed to such person hereunder, (B) acknowledge
and agree to the indemnification and other obligations set forth in Article
VII, and (C) approve and confirm the appointment of the Equityholder Agent.
Parent may appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company
pursuant to a paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company to perform the procedures set forth in this Section
1.9.

(c)Transfers of Ownership. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid or
allocated to a person other than the holder in whose name the Certificate
surrendered is registered, it will be a condition of the payment or allocation
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered must be properly endorsed and
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence compliance with any applicable securities laws and
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

(d)No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article I,
none of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub I or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any Equityholder for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

1.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. Following the
Effective Time, there shall be no 

further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of any shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Cashed-Out Options or
Company Warrants which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If Certificates, Company Options, Cashed-Out Options or Company Warrants
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason after the Effective
Time, such Certificates or other instruments immediately shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I (subject to Section 1.8 and Article
VII).

1.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificates or Company
Warrants have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay such amount
(less any amounts deposited into the Escrow Fund on behalf of the holder) as
otherwise would be required pursuant to this Article I in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates or Company Warrants promptly following
receipt of an affidavit in a form satisfactory to Parent of that fact;
provided, however, that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to such payment or issuance require the purported owner of
any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates or Company Warrants to deliver
a bond (in the event that the value of the Merger Consideration payable with
respect to such lost Certificate is $250,000 or more) or indemnity agreement
(at such owner\'s sole cost and expense) in such sum as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates or Company Warrants
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

1.12 Necessary Actions; Further Action. If any further action is necessary or
desirable at any time after the Effective Time to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub
in the Surviving Corporation or to vest Parent with a 100% ownership interest
in the Surviving Corporation, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to take, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
such persons to take, all such lawful, necessary or desirable action so long
as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

1.13 Required Deductions and Withholding; Payment of Taxes. The Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to
any Equityholder such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or pursuant to any
other applicable legal requirement. Such amounts shall be first deducted from
any Cash Consideration payable to the applicable Equityholder and second from
any Stock Consideration payable to such Equityholder. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid absent such deduction or withholding.

1.14 Fluctuations in Market Price of Parent Common Stock. Parent, the Company
and the Stockholders acknowledge that the market price of the Parent Common
Stock may fluctuate significantly. The potential risk of increases or
decreases in the price of Parent Common Stock has been taken into account in
connection with the negotiation of the amount of cash and Parent Common Stock
to which Stockholders will be entitled in the Merger and the conditions on
which they will become so entitled.

1.15 Tax Consequences of the Merger.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (except the
remaining provisions of this Section 1.15), if the product of (i) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger in exchange for
Company Capital Stock (excluding the Restricted Share Consideration) and (ii)
the Testing Price (as defined below) (such product, the "Value of Stock
Consideration") is less than 40% of the sum of the Value of Stock
Consideration and the amount of Non-Stock Consideration (as defined below),
then the number and type of Cash Consideration Shares shall be reduced, and
the number and type of Stock Consideration Shares shall be increased, so as to
cause such percentage to be equal to (as close as possible, but not below)
40%. Such adjustment shall decrease the number and type of Cash Consideration
Shares and increase the number and type of Stock Consideration Shares in the
manner determined jointly by Parent and the Equityholder Agent; provided, that
(A) such adjustment shall be made in a manner that preserves the value to be
received by each Stockholder (valuing each share of Parent Common Stock at the
Average Price), and (B) the increase in aggregate Stock Consideration is
allocated to each Stockholder in proportion to its share of the aggregate
Stock Consideration such Stockholder would have received but for this Section
1.15 (unless Parent and Equityholder Agent agree otherwise). For the sake of
clarity, no Stockholder who otherwise would receive solely Cash Consideration
shall receive Stock Consideration by reason of this Section 1.15. If an
adjustment occurs pursuant to this Section 1.15, then the percentage of Stock
Consideration and Cash Consideration deposited into the Escrow Fund pursuant
to Section 1.8 shall be adjusted to equal the same percentages as the
percentages of Merger Consideration comprising Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration as so adjusted, valuing the Stock Consideration using the
Average Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the total
number of shares of Parent 

Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger and upon exercise of options
assumed by Parent in the Merger exceed 19.9% of the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Stock
Consideration Cap").

(b) For purposes of this Section 1.15:

(i)"Non-Stock Consideration" shall mean the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration
(including cash transferred to the Escrow Account), (B) any cash paid pursuant
to the Lock-up Agreements, (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(g), (D) the maximum amount of cash paid and
expected to be paid by Parent and the Company on account of Dissenting Shares,
(E) any cash or the fair market value of any property that is distributed,
transferred, or paid (or deemed for federal income tax purposes to have been
distributed, transferred or paid) by the Company to its stockholders and that
satisfies the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e)(1)(ii), and (F) any other cash or property (other than shares of
Parent Common Stock) that is transferred, paid or distributed by Parent (or
any person related to Parent within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368 1(e)(3)) to Stockholders in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger;

(ii)"Testing Price" shall be the lowest of the following amounts, as reported
on the NASDAQ: (A) the closing Parent Common Stock trading price on the
Valuation Date, (B) the average between the high and low Parent Common Stock
trading prices on the Valuation Date, and (C) the volume weighted average of
the trading prices of all shares of Parent Common Stock traded on the
Valuation Date.

(iii)"Valuation Date" shall mean the applicable valuation date as counsel for
the Company and the Parent mutually agree is appropriate under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(2) for purposes of testing the continuity of
interest requirement under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) with respect
to the Mergers. The parties expect this date to be the trading day immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement.

hereby and thereby, subject only to the requisite approval of the Merger and
this Agreement by the Stockholders. The execution and delivery of this

determined that this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Merger and the allocation of

will be) duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company party thereto,
and each constitutes (or will constitute upon execution and delivery) a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its respective terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by principles of public policy and subject to the laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and
rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other

Company\'s knowledge, there is no 

agreement, arrangement or understanding that restricts or relates to voting,
giving of written consents, dividend rights or restrictions on transfer of any
Company or subsidiary voting securities, including any voting trust or any
valid and outstanding or irrevocable proxy agreement or arrangement.

(c)The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
by the Company does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other

governing documents of the Company; or

(ii)conflict with, or result in any material violation of, or default under or

order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company, its subsidiaries or any of their material properties or assets.

Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Company and each subsidiary has withheld and paid to the applicable financial
institution or Tax authority all amounts required by Applicable Law to be

times been the Company) or has any liability for the Taxes of any other person
(other than an entity that is a member of the consolidated group of
corporations that has at all times had the Company as its common parent) under
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or

Post-Closing Tax Period or accelerate a deduction into the Pre-Closing Tax

occurred that would have the effect of limiting the use of "pre-change

Effective Time will be held by a person whose exercise of such Company Option
would be governed by Section 421(a) of the 

Code (determined without regard to Section 422(a)(1) of the Code). As of the
time of its grant, the exercise price of each Company Option was not less than
the fair market value of the Company Capital Stock, and there has been no
modification made to the terms of any Company Option since the date of its
issuance. All Company Common Stock issued in connection with the performance
of services (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code) is either (A)
transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the

defined in Section 1361 of the Code.

(c)For purposes of this Section 2.8, references to the Company or any
subsidiary shall include references to any predecessors of the Company or any
subsidiary to the extent an inaccuracy or breach of a representation as
applied to such predecessor could result in a liability of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries.

2.9 Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no Contract or any judgment,
injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity (an "Order") to which
the Company or any subsidiary is a party or otherwise binding upon the Company
or any subsidiary which has or reasonably could be expected to have the effect
of prohibiting or impairing in any material respect any business practice or

extent, and which do not materially detract from the value, or materially
interfere with the present use, of the property subject thereto or affected
thereby. All such leased assets and properties are free and clear of any Liens

such information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs
as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be
required or appropriate for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any
amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to
cooperate with the other\'s counsel and auditors in the preparation of the
Information Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company agrees to, and the Company shall cause its subsidiaries to include in
the Information Statement a summary of the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements (including
the Merger and the allocation of the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration among the Equityholders). The Company will promptly advise
Parent and Parent will promptly advise the Company in writing if at any time
prior to the Effective Time either the Company or Parent shall obtain
knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or
supplement the Information Statement in order to make the statements contained

material fact or comply with Applicable Law. The Information Statement shall
(A) contain the unanimous recommendation of the Company Board that the
Stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and

supplement to the Information Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in
preparing and mailing to Stockholders such amendment or supplement.

(b)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall distribute to the Stockholders
(i) written consents of the Stockholders to approve or disapprove, under
Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code, any compensation, benefit or amounts
that may be deemed to result in an "excess parachute payment" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) to each person who is a "disqualified
individual" with respect to the Company, within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code, such that such compensation, benefit or amounts will not be
payable or otherwise inure to the benefit of such person in a manner that will
result in such amount being treated as such an "excess parachute payment"
(such approval, the "280G Approval"); and (ii) adequate disclosure to the
Stockholders entitled to vote on such matter of all material facts concerning
all payments (or other benefits) that, but for such vote, could be deemed
"parachute payments" to a "disqualified individual" under Code Section 280G in
a manner that satisfies Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(c)The Parent and its counsel shall have the right and a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all documents to be delivered to the
Stockholders in connection with the written consents.

Confidential Information regarding the Company. The Company may include
reference to the existence of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (but without disclosure of the amount of the Merger Consideration or
any other financial terms hereof) in any request for any third-party consent

obtain in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements in order to avoid any conflict with,

properties and stock either prior to or following the Merger.

5.6 Notification of Certain Matters.The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of the occurrence or non‑occurrence of any event, the occurrence or
non‑occurrence of which is reasonably likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company or the Stockholders contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time or any failure of the
Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by the Company hereunder. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company of the occurrence or non‑occurrence of any event, the

or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time or any failure of the Parent
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not act as a waiver of or

Parent three days before the anticipated Closing Date an updated disclosure
schedule containing disclosures only about the operations of the Company and
its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

or suppliers or termination of customers or suppliers (the "Updated Disclosure
Schedule"). Only to the extent that such disclosures relate to operations of
the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the
information in such Updated Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to modify the
representations and warranties of the Company to which they relate for
purposes of Section 6.3(a) and Article VII hereof, but no other disclosure in
such Updated Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to constitute an exception to
any of the Company\'s representations and warranties under Article II, nor

Persons") pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in the Company
Charter and Bylaws, as in effect on the date hereof; provided that in no event

Time, the Company shall purchase a tail with respect to the termination of its
present directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy, which tail
policy shall have coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage

persons than the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof and shall cover persons who
are covered by such insurance as of the Effective Time for a period of at
least 6 years after the Closing (the "DandO Tail Policy"). Parent agrees to
maintain, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, the DandO Tail
Policy until it expires in accordance with its terms, provided that Parent
shall not have any obligation to pay any additional amounts for such DandO Tail
Policy. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will amend the
indemnification provisions set forth in the Company Charter or Bylaws in a
manner that adversely affects the Indemnified DandO Persons. The obligations of
the Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.15 shall
continue in full force and effect for a period commencing as of the Closing
and ending on the six year anniversary of the Closing; provided, that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any 

claim for indemnification under this Section 5.15 asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim and, provided,
further, that if the DandO Tail Policy is obtained for a period of longer than
six (6) years and such policy requires that the underlying indemnification
obligations of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation continue for the term
of the policy, then the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 5.15 shall continue for the length of the DandO Tail Policy,
up to a maximum period of ten (10) years from the Effective Time. The
provisions of this Section 5.15 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified D and O Persons and the estate, heirs
and representatives of each of them, and except as specified herein, nothing
herein shall affect any indemnification rights that the Indemnified D and O
Persons (or any of them) or their respective estate, heirs and representatives
may have under the Company Charter or Bylaws , any Applicable Law, any
Contract or otherwise.

5.16 Company Employees. As of the Effective Time, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and/or their respective subsidiaries shall provide each
employee of the Company that remains an employee of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees"), with
(a) base cash compensation and bonus opportunity for the remainder of 2011
comparable to the base cash compensation and bonus opportunity of such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) comparable
types of employee benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension plan and
incentive and/or equity-based compensation arrangements) ("Parent Plans"), as
those provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent. For purposes of
determining eligibility to participate and vesting where length of service is
relevant under any Parent Plan (other than a defined benefit pension plan) and
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of the Parent Plans
and subject to any applicable break in service or similar rule, Parent shall
provide the Continuing Employees with service credit under the Parent Plans
for their period of service with the Company prior to the Effective Time,
except where doing so would cause a duplication of benefits. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition
(or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Plan that is a group
health plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents in accordance with Applicable Laws and, if the Effective
Time occurs on a date other than the last day of a Company Employee Plan year
and such benefits are provided under Parent Plans, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide them with credit for any co-
payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during the
Company Employee Plan year including the Effective Time for the purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements
under any Parent Plan in which they are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time. Nothing contained in this Section 5.16 shall create any rights
of any nature or kind whatsoever in any officer or employee or former officer
or employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or
any subsidiary in respect of continued employment for any specified period.
This Section 5.16 shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, executors
and legal representatives. Nothing in this Section 5.16 express or implied:
(x) is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; (y) shall require the
Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries to maintain any specific employee
benefit plan or (z) shall constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan
or program.

5.17 Books and Records. From and after the Closing, the Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain a reasonable records retention policy. After
the Closing, the Stockholder Agent and its accountants, lawyers and
representatives shall be entitled at all reasonable times to have access to
and to make copies of the books and records and other information of the
Surviving Corporation for any purpose relating to the Equityholders\'
ownership of the Company prior to the Closing, including, without limitation,
the preparation of Tax Returns. In the event of any litigation or threatened
litigation between the parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, the covenants contained in this Section 5.17 shall not be
considered a waiver by any party of any right to assert the attorney-client
privilege.

5.18 Continuing Counsel. Parent hereby acknowledges that Choate has acted as
counsel to the Company prior to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as well as in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and that the form of the
transaction as a merger may result in Parent inheriting the attorney/client
relationship and the rights pertaining thereto that currently exists between
the Company and Choate. Parent agrees that (a) it will not seek to disqualify
Choate from acting and continuing to act as counsel to the Equityholder Agent
in the event of a dispute hereunder or in the course of the defense or
prosecution of any claim relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (b) the Equityholders have a
reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to their communications with
Choate prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such communications
relate, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

5.19 Warn Act. Parent shall be solely responsible for issuing, serving and
delivering all orders and notices required, if any, pursuant to the WARN Act,
as amended, or its state or municipal law equivalent, and for any liability
resulting from the failure to timely issue such orders or notices in
connection with the termination of any employees of any of the Company on or
after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE VII

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW

7.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. Subject to the limitations
provided for herein, all representations and warranties in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any other claims
that may be made pursuant to this Article VII shall survive the Merger and
continue until the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
except that claims with respect to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 and claims for fraud or
willful misconduct ("Special Losses") shall survive until the last day of the
longest of any applicable statute of limitations period for any Third Party
Claim relating to the particular representation, warranty, covenant or other
matter, as the case may be.

7.2 Indemnity and Escrow Arrangements. 

(a)Indemnification. Subject to the limitations provided for herein, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent and its affiliates shall be indemnified and
held harmless from the Escrow Fund, and, as provided in Section 7.2(c)(ii), by
each Equityholder, from and against any and all claims, diminution in value
losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, judgments, expenses, fines, awards,
penalties, sanctions or other damages, and including any settlement costs,
reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs of investigation and preparation,
expressly excluding consequential or punitive damages (other than with respect
to diminution in value Losses or to the extent actually paid or payable by
Parent or its affiliates to a Third Party (any and all such amounts,
collectively, "Losses") which Parent or any of its affiliates suffers or
incurs by reason, directly or indirectly, of:

(i)any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach by the Company of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained herein or in any Ancillary
Agreement;

(ii)any breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement of the Company
contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement;

(iii)any inaccuracy in the calculation, or the actual amount, of the Working
Capital as of the Closing Date or any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in the
Updated Capitalization Schedule or in the updated Equityholder Allocation
List;

(iv)any amounts per share required to be paid in satisfaction of appraisal
rights to the extent greater than the amounts to which any dissenting
Stockholders would be entitled pursuant to the Merger (and including any
Losses associated with any proceedings or settlement entered into to determine
or settle the amount payable to dissenting Stockholders);

(v)any Taxes that are Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent such Taxes exceed the
amount of such Taxes that reduced Working Capital in the Closing Date Working
Capital Calculation, as finally determined; provided, however, that the tax
liability referred to in the first bullet in item (iv) of Section 2.8(b) of
the Company Schedule shall not be treated as a Pre-Closing Tax for this
purpose; and

(vi)any Losses of Parent or the Surviving Corporation based on claims of the
Equityholders relating to any actions taken by the Equityholder Agent
hereunder or pursuant hereto.

For purposes of indemnification obligations hereunder and the calculation of
Losses pursuant to Article VII, any inaccuracy in or breach of a
representation of warranty shall be deemed to constitute a breach of such
representation or warranty, notwithstanding any limitation or qualification as
to materiality set forth in such representation or warranty as to the scope,
accuracy or completeness thereof, it being the intention of the parties that,
subject only to the provisions of Section 7.2(c), Parent and its affiliates
shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all Losses
arising out of or based upon or with respect to the failure of any such
representation or warranty to be true, correct and complete in any respect. No
investigation conducted by or on behalf of any party at any time and no
disclosure provided to or knowledge of any party with respect to any event,
condition or circumstance that renders inaccurate any representation or
warranty (except, the disclosure set forth in the Company Schedule) or reveals
the occurrence of a breach of any covenant of any other party contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of,
or to relieve such other party of any liability for: (i) the breach of any
such representation, warranty or covenant, or (ii) any rights to
indemnification or other remedy arising in connection therewith. Parent
expressly reserves the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VII
for any Losses arising out of or relating to any such breach notwithstanding
any investigation, disclosure or knowledge as described herein.

(b)Escrow Fund. At the Effective Time, without any act of any Equityholder,
Parent will deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account with an
institution (the "Escrow Agent") selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company or Equityholder Agent, such deposit to establish and constitute
the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be governed by the terms set forth in
this Section 7.2 and the Escrow Agreement entered into between Parent, the
Equityholder Agent and the Escrow Agent in the form agreed by Parent, the
Company and the Equityholder Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"), with such changes
as the Escrow Agent may reasonably propose and Parent and the Equityholder
Agent may agree to. To the extent that the provisions of the Escrow Agreement
agreed by Parent and the Equityholder Agent differ from this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement shall govern. Parent shall pay one-half of the costs and
expenses related to the establishment and maintenance of the Escrow Fund and
the Equityholders shall pay one-half of such costs and expenses. The cash
portion of the Escrow Amount shall be deposited into an interest bearing
account and any interest earned thereon shall be added to the Escrow Fund and
available to cover Losses of Parent and its affiliates hereunder. Any
distributions on the shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund
other than cash dividends shall be held by the Escrow Agent and shall be
deemed attached to the shares of Parent Common Stock to which they pertain.
Any cash dividends paid with respect to any Equityholder\'s Parent Common
Stock held in the Escrow Fund shall be paid to such Equityholder. For
applicable income tax 

purposes, any shares of Parent Common Stock and amounts distributed in respect
thereof shall be treated as owned by the Equityholder on whose behalf such
securities are being held. For applicable income tax purposes, any cash earned
on the Escrow Amount and held in the Escrow Fund (other than amounts
distributed with respect to Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund, which
amounts shall be treated as owned by the Equityholders) shall be treated as
owned by Parent unless and until the Escrow Fund is released to the
Equityholders, and Parent shall be entitled to receive distributions from such
cash sufficient to satisfy its tax liabilities with respect thereto. The
Equityholders shall not have the right to sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate
or otherwise dispose of any cash or securities held in the Escrow Fund or any
interest therein for so long as they are held in the Escrow Fund, other than
in connection with a sale by the Escrow Agent to satisfy claims as provided
herein. Each Equityholder shall be entitled to vote the shares of Parent
Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund on behalf of such Equityholder. Any
amounts distributed to Parent from the Escrow Fund in payment of claims
pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken pro rata from each Equityholder
based on its Proportionate Interest, first from the cash included in the
Escrow Fund on account of such Equityholder (to the extent thereof). To the
extent the cash held in the Escrow Account on behalf of an Equityholder is not
sufficient to satisfy such Equityholder\'s share of a claim, the Escrow Agent
shall, on behalf of such Equityholder, sell an appropriate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to achieve proceeds equal to the amount to be distributed
to Parent from the Escrow Fund in respect of such Equityholder and deliver the
proceeds to Parent.

(c)Recourse to the Escrow Fund; Limitations.

(i)Except in the case of (A) indemnification under Sections 7.2(a)(iii), (iv)
or (v) or (B) Special Losses, Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification
under Section 7.2(a) unless and until the aggregate of all Losses suffered by
Parent and its affiliates hereunder exceeds $2,500,000 (the "Threshold"),
whereupon the Parent and its affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification
for the amount of all Losses incurred by Parent and its affiliates, including
the amount of the Threshold; provided, that, except in the case of (A)
indemnification under Sections 7.2(a)(iii), (iv) or (v) or (B) Special Losses,
no item of Losses may be claimed by Parent or any of its affiliates or shall
be included in calculating the aggregate Losses for purposes of this clause
(ii) except when such item of Losses is in excess of $50,000 (the "Minimum
Loss Amount"). An "item" of Loss shall refer to all Losses arising out of or
relating to a single fact, circumstance, omission or event or a series of
related facts, circumstances, omissions and/or events. Except in the case of
(A) indemnification under Sections 7.2(a)(iii), (iv) or (v) or (B) Special
Losses, under this Article VII, Parent shall not be entitled to recover more
than an amount equal to (x) $28,0000,000 in cash and sale proceeds of shares
of Parent Common Stock plus (y) the amount of interest earned on the Escrow
Fund.

(ii)In the event that Parent or its affiliates incur Special Losses
recoverable pursuant to this Article VII that are in excess of the Escrow
Amount or incurred after the Escrow Fund has been released, the Equityholders
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates from and against
all such Special Losses, severally and not jointly; provided that each
Equityholder shall be responsible only for its pro rata portion (determined
based on the proportion that the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration
payable to such Equityholder bears to the aggregate total Merger Consideration
(the Equityholder\'s "Pro Rata Portion") of the aggregate amount of such
Losses recoverable by Parent; and provided, further, the Equityholder\'s Pro
Rata Portion of such Losses in all events shall be limited to the Merger
Consideration received by such Equityholder (the "Cap").

(iii)For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Effective Time, (x) the
provisions of this Section 7.2 shall be the sole and exclusive right and
remedy of the Parent and its affiliates for any breach, inaccuracy or non-
fulfillment of any representation, warranty, covenant or other provision
contained in this Agreement, or for any other claims or Losses arising under
or related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and (y)
each Equityholder\'s aggregate maximum indemnification obligation under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall equal such Equityholder\'s Pro
Rata Portion of the amount of the Cap. From and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor its affiliates shall bring any claim with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, other than (A) an
indemnification in accordance with this Section 7.2, and (B) a claim for
Special Losses in accordance with this Section 7.2. The provisions of this
Article VII constitute an integral part of the consideration given to the
Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement and were specifically bargained for
and reflected in the total amount of the Merger Consideration payable to the
Equityholders in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d)Termination and Distribution of Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall
terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time;
provided, however, that such portion of the Escrow Fund, which in the
reasonable judgment of Parent is necessary to cover any unsatisfied or
disputed Losses specified in any Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the
Escrow Agent and the Equityholder Agent at or prior to termination of the
Escrow Fund shall remain in the Escrow Fund (and the Escrow Fund shall remain
in existence) until all such claims have been satisfied or resolved. As soon
after the scheduled expiration of the Escrow Fund as all claims for Losses
have been satisfied or resolved, the Escrow Agent shall 

deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund to the Equityholders on whose
behalf such Escrow Funds were deposited in accordance with their respective
Proportionate Interests therein, and the proportion of cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock deposited on behalf of such Equityholders.

(e)Claims. In order to make a claim for Losses pursuant to this Article VII,
Parent shall deliver to Escrow Agent (solely with respect to Losses up to the
Escrow Amount and subject to the last sentence of Section 7.2(c)(i)), and the
Equityholder Agent a certificate signed by any authorized officer of Parent
(an "Officer\'s Certificate"): (i) stating that Parent or its affiliates has
paid, suffered or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will pay,
suffer or accrue Losses; (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual
items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was
paid, suffered or accrued, or the basis for such anticipated Losses; (iii) the
nature of the Losses to which such item is related; and (iv) the amount of
Losses Parent seeks from the Escrow Fund or otherwise; provided, however, that
the amount specified by Parent as provided in clause (iv) shall not be
irrevocable, and Parent may seek recovery in different amounts by a written
supplemental notice to the Escrow Agent, as applicable, and Equityholder
Agent. Parent shall not be estopped by any estimate it may make of the amount
of any anticipated or actual Losses claimed in any Officer\'s Certificate, or
the bases therefor, and Parent may submit amendments to any Officer\'s
Certificate, or additional Officer\'s Certificates, in the event that actual
or anticipated Losses, or the bases therefor, subsequently change or are
determined to be different than represented in an Officer\'s Certificate
previously delivered. Immediately upon receipt of such Officer\'s Certificate,
the Escrow Agent shall set aside an amount in the Escrow Fund equal to the
aggregate amount of Losses claimed from the Escrow Fund in the Officer\'s
Certificate. The Escrow Agent shall not distribute any amounts to Parent out
of the Escrow Fund for forty-five (45) days after the date of the Officer\'s
Certificate, unless the Equityholder Agent authorizes the Escrow Agent to make
such distribution prior to such date. To the extent that Parent has delivered
an Officer\'s Certificate for an indemnification claim based on a Loss it
anticipates paying, suffering or accruing but has not yet incurred, then the
Escrow Agent shall not pay such claim to Parent until Parent notifies the
Escrow Agent that Parent has actually paid or incurred such Loss, in which
case the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay such amount to Parent, unless such
Officer\'s Certificate is subject to an unresolved objection from the
Equityholder Agent (but such notice of incurrence shall not start any new or
restart any previous period for objection by the Equityholder Agent).

(f)Objections to Claims. The Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent from the
Escrow Fund, or, once the Escrow Fund has been exhausted or released, for
Special Losses only, the Equityholders shall pay, the full amount of actual
Losses claimed in the Officer\'s Certificate immediately after the forty-five
(45) day waiting period specified in subparagraph (e) expires (or at such
earlier date as the Equityholder Agent may authorize), unless prior to such
time the Equityholder Agent delivers a written objection to the claim made in
the Officer\'s Certificate (a "Notice of Dispute") to the Escrow Agent, if
applicable, with a copy to Parent and its counsel. The Notice of Dispute must
include a reasonably detailed description of the basis of the objection, as
well as the amount of Losses, if any, which the Equityholder Agent is not
disputing. Any undisputed Losses immediately shall be paid by the Escrow Agent
or the Equityholders, as applicable. If the Equityholder Agent does not timely
deliver a Notice of Dispute, the Equityholder Agent shall be deemed to have
irrevocably approved and consented to the payment of all Losses specified in
the Officer\'s Certificate. The Escrow Agent and Parent shall be entitled to
rely on and act in accordance with any written or deemed approval and consent
of the Equityholder Agent in immediately distributing the amount of any actual
Losses claimed in a specific Officer\'s Certificate (and in subsequently
distributing amounts from the Escrow Fund to cover any anticipated Losses upon
occurrence or incurrence), even if the Equityholder Agent subsequently objects
to or disputes the nature or amount of Losses. At such time as the amounts in
the Escrow Fund are depleted to cover Losses, all Equityholders automatically
shall cease to have any claim on any portion of the Escrow Fund.

(g)Resolution of Conflicts.

(i)If the Equityholder Agent timely and properly delivers a Notice of Dispute,
the Equityholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith, for a period of
ninety (90) days after the delivery of a Notice of Dispute, to agree upon the
rights and responsibilities of the respective parties with respect to such
Losses; provided that if the amount of such Losses relates to third party
claims that are the subject of an ongoing proceeding before a court,
arbitrator or Governmental Entity and remain to be definitively determined or
are anticipated but not yet incurred, then the 90-day period specified above
shall commence after the amount of Losses have been definitively determined
unless otherwise agreed by the parties. If the Equityholder Agent and Parent
should agree as a result of their good faith efforts as to the appropriate
amount and treatment of such Losses, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties (a "Joint Written Instruction")
and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent (to the extent the Losses are to be
paid from the Escrow Fund). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on and
act in accordance with any such Joint Written Instruction and promptly shall
distribute to Parent the specified amounts from the Escrow Fund.

(ii)If no agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent
or the Equityholder Agent may initiate a proceeding in any court of competent
jurisdiction to seek enforcement of its rights 

or resolution of the dispute under this Section 7.2. The Escrow Agent and
Parent shall be entitled to act in accordance with any resulting court
decision and make payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with any final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(h)Appointment of Equityholder Agent; Power of Attorney.

(i)If the Merger is approved, immediately upon the Effective Time and without
further act of any Equityholder, David Vogel shall be appointed as the agent
and attorney‑in‑fact (such person, and any successor or replacement thereof as
provided below, the "Equityholder Agent") for each Equityholder. The
Equityholder Agent shall be authorized, for and on behalf of all
Equityholders, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
the distribution to Parent of monies from the Escrow Fund, to object to such
distributions, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, litigate or arbitrate, comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to any claims for Losses and to take all other
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Equityholder Agent to
accomplish the foregoing. Each Equityholder agrees that the Equityholder Agent
may consult with counsel chosen by the Equityholder Agent and shall have full
and complete authorization in good faith to act or refrain from acting in
accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The Equityholder Agent may be
replaced by the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the Proportionate
Interests (the "Equityholder Majority") from time to time upon not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent certifying that the
Equityholder Agent has been removed by the requisite vote or consent of such
holders, specifying the percentage of all Proportionate Interests so voted or
consenting and specifying the substitute Equityholder Agent appointed by such
holders. The Equityholder Agent may resign upon not less than thirty (30)
days\' notice to the Equityholder Majority and Parent, whereupon the
Equityholder Majority shall, prior to the expiration of such 30-day period,
appoint a replacement Equityholder Agent. No bond shall be required of the
Equityholder Agent, and the Equityholder Agent shall not receive any
compensation for his, her or its services. Notices or communications to or
from the Equityholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Equityholders.

(ii)Neither the Equityholder Agent nor any agent employed by it shall incur
any liability to Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub I, Surviving Corporation or
any Equityholder or holder of Company Options or Cashed-Out Options relating
to the performance of the Equityholder Agent\'s duties or exercise of the
Equityholder Agent\'s rights hereunder, except for actual fraud or bad faith
acts by the Equityholder Agent or pursuant to the commission by the
Equityholder Agent on a continuing basis of acts or omissions finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been willful or
grossly negligent. By virtue of having approved and adopted this Agreement or
by delivering a Letter of Transmittal, each of the Equityholders hereby
severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Equityholder Agent and any agent employed by it against any loss, liability or
expense incurred (i) without fraud or bad faith on the part of the
Equityholder Agent and (ii) other than pursuant to the commission by the
Equityholder Agent of acts or omissions finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have been willful or grossly negligent arising out
of or in connection with its performance or exercise of obligations and rights
under this Agreement. The Equityholder Agent shall be entitled to receive
reimbursement from the Equityholder Agent Reimbursement Set-Aside for any and
all expenses, charges and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys\' fees,
incurred by the Equityholder Agent in the performance or discharge duties and
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. To the extent
the Equityholder Agent is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section, each Equityholder shall bear its Proportionate Interest of amounts
payable to satisfy such claim. The Equityholder Agent shall be entitled to
advancement and reimbursement of expenses upon release of amounts from the
Escrow Fund, as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

(iii)The Equityholder Agent Reimbursement Set-Aside shall be held by the
Escrow Agent in a separate account for reimbursements payable to the
Equityholder Agent under this Section 7.2. Any portion of the Equityholder
Agent Reimbursement Set-Aside deposited with the Escrow Agent at the Closing
that has not been utilized by the Equityholder Agent pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement at or prior to such time as the amounts in the Escrow Fund are
depleted to cover Losses, shall be distributed to the Equityholders pursuant
to the instructions of the Equityholder Agent.

(i)Actions of the Equityholder Agent. Any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Equityholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Equityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the
Equityholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Equityholder Agent as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every Equityholder. The Escrow Agent, the
Company (and the Surviving Corporation after the Merger) and Parent hereby are
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholder
Agent or for any actions taken by the Equityholder Agent. 

(j)Adjustment to Merger Consideration. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that any payment under this Section 7.2 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for federal, state, local and foreign
income Tax purposes and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns
accordingly, unless a final determination (within the meaning of Code Section
1313) causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment.

(k)Subrogation. If Parent or any of its affiliates receives an indemnification
payment hereunder, and has a claim against (i) an insurer under a policy
maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) any
other Contract of the Company or its subsidiaries in existence immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in respect of the related Losses, then the
Equityholder Agent shall be subrogated to the rights and claims of Parent and
its affiliates against such third party. The Equityholder Agent shall not,
however, have the right to collect aggregate payments form such third
part(ies) in excess of the actual amount of the indemnification payment
previously paid with respect to such Losses. Parent and its affiliates will
execute and deliver such documents and take such other actions as the
Equityholder Agent may reasonably require in order to give effect to this
Section 7.2(k). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent reasonably determines
that such subrogation would materially adversely affect its relationship with
a material customer or supplier of the Company, it may elect not to permit
subrogation in such case.

7.3 Third Party Claims. If Parent becomes aware of any third‑party claim which
Parent believes may result in a claim for Losses, against the Escrow Fund or
otherwise (a "Third Party Claim"), Parent shall promptly notify the
Equityholder Agent of such claim; provided, however, that failure to give such
notice shall not relieve the Equityholders of their obligations hereunder,
except to the extent they shall have been materially prejudiced by such
failure.

(a)In case any Third Party Claim is asserted against Parent or any of its
affiliates, the Equityholder Agent will be entitled, if the Equityholder Agent
so elects by written notice delivered to Parent within fourteen (14) days
after receiving Parent\'s notice of such claim, to assume the defense thereof,
at the sole expense of the Equityholders, independent of the Escrow Fund, with
counsel chosen by the Equityholder Agent and reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, so long as:

(i)Parent has determined reasonably and in good faith that Losses which may be
incurred as a result of the Third Party Claim (taking into account if the
amount of Losses specified in such Third Party Claim is less than the Escrow
Fund) are not reasonably expected to exceed either individually, or when
aggregated with all other actual or reasonably anticipated Third Party Claims,
the total dollar value of the Escrow Fund;

(ii)the Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages; and

(iii)if the Third Party Claim pertains to Taxes, Parent has reasonably
determined that the resolution will not (A) affect the Taxes of any entity
other than the Surviving Corporation (or its subsidiaries as of the date
hereof) (B) will not affect Taxes of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
their subsidiaries for any period ending after the Closing Date, and (C) and
will not require disclosure of Tax information with respect to Parent or its
subsidiaries (other than Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries as of the
date hereof) that is confidential.

(b)If the Equityholder Agent so assumes any such defense, the Equityholder
Agent shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim in good faith. The
Equityholder Agent shall not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or
consent to entry of any judgment in respect thereof without the prior written
consent of Parent and/or any of its affiliates, as applicable, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such compromise or
settlement requires only the payment of monetary damages that are paid in full
from the Escrow Fund.

(c)In the event that the Equityholder Agent assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.2(a), Parent or any of its affiliates
may retain separate counsel and participate in the defense of the Third Party
Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
Parent unless Parent or such affiliate shall reasonably determine after
consultation with counsel that there is a conflict of interest between or
among Parent or affiliate of Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholder
Agent and the Equityholders, on the other hand, with respect to such Third
Party Claim, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
will be paid out of the Escrow Fund if any Losses related to such Third Party
Claim are determined to be indemnifiable Losses in accordance with this
Article VII. Parent will, at the Equityholders\' expense, cooperate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim Such cooperation shall include, without
limitation, (i) assisting in the collection and preparation of discovery
materials, (ii) meeting with (and making employees available to meet with) the
Equityholder Agent and/or its counsel to prepare for and/or appear as
witnesses at depositions, court proceedings and/or trial and (iii) providing
to the Equityholder Agent and/or its counsel all information under the control
of the Parent, Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries that is reasonably
deemed necessary by the Equityholder Agent and/or its counsel for the defense
or prosecution of such matter.

(d)In the event that the Equityholder Agent does not or may not assume the
defense of a Third Party 

Claim, Parent shall reasonably consult with the Equityholder Agent prior to
the settlement of any such claim and discuss with the Equityholder Agent in
good faith any input regarding the claim and potential settlement the
Equityholder Agent may have prior to any settlement (in each case, to the
extent the terms thereof are not subject to a confidentiality agreement with
the claimant). After such consultation (or in the event that Parent is
prohibited from consulting or the Equityholder Agent elects not to consult
with Parent), Parent shall have the right to settle any such claim, even if
the terms thereof are inconsistent with those proposed or advocated by the
Equityholder Agent; provided, however, that, except with the prior written
consent of the Equityholder Agent, no settlement of any such claim or consent
to entry of any judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim shall alone be
determinative of the validity or amount of the Third-Party Claim as an
indemnifiable claim. If the Equityholder Agent consents to the general
economic terms of such settlement, the settlement of any such Third Party
Claim shall be determinative of the amount of any claim for Losses and no
Equityholder shall have any power or authority to object under any provision
of this Article VII to the settlement or the amount of any claim for Losses by
Parent against the Escrow Fund or otherwise with respect to such settlement to
the extent the amount of Losses claimed are consistent with the terms of such
settlement.

ARTICLE VIII

9.4 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries; Assignment. This Agreement,
the schedules and exhibits hereto, and the documents and instruments and other
agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the

matters hereof and thereof and supersede in their entirety any prior or

9.5 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application

in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
express intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree that any such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be deemed replaced
with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

9.6 Remedies; Exercise of Rights. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such party hereunder
or at law or in equity, and the exercise by any party of any one remedy at any
time will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy at the same time, at
another time, or in different circumstances. No failure or delay by any party

waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof (or failure to
exercise) preclude any other, further or fuller exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to

or state courts located in the State of Delaware and each party hereto hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably submits and consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that service of process
on such party as provided in Section 9.1 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. In 

addition to any damages or other recovery to which a party may be entitled
hereunder or at law or in equity (including any right to recoup Losses from
the Escrow Fund), the prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement
or to seek any right or remedy available hereunder or at law or in equity
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\'s fees and costs incurred in
connection with such action and any related appeals therefrom.

9.9 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that any failure
of any party to perform its agreements and obligations hereunder or
contemplated hereby will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for
which damages, even if available, will not provide an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief
by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such party\'s
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder.

9.10 Rules of Construction. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement and the applicable Ancillary Agreements shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions hereof or thereof. Accordingly, each party understands and agrees
that the common law principles of construing ambiguities against the drafter
shall have no application to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Each
party hereto acknowledges and agrees that such party has had a full and
complete opportunity to review this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement, to
make suggestions or changes to their terms and to seek independent legal and
other advice in connection herewith and therewith.

the existence of such matter;

(d)"person" means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability

of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit and state and local apportionment
factors of the Company for the Straddle Period shall be allocated to the
period ending on the close of business on the Closing Date on a "closing of
the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the
close of business on the Closing Date. However, (1) exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation and (2) periodic taxes, such as real and personal property taxes,
shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily basis

(f)"subsidiary" or "subsidiaries" of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Entity

other subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%)
of the capital stock the holders of which are generally entitled to vote for
