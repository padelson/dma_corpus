receives or benefits from (or whose Institutional Seller's Group member, in
the case of the Institutional Seller, or whose Connected Persons, in the case
of a Management Seller, receives or benefits from) the Leakage (or, in the
case of Leakage under limb (g), to the extent that it is attributable to such
Leakage) shall, with effect from Closing, on demand by the Purchaser, pay to
the Purchaser on a pound-for-pound basis by way of adjustment to the amount of
the Consideration received by the Relevant Seller an amount in cash equal to

each Seller (other than Alastair Cotton) shall be deemed for the purposes of
this Clause 5.2 to have received its Pro Rata Share of the Leakage. For the

Purchaser directs) on demand (to the extent not paid by the Institutional
Seller pursuant to Clause 5.2.1) such Institutional Investor's pro rata share
of such Leakage (and interest thereon), where "pro rata share" is calculated
based on the proportion that such Institutional Investor's holding of shares
in the Institutional Seller bears to the aggregate amount of all shares in the
Institutional Seller held by the Institutional Investors, in each case, as
such shares are in issue at the date of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

5.3

Leakage and Corresponding Savings 

| 
---|--- 

5.5.1

to the Purchaser in accordance with Clause 5.2 gives rise to any repayment,
refund, credit or saving of or other relief from Tax for the Purchaser's Group
(including a Group Company) and the Purchaser's Group has actually obtained
the benefit of the same, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers of
the amount of such repayment, refund, credit, saving or relief so obtained and
such amount (less any costs reasonably incurred by the Purchaser or the
Purchaser's Group in obtaining the same) shall be treated as follows: 

| 
---|---

|

Method of Payment and Set Off 

| 
---|--- 

13.8.1

|

Any payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in full, without any set
off (other than pursuant to Clause 3.4.3), counterclaim, restriction or
condition and without any deduction or withholding (save for any withholding
or deduction required by law). To the extent that any deduction or withholding
is required by law on any payment or such payment is subject to a charge to
Tax in the hands of the recipient (other than any deduction or withholding or
Tax attributable to the payment of the Consideration), then the party making
such payment shall pay such additional amount as shall be required to ensure
that the net amount received and retained by the recipient (after any
deduction, withholding or Tax, and after giving credit for any Tax relief
obtained by the recipient attributable to such withholding, deduction, Tax, or
in respect of the matter giving rise to the payment) is equal to the full
amount which would have been received and retained by the recipient if no such
deduction or withholding had been required or if the relevant payment had not
been subject to a charge to Tax; provided that no additional amount shall be
payable in respect of a charge to Tax in the hands of the recipient to the
extent that the charge to Tax has already been taken into account in
calculating the amount of the relevant payment. 

| 
---|--- 

13.8.2

|

To the extent that a party has satisfied any liability to make an increased
payment pursuant to Clause 13.8.1 and the recipient has (in the reasonable
determination of the recipient) actually obtained the benefit of any
repayment, refund, credit or saving of or relief from Tax as a result of the
deduction or withholding or Tax in respect of which such increased payment was
made, then, save to the extent already taken into account in calculating the
amount of the increased payment, the recipient shall reimburse to the paying
party such part of the additional amount paid to it under this Clause 13.8 as
the recipient shall determine, acting reasonably, will leave the recipient
(after such reimbursement) in no better and no worse position than the
recipient would have been in if the paying party had not been required to make
such deduction or withholding. 

| 
---|--- 

13.8.3

|

Where any sum constituting an indemnity, compensation, reimbursement or a
payment in respect of a Seller Claim by any party (the "Claimant") to this
Agreement is paid to a person other than the Claimant but is treated as
taxable in the hands of the Claimant, the payer (the "Payer") shall promptly
pay to the Claimant such sum as * * * shall reimburse the Claimant for all Tax suffered by it in respect of the
payment (after giving credit for any Tax relief actually obtained by the
Claimant (or any affiliate of or person with an interest in the Claimant) in
respect of the matter giving rise to the payment), provided that if the
Claimant (or any affiliate of or person with an interest in the Claimant)
shall have changed after the date of this Agreement (i) its Tax residence or
(ii) the permanent establishment to which the rights under this Agreement are
allocated, then the liability of the Payer under this Clause 13.8.3 shall be
limited to that (if any) which it would have been had no such change as
referred to in (i) or (ii) above taken place.

| 
---|--- 

13.8.4

|

Any payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be effected by crediting for
same day value the account specified by the relevant Seller or the Purchaser
(as the case may be) on behalf of the party entitled to the payment
(reasonably in advance and in sufficient detail to enable payment by
telegraphic or other electronic means to be effected) on or before the due
date for payment. 

| 
---|--- 

13.8.5

|

Payment of a sum in accordance with this Clause 13.8 shall constitute a
payment in full of the sum payable and shall be a good discharge to the payer
(and those on whose behalf such payment is made) of the payer's obligation to
make such payment, and the payer (and those on whose behalf such payment is
made) shall not be obliged to see to the application of the payment as between
those on whose behalf the payment is received. 

| 
---|--- 

13.9

|

Costs 

Except where this Agreement provides otherwise, each party shall pay its own
costs and expenses in relation to the negotiation, preparation and

---|--- 

13.10

|

Stamp Duty, Fees and Taxes 

The Purchaser shall bear the cost of all stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax,

and duties or their equivalents in all jurisdictions where such fees, taxes
and duties are payable as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Purchaser shall be responsible for arranging the payment of
such stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, stamp duty land tax and all other
such fees, taxes and duties, including fulfilling any administrative or

with such payment.

| 
---|--- 

13.11

|

VAT 

| 
---|--- 

13.11.1

|

taxable supply for VAT purposes, then (i) the recipient shall provide to the
payer a valid VAT invoice, and (ii) except where the reverse charge procedure
applies, and subject to the provision of a valid VAT invoice in accordance
with (i), in addition to that payment, the payer shall pay to the recipient
any VAT due. 

| 
---|--- 

13.11.2

|

Where, under the terms of this Agreement, a party is liable to indemnify,
compensate or reimburse another party or their Affiliate, in respect of any
costs, charges or expenses (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect
of a Seller Claim), the payment shall include an amount equal to any VAT
properly incurred but not otherwise * * * recoverable by such person or any of their Affiliates (as applicable) (as
determined by the person being indemnified, compensated or reimbursed (as
applicable), acting reasonably and subject to that person and any relevant
Affiliate using all reasonable endeavours to recover such amount of VAT as may
be practicable).
