EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE 
CAPITAL STOCK OF JANUS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

 **Section 3.1** **Effect on Capital Stock of Janus**

 



 

(a) **Conversion of Janus Common Stock and the Merger Sub Common Stock.** As
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Janus or Merger Sub, or the holders of Janus Common Stock (or options
thereon) or of any shares of Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of Janus Common Stock (other than any
shares of Janus Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_)
shall be converted into the right to receive 4.7190 (the **_Exchange Ratio_**
) validly issued, fully paid up Henderson Ordinary Shares, together with cash
in lieu of fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares as specified below, without
interest (the **_Merger Consideration_** ). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Janus Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. As of the
Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (each as
defined herein) representing any shares of Janus Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender thereof, the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(ii) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and, in exchange for the cancellation of the shares of Merger Sub
common stock and the provision of the aggregate Merger Consideration by
Henderson, the Surviving Corporation shall issue an equivalent number of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all
of which shares shall be held by Henderson, and which shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) **Cancellation of Treasury Shares.** Each share of Janus Common Stock then
owned by Janus or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus (or held in the
treasury of Janus) immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) **Adjustment to Merger Consideration.** The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock/share split, reverse
stock split, share consolidation, share subdivision, share bonus issue or
stock/share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Janus Common Stock or Henderson Ordinary Shares, as
applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares
of Janus Common Stock or Henderson Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) **Treatment of the Janus Options and Janus Equity Awards.**

 



 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Janus Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted (as
converted, a **_Converted Stock Option_** ), by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of that Janus Option, into an
option exercisable for that number of Henderson Ordinary Shares equal to the
product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Janus Common Stock for which
such Janus Option was exercisable _multiplied by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of such
Converted Stock Option shall be adjusted so that it is equal to (x) the
exercise price per share of such Janus Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
cent; **provided** , however that the exercise price and the number of
Henderson Ordinary Shares purchasable pursuant to a Converted Stock Option
shall be subject to such adjustments as may be necessary for the foregoing
conversion to satisfy the requirements of Sections 409A, 422 and 424 of the US
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the **_Code_** ) and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.424-1.

 



 

(ii) As of the conversion pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)(i)_, each Converted
Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in
the applicable Janus Equity Plan and the option agreement pursuant to which
the corresponding Janus Option was granted, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time except as otherwise provided in _Section 3.1(d)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) Each Janus RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a Henderson restricted share unit award with respect to
Henderson Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions (including any
continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the aggregate number
of Henderson restricted share units held by each holder (rounded up to the
nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Janus Common Stock subject to such Janus RSU

 



      
 

 



 

Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the (B) Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(iv) Each Janus PSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a Henderson restricted share unit award with respect to
Henderson Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions (including any
continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the aggregate number
of Henderson restricted share units held by each holder (rounded up to the
nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Janus Common Stock subject to such Janus PSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, **provided** that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Janus PSU Award set forth on Section 3.1(d)(iv) of the
Janus Disclosure Schedule (as defined herein), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, unless
otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of Janus, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a Henderson restricted share unit award with
respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions (including
any continuing time-based vesting and/or performance based vesting conditions
applicable in accordance with the terms of the award) under the applicable
plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
with the aggregate number of Henderson restricted share units held by each
holder (rounded up to the nearest whole unit) determined by multiplying (A)
the number of shares of Janus Common Stock subject to such Janus PSU Award
that are earned based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria as
of (or approximate to) the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable award agreement by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(v) Each Janus Restricted Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a restricted
Henderson Ordinary Share award on the terms and conditions (including any
continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and award agreement
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the aggregate number
of restricted Henderson Ordinary Shares held by each holder (rounded up to the
nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Janus Common Stock subject to such Janus Restricted Share Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(vi) Effective as of the Effective Time, Henderson shall (A) assume the Janus
Options, Janus Restricted Share Awards, Janus RSU Awards and Janus

 



      
 

 



 

PSU Awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the **_Janus Equity Awards_** ) in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 3.1(d)_ and (B) for the purpose of complying with this _Section
3.1(d)_(vi), either (i) assume sponsorship of the relevant Janus Equity Plan,
provided that references to Janus therein shall thereupon be deemed references
to Henderson and references to Janus Common Stock therein shall be deemed
references to Henderson Ordinary Shares with appropriate equitable adjustments
to reflect the Transactions or (ii) adopt a new equity plan on materially
equivalent terms to the relevant Janus Equity Plan. Henderson shall take all
necessary or appropriate actions to comply with the terms of _Section
3.1(d)_, including seeking any necessary regulatory or shareholder approvals.
Prior to the Effective Time, Janus shall deliver written notice to each holder
of a Janus Equity Award informing such holder of the effect of the Merger on
the Janus Equity Awards.

 



 

(vii) Except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties in accordance with the
following sentence, (A) as of the Effective Time, each outstanding award under
the Januss Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the **_ESPP_** ) shall be converted
on the same basis as Company Options are converted in accordance with _Section
3.1(d)(i)_ and _Section 3.1(d)(ii)_ of this Agreement and (B) prior to the
Effective Time, Janus shall make such amendments to the ESPP as may be
necessary to conform the ESPP to the current requirements of Section 423 of
the Code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Henderson and Janus shall
cooperate with each other to determine the appropriate treatment of the ESPP
in connection with the consummation of the Merger, which may include the
termination of the ESPP upon, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective
Time.

 



 

(viii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Janus or the
appropriate committee thereof shall (i) to the extent required under the Janus
Equity Plans, adopt resolutions providing for the treatment of the Janus
Equity Awards as contemplated by this _Section 3.1(d)_ and (ii) cause no
right to acquire Janus Common Stocks under any Janus Equity Plan to be
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(ix) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Henderson
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) registering a number of Henderson Ordinary Shares necessary
to fulfill Hendersons obligations under this _Section 3.1(d)_. Henderson
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of Henderson Ordinary Shares for delivery with respect to the Janus
Equity Awards assumed by it in accordance with this _Section 3.1(d)_ and
otherwise ratify and give effect to the provisions of this _Section 3.1(d)_.

shall designate a bank, trust company or US or UK nationally recognized
stockholder services provider reasonably acceptable to Janus (the **_Exchange
Agent_** ) for the purpose of exchanging, in accordance with this _ARTICLE
III_, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. In
addition, at or prior to the Effective Time, Henderson or Merger Sub shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
holders of shares of Janus Common Stock, (i) evidence of Henderson Ordinary

sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in immediately
available funds in an amount equal to (1) an amount sufficient to pay any
dividends under _Section 3.2(c)_ _ plus_ (2) if applicable, an amount equal
to such amount to be deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
3.2(e)(iv)_ (such Henderson Ordinary Shares, together with any cash pursuant
to _Section 3.2(c)_ or _Section 3.2(e)_, hereinafter, the **_Exchange
Fund_** ). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay any
dividends under _Section 3.2(c)_ and the net proceeds from the sale of the
Excess Shares (as defined herein) (including pursuant to _Section
3.2(e)(iv)_), Henderson or Merger Sub shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment(s). The
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) **Exchange Procedures.**

 



 

(i) Henderson shall instruct the Exchange Agent to, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than three (3)
Business Days following the Effective Time, mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (a **_Certificate_** ) or book-entry share (a **_Book-Entry
Share_** ) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Janus Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Henderson and Janus agree prior to the Effective Time) and (B) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of fractional

 



      
 

 



 

shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions on Henderson Ordinary Shares in accordance with _Section
3.2(c)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Henderson,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
(which shall include cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in _Section
3.2(e)_) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions
of this _ARTICLE III_ and any amounts that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on Henderson Ordinary
Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_. Henderson shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to mail such amounts to such holders within three (3) Business
Days following the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of or, if applicable,
paid to a person other than the person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition to the registration and, if applicable, payment of such Merger
Consideration that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such registration in the name of
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(ii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive
in respect of dividends or other distributions on Henderson Ordinary Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) **Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.** No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to any Henderson
Ordinary Shares represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_, in each
case

 



       
 

 



 

until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_. Subject to the
effect of Applicable Laws (as defined herein), following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, there
shall be paid to the holder of Henderson Ordinary Shares issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Henderson Ordinary Shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such Henderson Ordinary Shares, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
Henderson Ordinary Shares.

 



 

(d) **No Further Ownership Rights in Janus Common Stock.** All Henderson
Ordinary Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_ shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Janus Common Stock, theretofore represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Janus Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Henderson or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this _ARTICLE III_, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) **Fractional Shares.**

 



 

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Henderson Ordinary
Shares.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Janus Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of Henderson Ordinary
Shares (after aggregating all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (in a US dollar amount),
without interest, in an amount equal to such fraction as determined below. As
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
determine the excess of (i) the number of full Henderson Ordinary Shares
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Henderson for issuance to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii) the aggregate number of full
Henderson Ordinary Shares to be distributed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as the **_Excess
Shares_** ). As soon as practicable

 



      
 

 



 

after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then
prevailing prices on the Exchange, all in the manner provided herein.

 



 

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the Exchange and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or
sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all brokerage commissions,
transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the Exchange Agent
incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
(A) the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by (B) a fraction (1) the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking
into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder)
and (2) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share
interests to which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly
pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this
_Section 3.2(e)_.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 3.2(e)_, Henderson may
elect, at its option exercised prior to the Effective Time, to pay to the
Exchange Agent an amount in cash in US dollars, to be deposited on the first
Business Day following the Effective Time, sufficient for the Exchange Agent
to pay each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fraction of a Henderson
Ordinary Share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled by (B)
the closing price for a Henderson Ordinary Share on the Exchange on the first
Business Day immediately following the Effective Time. In such event, all
references in this Agreement to the net proceeds from the sale of the Excess
Shares and similar references shall be deemed to refer to the payments
calculated in the manner set forth in this _Section 3.2(e)(iv)_.

 



 

(f) **Return of Merger Consideration.** Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)_ or any dividends or other distributions on Henderson Ordinary Shares
in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ that remains undistributed to the holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Henderson, upon demand, and any holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not

 



      
 

 



 

theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter be entitled to
look only to Henderson for payment of their claim for any Henderson Ordinary
Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares.

 



 

(g) **No Liability.** None of Janus, Henderson, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share has not
been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Henderson Ordinary Shares, any cash in
lieu of fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares or any dividends or distributions
with respect to Henderson Ordinary Shares in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined herein), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Henderson, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(h) **Withholding Rights.** Each of Henderson, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(i) **Lost Certificates.** If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Janus Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional Henderson Ordinary Shares,
and unpaid dividends and distributions on Henderson Ordinary Shares
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

 



 

 **Section 4.1** **Representations and Warranties of Janus**

 



 

Except as set forth in any Janus SEC Document (as defined herein) filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the **_SEC_** ) (including all
documents incorporated by reference therein) and publicly available at least
one (1) Business Day prior to the date

 



      
 

 



 

of this Agreement (the **_Janus Filed SEC Documents_**) since January 1, 2015
(excluding any disclosures in any risk factors section, in any section related
to forward-looking statements and other disclosures that are predictive or
forward-looking in nature) or as disclosed in the disclosure schedule
delivered by Janus to Henderson at or prior to the execution and delivery by
Henderson and Merger Sub of this Agreement (the **_Janus Disclosure
Schedule_** ) and making reference to the particular subsection of this
Agreement to which exception is being taken ( **provided** , that such
disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and such
other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other subsections), Janus represents and warrants to
Henderson as follows:

 



 

(a) **Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.** Each of Janus and its
subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized or formed
(as applicable), validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is organized or formed (as applicable) and has the requisite
corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries, for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or to have such power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Janus. Each of Janus and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Janus. Janus has delivered to or made available to Henderson
prior to the date of this Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments
to the Certificate of Incorporation of Janus (the **_Janus Certificate of
Incorporation_** ) and the Bylaws of Janus not filed as of the date of this
Agreement with the Janus Filed SEC Documents.

 



 

(b) **Corporate Authority; Non-contravention.**

 



 

(i) Janus has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to the Janus Stockholder Approval (as defined herein),
to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Janus and the consummation by Janus of the Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Janus,
subject (in the case of the Merger) to the Janus Stockholder Approval and the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the state
of Delaware. The Board of Directors of Janus (at a meeting duly called and
held) has, by the unanimous vote of all directors of Janus: (a) determined
that entering this Agreement and consummating the Transactions, are advisable
and fair to,

 



      
 

 



 

and in the best interests of, Janus and its stockholders; (b) authorized and
approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement by Janus and approved the Transactions; and (c)
recommended the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Janus Common
Stock and directed that this Agreement be submitted for consideration by
Januss stockholders at the Janus Stockholders Meeting (as defined in _Section
6.4_), and such resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in
any way prior to the date hereof. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Janus and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement by Henderson and any other party thereto, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Janus, enforceable against Janus in accordance
with its terms, except that (A) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting or
relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (B) equitable
remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought (collectively, the
**_Enforceability Exceptions_** ).

 



 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
by Janus do not, and the consummation of the Transactions, and compliance with
the provisions of this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the
creation of any pledge, claim, lien, charge, security interest or encumbrance
of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, **_Liens_** ) upon any of the
properties or assets of Janus or any of its subsidiaries, under: (A) the Janus
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of Janus or the comparable
organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries; (B) any loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, trust document, lease, commitment,
contract, instrument or other agreement (each a **_Contract_** ) to which
Janus or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which Janus, any of its
subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets may be bound; or (C)
subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in _Section
4.1(b)(iii)_, any Applicable Laws applicable to Janus or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses, properties or assets, other than,
in the case of _clauses (B)_ and _(C)_ any such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights, losses, restrictions or Liens that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (1) have a Material Adverse
Effect on Janus or (2) prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of
the Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any national, federal, state, local, foreign or
supranational government, any court, administrative, regulatory or other
governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental self-
regulatory agency, commission or authority, whether of the United States, the
United Kingdom, Australia or otherwise (a **_Governmental Entity_** ) is
required by or with respect to Janus or any of its subsidiaries in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
by Janus or the consummation by Janus of the Transactions, except for (A)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the **_HSR Act_** ), and with any other applicable

govern foreign investment or competition, or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization, lessening of
competition or restraint of trade (together with the HSR Act, the **_Antitrust
Laws_** ); (B) the filing with the SEC of (w) a proxy statement relating to
the Janus Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the **_Proxy Statement_** ), (x) a prospectus
relating to the issue of Henderson Ordinary Shares in the United States
pursuant to the Merger (such prospectus, as amended or supplemented from time
to time, the **_Henderson US Prospectus_** ), (y) the registration statement
on the Agreed Form (the **_Registration Statement_** ) and (z) such reports
under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the **_Exchange Act_** ), as may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions; (C) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which Janus and Henderson or
their respective subsidiaries are qualified to do business; (D) such filings
with and approvals of the Exchange to permit the Henderson Ordinary Shares

that are the subject of Section 5.1(e); (F) FINRA Approval and (G) such other
consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the failure of which to be made

(i) The authorized capital stock of Janus consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of
Janus Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00

September 30, 2016 (the **_Janus Measurement Date_** ), (A) 265,500,740 shares
of Janus Common Stock were issued and outstanding (of which

Henderson a revised version of such information, updated as of such date.
Except as would not result in material liability to Janus, each Janus Option
has an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of Janus Common
Stock on a date no earlier than the date of the corporate action authorizing
the grant, and no Janus Option has had its exercise date or grant date delayed
or "back dated."

capital stock of Janus that may be issued as permitted by this Agreement or
otherwise shall be, when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. Except as set forth in
this _Section 4.1(c)_ and except for changes since the Janus Measurement Date
resulting from the issuance of shares of Janus Common Stock pursuant to the
exercise or vesting and settlement, as applicable, of Janus Options, Janus RSU
Awards or Janus PSU Awards or as expressly permitted by _Section 5.1(a)(ii)_,
(A) there are not issued or outstanding (x) any shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of Janus, (y) any securities of Janus or any of its
subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or based
upon the value of, shares of capital stock or voting securities of Janus or
(z) any warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from Janus or any
of its subsidiaries (including any subsidiary trust), or obligations of Janus
or any of its subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, or based upon
the value of, capital stock or voting securities of Janus, and (B) there are
no outstanding obligations of Janus or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase,

 



      
 

 



 

redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such securities.

 



 

(iii) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which Janus or any of its subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock or other equity interests of Janus or its subsidiaries.
Neither Janus nor any of its subsidiaries has granted any preemptive rights,
anti-dilutive rights or rights of first refusal, registration rights or
similar rights with respect to its shares of capital stock that are in effect.

 



 

(d) **Subsidiaries.**

 



 

(i) The subsidiaries set forth on Section 4.1(d)(i) of the Janus Disclosure
Schedule are the only Significant Subsidiaries of Janus. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material

equity interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by
Janus, free and clear of any Liens and free of any other restriction,
including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock or other ownership interests.

 



 

(ii) There are no outstanding (A) securities of Janus or any of its
subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in any of its
subsidiaries, (B) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from
Janus or any of its subsidiaries, or any obligation of Janus or any of its
subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership
interests in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any capital stock, voting securities or ownership interests
in, any subsidiary of Janus or (C) obligations of Janus or any of its
subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such outstanding
securities of subsidiaries of Janus or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, delivered or sold, any such securities.

 



 

(e) **SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.**

 



 

(i) Janus and its subsidiaries have filed or furnished all required material
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2015 (the
**_Janus SEC Documents_** ). As of their respective dates, the Janus SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the **_Securities Act_** ), the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the **_Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_** ), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Janus SEC Documents, and none

 



      
 

 



 

of the Janus SEC Documents when filed and at their respective effective times,
if applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to any
Janus SEC Document, and, to the knowledge of Janus, no Janus SEC Document is
the subject of any outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

 



 

(ii) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Janus and its subsidiaries included in the Janus SEC Documents
(the **_Janus Financial Statements_** ) were prepared in all material respects
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( ** _GAAP_** )
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Janus and its consolidated subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not material and to
any other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto).

 



 

(iii) Except (A) as reflected or reserved against in Januss unaudited balance
sheet as of June 30, 2016 (or the notes thereto) as included in the Janus
Filed SEC Documents, (B) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016
and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, neither Janus nor
any of its subsidiaries has any material liabilities or material obligations
of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would
be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Janus
and its subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto).

 



 

(iv) Janus maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to, in all material respects, provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that
transactions are executed only in accordance with the authorization of
management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Januss properties or assets.
Since January 1, 2015, none of Janus or, to the knowledge of Janus, Januss
independent accountants, the Board of Directors of Janus or its audit
committee has received any oral or written notification of any

 



      
 

 



 

(i) "significant deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting
of Janus, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Janus or (iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of Janus who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Janus.

 



 

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Janus are reasonably designed
to, in all material respects, ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by Janus in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to the management of Janus, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of Janus to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(vi) Neither Janus nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Janus and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Janus or any of its
subsidiaries in Januss or such subsidiarys published financial statements or
other Janus SEC Documents.

 



 

(f) **Information Supplied.** None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Janus specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(i) the Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement is
filed with the SEC, and at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, (ii) the Proxy Statement,
at the date it is first mailed to Januss stockholders or at the time of the
Janus Stockholders Meeting, (iii) the Henderson Shareholder Circular and any
Henderson UK Prospectus, at the time the Henderson Shareholder Circular is
first mailed to the shareholders of Henderson, at the time such Henderson UK
Prospectus is first published and at the time the Henderson shareholders vote
on the resolutions set forth in the Henderson Shareholder Circular, or (iv)
any announcement to any regulatory information service approved by the FCA or
the ASX in connection with the Henderson Shareholder Circular or any Henderson
UK Prospectus will, at such time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material

 



       
 

 



 

fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or
warranty is made by Janus with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by Henderson or any other
third party specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement.

 



 

(g) **Absence of Certain Changes or Events.** From December 31, 2015, through
the date of this Agreement, other than with respect to the Transactions, (i)
the businesses of Janus and its subsidiaries have been conducted in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent
with past practice, (ii) there have been no Effects that, individually or in
the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Janus, and (iii) Janus has not taken any action that, if
taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing
Date, would require the consent of Henderson under _Section 5.1(a)_.

 



 

(h) **Compliance with Applicable Laws; Outstanding Orders.**

 



 

(i) Janus and its subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, registrations,
approvals and similar authorizations of all Governmental Entities that are
required for the operation of the businesses of Janus and its subsidiaries
(the **_Janus Permits_** ) and such Janus Permits are in full force and
effect, except where the failure to have any such Janus Permits or to maintain
such Janus Permits in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Janus.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Janus, Janus and its subsidiaries are
not, and since January 1, 2015 have not been in, and have not received written
notice of, a violation or breach of, or default under, any Janus Permit.

 



 

(ii) Janus, its subsidiaries and their operations are, and at all times since
January 1, 2015 have been, in compliance with the terms of the Janus Permits
and all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules or regulations (collectively,
**_Applicable Laws_** ) applicable to Janus or any of its subsidiaries or
their respective businesses, properties or assets, except where the failure to
be in compliance with such Janus Permits or Applicable Laws, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Janus. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Janus, since
January 1, 2015, neither Janus nor any of its subsidiaries has received
written notice from any Governmental Entity of any violation (or any
investigation with respect thereto) of any Applicable Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Neither Janus nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding

or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (A) have a Material
Adverse Effect on Janus, or (B) prevent or materially delay the consummation
of any of the Transactions.

 



 

(i) **Broker-Dealer; Investment Adviser; Commodity Pool Operator.**

 



 

(i) The Broker-Dealer is and has been, since January 1, 2015: (A) duly
registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and registered, licensed
or qualified in all jurisdictions where such registration, licensing or
qualification is so required by Applicable Law and (B) a member in good
standing of FINRA and each other exchange or self-regulatory organization in
which its membership is required by Applicable Law or any Contracts to which
Janus or any of its subsidiaries (including the Broker-Dealer) are a party in

(iii) None of Janus, its subsidiaries, or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has any material liability with respect to any plan subject to
Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA.

 



 

(iv) Each Janus Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is
qualified and has received a determination letter from the IRS upon which it
may rely regarding its qualified status under the Code and, to the knowledge
of Janus, nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, that
could cause the loss of such qualification or the imposition of any penalty or
Tax liability.

 



 

(v) No Action has been, since January 1, 2015, threatened, asserted,
instituted or, to the knowledge of Janus, is anticipated against any of the

each Janus Plan complies in form and has been maintained and operated in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws, including,
without limitation, ERISA and the Code.

(ix) There are no loans by Janus or any of its subsidiaries to any of their
respective employees, officers, directors or other service providers
outstanding in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(x) The consummation of the Merger alone, or in combination with any other
event, will not (a) trigger or give rise to any liability under any Janus Plan
(including any liability for special, lump sum, or accelerated funding,
payments or contributions) or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any employee director
or other individual service provider of Janus or its subsidiaries (whether
current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries, (b) trigger (or could
reasonably be expected to trigger) the commencement of any investigation by
any competent Governmental Entity with authority in the relevant jurisdiction
in relation to any Janus Plan or (c) trigger the winding

consummation of the Merger, by any employee, director or other individual
service provider of Janus or its subsidiaries under any Janus Plan or
otherwise would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or

Janus nor any of its subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation on or after the
Effective Time for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

 



 

(xi) With respect to each Janus Plan that is mandated by a government other
than the United States or subject to the Applicable Laws of a jurisdiction
outside of the United States, the fair market value of the assets of each such
Janus Plan that is funded, or the liability of each insurer for any such Janus
Plan that is funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
such Janus Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all
current and former participants in such Janus Plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Janus Plan, and no Transaction shall cause such assets
or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. Since
January 1, 2015, each such Janus Plan has been maintained and operated in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable plan document and all
Applicable Laws and other requirements, and if intended to qualify for special
Tax treatment, satisfies all requirements for such treatment.

 



 

(m) **ERISA Plan Asset Matters**. In the event that Janus or any of its
subsidiaries provides services to, or transacts with, Clients or Janus Funds

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Janus: (i) Janus or such
subsidiary (and any person acting on behalf of Janus or such subsidiary) is in
compliance with the applicable requirements or prohibitions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code; and (ii) neither Janus nor such subsidiary nor any
employee or "Affiliate" of such subsidiary (as defined in Part VI(d) of U.S.

under that or any similar Applicable Law during the past three (3) years.

 



 

(ii) Any individual who performs services for Janus or any of its subsidiaries
and who is not treated as an employee for federal income tax purposes by Janus
or its subsidiaries is not an employee under Applicable Laws or for any
purpose including, without limitation, for Tax withholding purposes or Janus
Plan purposes. Janus and its subsidiaries have no liability by reason of an
individual who performs or performed services for Janus or its subsidiaries in
any capacity being improperly excluded from participating in a Janus Plan. If
applicable, each employee of Janus and its subsidiaries has been properly
classified as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under Applicable Laws.

person.

non-U.S. jurisdictions, in any transaction the principal purpose of which was

is required by law to be specifically disclosed to any Taxing Authority.

 



 

(viii) Neither Janus nor any of its subsidiaries, has taken any action, or has
knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.

 



 

(p) **Voting Requirements.** The affirmative vote at the Janus Stockholders
Meeting of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Janus Common

combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section
203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions. As of the
date of this Agreement, no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share

sublicenses, agreements, permissions or otherwise all Intellectual Property
necessary for their operations, as currently conducted or as contemplated by
them to be conducted, except where the failure to own or have such rights,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Janus. The conduct of Januss and its subsidiaries
businesses, as currently conducted or contemplated by them to be conducted,
does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate any of the
Intellectual Property rights of any third party, except for infringements,
misappropriations, dilutions or other violations which, individually or in the

Janus or any of its subsidiaries incurred a Cyber Security Incident which

has been consummated), taken as a whole, is or can be conducted, or (iv) any
material Contract granting "most favored" status that, following the Effective
Time, would be applicable to Henderson (collectively, the **_Janus Material
Contracts_** ). Janus has delivered or made available to Henderson, prior to
the date of this Agreement, true and complete copies of all the Janus Material
Contracts that exist as of the date of this Agreement and have not been filed

valid and binding on Janus (or, to the extent a subsidiary of Janus is a
party, such subsidiary) and is in full force and effect (subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions), and Janus and each subsidiary of Janus have
performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each
Janus Material Contract, except where such noncompliance, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Janus. Neither Janus nor any of its subsidiaries has knowledge of,
or has received written notice of, any material violation or material default
under (nor, to the knowledge of Janus, does there exist any condition that
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such
a violation or default under) any Janus Material Contract. To the knowledge of
Janus, no other

subsection and such other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
also qualifies or applies to such other subsections), Henderson and Merger Sub
jointly and severally represent and warrant to Janus as follows:

 



 

(a) **Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.** Each of Henderson, Merger
Sub and the other subsidiaries of Henderson is a corporation or other legal
entity duly organized or formed (as applicable), validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under
the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or formed (as
applicable) and has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may
be, and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as
to subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized,
existing or in good standing or to have such power and authority, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Henderson. Each of Henderson, Merger Sub and the other
subsidiaries of Henderson is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Henderson.
Henderson has delivered to or made available to Janus prior to the date of
this Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to its memorandum of
association (the **_Henderson Memorandum of Association_** ) and Articles of
Association (the **_Henderson Articles_** ) not filed as of the date of this

wholly-owned subsidiary of Henderson.

shall occur immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement),
to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Henderson and Merger Sub and the consummation by Henderson and Merger Sub
of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Henderson and Merger Sub, subject (in the case
of Henderson) to the Henderson Shareholder Approvals and (in the case of
Merger Sub) to the adoption of this Agreement by Merger Subs sole shareholder
(which adoption shall occur immediately after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement) and to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the

consummating the Transactions, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Henderson and its shareholders; (b) authorized and approved the

delivered by Henderson and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by Janus
and any other party thereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Henderson and Merger Sub, enforceable against Henderson and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except for the Enforceability
Exceptions.

 



 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
by Henderson and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Transactions,

or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the

 



      
 

 



 

properties or assets of Henderson or any of its subsidiaries, under: (A) the
Henderson Memorandum of Association or the Henderson Articles or the
comparable organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries, (B) any
Contract to which Henderson or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which

of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289); (H) the JFSC Approvals and

the Henderson Plans (other than routine claims for benefits and appeals of
such claims), any trustee or fiduciaries thereof, or any of the assets of any
trust of any of the Henderson Plans, or against the Henderson or any of its
subsidiaries in respect of the Henderson Plans.

 



 

(vi) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Henderson, since January 1,
2015, each Henderson Plan complies in form and has been maintained and
operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and Applicable
Laws.

 



 

(vii) No Henderson Plan provides post-retirement health and welfare benefits
to any current or former employee of Henderson or its subsidiaries, except as
required under Applicable Laws.

 



 

(viii) There are no loans by Henderson or any of its subsidiaries to any of
their respective employees, officers, directors or other service providers
outstanding in violation of any Applicable Laws.

 



 

(ix) The consummation of the Merger alone, or in combination with any other
event, will not (a) trigger or give rise to any liability under any Henderson
Plan (including any liability for special, lump sum, or accelerated funding,
payments or contributions) or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any employee director
or other individual service provider of Henderson or its subsidiaries (whether
current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries, (b) trigger (or could
reasonably be expected to trigger) the commencement of any investigation by
any competent Governmental Entity with authority in the relevant jurisdiction
in relation to any Henderson Plan or (c) trigger the winding up or termination
of any Henderson Plan. No amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property), as a result of the consummation of the
Merger, by any employee, director or other individual service provider of
Henderson or its subsidiaries under any Henderson Plan or otherwise would not
be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither Henderson nor any of its
subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation on or after the Effective Time for
any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

 



 

(x) With respect to each Henderson Plan, the fair market value of the assets
of each such Henderson Plan that is funded, or the liability of each insurer
for any such Henderson Plan that is funded through insurance or the book
reserve established for any such Henderson Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations with respect to all current and former participants in

 



      
 

 



 

such Henderson Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most
recently used to determine employer contributions to such Henderson Plan, and
no Transaction shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations. Since January 1, 2015, each such Henderson Plan
has been maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with
the applicable plan document and all Applicable Laws and other requirements,
and if intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, satisfies all
requirements for such treatment.

 



 

(xi) No debt that remains outstanding has been triggered or has become due in
relation to Henderson or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to section 75 or 75A
of the Pensions Act 1995 and neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries has
consented to, or acted or agreed to act as guarantor under any withdrawal or
apportionment arrangement under the Occupational Pension Scheme (Employer
Debt) Regulations 2005, or provided any guarantee in relation to liabilities
under any registered pension scheme.

 



 

(xii) Except for the Henderson Pension Plans (each of which is specifically
identified as such in Section 4.2(l)(i) of the Henderson Disclosure Schedule),
neither Henderson nor any connected or associated person participates or has
participated in any pension scheme (including but not limited to the Henderson
Pension Plans), or been a party to an act or failure to act, which is likely
to give rise to the issuing by the UK Pensions Regulator of a contribution
notice or financial support direction under the Pensions Act 2004.

 



 

(m) **Labor and Employment Matters.**

 



 

(i) Neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to or bound by
any collective bargaining agreement and there are no labor unions, works
councils or other organizations recognized in relation to or representing,
purporting to represent or attempting to represent any employee of Henderson
or any of its subsidiaries. Neither Henderson nor its subsidiaries have
experienced a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (within the meaning of the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) or incurred any liability
under that or any similar Applicable Law during the past three (3) years.

 



 

(ii) Any individual who performs services for Henderson or any of its
subsidiaries and who is not treated as an employee for applicable income tax
purposes by Henderson or its subsidiaries is not an employee under Applicable
Laws or for any purpose including, without limitation, for Tax withholding
purposes or Henderson Plan purposes. Henderson and its subsidiaries have no
liability by reason of an individual who performs or performed services for
Henderson or its subsidiaries in any capacity being improperly excluded from
participating in a Henderson Plan. If

 



      
 

 



 

applicable, each employee of Henderson and its subsidiaries has been properly
classified as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under Applicable Laws.

 



 

(n) **Taxes.** Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Henderson:

 



 

(i) (A) All Tax Returns required to be filed by Henderson and its
subsidiaries, have been timely filed, (B) all such Tax Returns are true,
complete and correct in all respects, (C) all Taxes shown as due and payable
on such Tax Returns, and all Taxes (whether or not reflected on such Tax
Returns) required to have been paid by Henderson and its subsidiaries have
been paid or appropriate reserves have been recorded in the Henderson
Financial Statements, and (D) all Taxes of Henderson or its subsidiaries for
any taxable period (or a portion thereof) beginning on or prior to the Closing
Date (which are not yet due and payable) have, to the extent relevant or
required, been properly reserved for in the Henderson Financial Statements.

 



 

(ii) No written agreement or other written document waiving or extending, or
having the effect of waiving or extending, the statute of limitations or the
period of assessment or collection of any Taxes relating to Henderson or any
of its subsidiaries has been filed or entered into with any Taxing Authority,
and no power of attorney with respect to any such Taxes has been granted to
any person.

 



 

(iii) (A) No audits or enquiries before any Taxing Authority are presently
pending with regard to any Taxes or Tax Return of Henderson or any of its
subsidiaries, as to which any Taxing Authority has asserted in writing any
claim or proposed adjustment, and (B) no Taxing Authority is now asserting in
writing any deficiency or claim for Taxes or any adjustment to Taxes with
respect to which Henderson or any of its subsidiaries may be liable, which has
not been fully paid or finally settled or for which Henderson or the relevant
subsidiary has not properly set aside or reserved for in its accounts for such
purpose.

 



 

(iv) Neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries (A) is a party to or bound
by or has any obligation under any Tax indemnification, separation, sharing or
similar agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among Henderson and its subsidiaries or an agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of business which does not relate
primarily to Taxes), (B) is or has been a member of any consolidated,
combined, unitary or similar group for purposes of filing Tax Returns or
paying Taxes (other than a group comprised solely of subsidiaries of the
Henderson, or Henderson and any of its subsidiaries), (C) has entered into a
closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any predecessor
provision or any similar provision of foreign, state, or local Tax law) or any
other binding agreement with a Taxing

 



      
 

 



 

Authority that would have a material effect on the determination of
Hendersons or any of its subsidiaries liability to Tax in a tax year ending
after the Effective Time or (D) has any liability for the payment of Taxes of
any person (other than Henderson or any of its subsidiaries) as a successor or
transferee.

 



 

(v) None of the assets of Henderson or any of its subsidiaries is subject to
any Liens for Taxes (other than Liens for Taxes that are not yet due and
payable or which are being contested in good faith and, in each case, for
which Henderson or the relevant subsidiary has properly set aside or reserved
for in its accounts.).

 



 

(vi) Neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries has agreed to make or is
required to make any adjustment for a taxable period ending after the
Effective Time by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise.

 



 

(vii) Neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries has engaged (A) in the
case of U.S. jurisdictions, in any "listed transaction," as defined in Section
6707A(c)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) (or any
similar provision of U.S. state or local law), and (B) in the case of non-U.S.
jurisdictions, in any transaction the principal purpose of which was the
avoidance of, or obtaining of an advantage in relation to, Taxes and which is
required by law to be specifically disclosed to any Taxing Authority.

 



 

(viii) Henderson is, and at all times since January 1, 2015 has been,
organized as a public limited company under the laws of Jersey.

 



 

(ix) Henderson is, and at all times since January 1, 2013 has been, Tax
resident solely in the United Kingdom.

 



 

(x) Securities issued by Henderson are not registered in a register kept in
the United Kingdom by or on behalf of Henderson.

 



 

(xi) Neither Henderson nor any of its subsidiaries, has taken any action, or
has any knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.

 



 

(o) **Voting Requirements.** The Henderson Shareholder Approvals and the
Henderson Shareholder De-listing Approval are the only votes of holders of any
securities of Henderson or its subsidiaries necessary to approve and
consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(p) **Takeover Statutes and Charter Provisions.** As of the date of this
Agreement, no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies with
respect to Henderson or any of its subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement or any of

 



      
 

 



 

the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no shareholder
rights plan, "poison pill" antitakeover plan or similar plan in effect to
which Henderson or any of its subsidiaries is subject, party or otherwise
bound.

 



 

(q) **Intellectual Property.**

 



 

(i) Henderson and its subsidiaries own, free and clear of all Liens (except
Permitted Liens), or have the right to use pursuant to valid licenses,
sublicenses, agreements, permissions or otherwise all Intellectual Property
necessary for their operations, as currently conducted or as contemplated by
them to be conducted, except where the failure to own or have such rights,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Henderson. The conduct of Hendersons and its
subsidiaries businesses, as currently conducted or contemplated by them to be
conducted, does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate any
of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party, except for
infringements, misappropriations, dilutions or other violations which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Henderson. No claims are pending or, to the
knowledge of Henderson, threatened in writing adversely affecting Hendersons
or any of its subsidiaries rights in or to the Intellectual Property
necessary for their operations, except for claims that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Henderson. To the knowledge of Henderson, no third party has infringed
upon, misappropriated, diluted, or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property rights of Henderson or any of its subsidiaries, except for
infringements, misappropriations, dilutions or other violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Henderson.

 



 

(ii) Since January 1, 2015: (A) the Henderson IT Systems have not been subject
to any Cyber Security Incident, and (B) to the knowledge of Henderson, no
third party engaged by Henderson or any of its subsidiaries incurred a Cyber
Security Incident which compromised any data held on behalf of Henderson or
any of its subsidiaries, except in the case of (A) and (B) Cyber Security
Incidents that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to Henderson and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(r) **Certain Contracts.** Except as set forth on Section 4.2(r) of the
Henderson Disclosure Schedule, and except for this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Henderson nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any "material contract" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC and assuming
for these purposes the applicability of Regulation S-K on Henderson and its
subsidiaries), (ii) any Contract relating to third party indebtedness for
borrowed money in excess of $10,000,000 or any guarantee thereof, (iii) any
non-competition

any material respect the manner in which, or the localities in which, any
material portion of the businesses of Henderson and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, is or can be conducted, or (iv) any material Contract granting "most
favored" status that, following the Effective Time, would be applicable to
Janus (collectively, the **_Henderson Material Contracts_** ). Henderson has
delivered or made available to Janus, prior to the date of this Agreement,
true and complete copies of all Henderson Material Contracts that exist as of
the date of this Agreement and have not been filed as exhibits to the
Henderson Filed Public Documents. Each Henderson Material Contract is valid
and binding on Henderson (or, to the extent a subsidiary of Henderson is a
party, such subsidiary) and is in full force and effect (subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions), and Henderson and each subsidiary of Henderson
have performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under
each Henderson Material Contract, except where such noncompliance,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Henderson. Neither Henderson nor any of its
subsidiaries has knowledge of, or has received written notice of, any
violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Henderson, does there
exist any condition that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would result in such a violation or default under) any Henderson Material
Contract. To the knowledge of Henderson, no other party to any Henderson
Material Contract is in breach of or default under the terms of any Henderson
Material Contract where such default has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Henderson.

 



 

(s) **Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.** (i) Henderson and its Affiliates,
directors, officers and employees have complied with all Anti-Bribery Laws,

Bribery Law, any Economic Sanctions Law, or applicable US and non-US laws and
regulations relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, or transactions
involving the

to the knowledge of Henderson no such investigation, inquiry or proceeding has
been threatened and there are no circumstances likely to give rise to any such
investigation, inquiry or proceeding.

 



 

(u) **Brokers.** Except for fees payable to Merrill Lynch International and
Centerview Partners UK LLP, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Henderson.

contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or as consented to

through the Closing Date would reasonably be expected to have a Material

(i) With respect to each Janus Public Fund, Janus shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to: (A) as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to the extent required by

 



      
 

 



 

Applicable Law or the terms of any Contract or any organizational document of
such Janus Public Fund, (x) seek the approval of the board of trustees of such
Janus Public Fund (including a majority of the trustees who are not parties to
the applicable New IAA (as defined below) or not interested persons of any
such party) ( ** _Public Fund Board Approval_** ) of a new investment advisory
agreement between such Janus Public Fund and the applicable subsidiary of
Janus (a **_New IAA_** ) in accordance with Section 15 of the Investment
Company Act that (1) subject to the approval of each New IAA by the vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the applicable Janus Public
Fund ( ** _Public Fund Shareholder Approval_** ), becomes effective as of the
Closing Date and (2) contains terms substantially the same as the Janus
Advisory Agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement (or, if amended
after the date hereof as permitted by this Agreement, as in effect on the date
of such amendment), and (y) request such Janus Public Funds board of trustees
recommend approval of such New IAA to the shareholders of such Janus Public
Fund; (B) request the board of trustees of such Janus Public Fund call a
meeting of the shareholders of such Janus Public Fund to approve the New IAA

Janus Public Fund of a New IAA is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, seek
Public Fund Board Approval of an "interim contract" (within the meaning of
Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act) between such Janus Public Fund
and the applicable subsidiary of Janus that contains terms substantially the
same as, and does not provide for compensation greater than the compensation
provided under, the Janus Advisory Agreement in effect on the date of this
Agreement (or, if amended after the date hereof as permitted by this
Agreement, as in effect on the date of such amendment thereof) as required by
Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act.

 



 

(ii) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt of each
Public Fund Board Approval described in _Section 5.1(e)(i)_, Janus or one of
its subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to request the board of
trustees of each Janus Public Fund to: (A) prepare and file proxy materials,
including a proxy statement and any supplemental proxy solicitation materials
as may be reasonably required to obtain shareholder approval, for a
shareholder meeting of such Janus Public Fund for the purpose of voting on the
approval of the New IAA for such Janus Public Fund (such proxy materials, a
**_Public Fund Proxy Statement_** and such shareholder meeting, a **_Public
Fund Shareholder Meeting_** ); (B) in accordance with Applicable Law, cause a
Public Fund Proxy Statement to be timely filed with the SEC and mailed to the
shareholders of such Janus Public Funds as of the record date established by
the Janus Public Funds board of trustees for such Janus Public Fund
Shareholder Meeting; and (C) duly call, convene and hold such Janus Public
Funds Public Fund Shareholder

 



      
 

 



 

Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the
Public Fund Proxy Statement. Janus shall use its reasonable best efforts to
request the board of trustees of each Janus Public Fund to solicit from the
shareholders of each Janus Public Fund proxies in favor of the approval of its
New IAA ( ** _Public Fund Shareholder Approval_** ), which efforts may include
the use of supplementary materials. Each of Janus and Henderson shall have the
right to review in advance and to approve (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) all the information relating to it or its affiliates
proposed to appear in (A) any proxy statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto submitted to the SEC or such other applicable Governmental Entity in
connection with the approvals contemplated by this _Section 5.1(f)_ or (B)
any other materials sent or made available to shareholders of any Janus Public
Fund in connection with such approvals. In addition, Janus shall respond in a
timely manner to any SEC comments to the proxy materials.

 



 

(iii) Henderson shall cooperate with Janus and its subsidiaries in taking the
actions and obtaining the approvals described in _Section 5.1(e)(i)_ and
_Section 5.1(e)(ii)_, and shall furnish to Janus, its subsidiaries and
respective Representatives (as defined herein) such information and assistance
as Janus, its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may reasonably
request in connection with seeking the Public Fund Board Approval and the
Public Fund Shareholder Approval for each Janus Public Fund, including making
the directors, officers and employees of Henderson and its subsidiaries
reasonably available for presentations to such Janus Public Funds board of
trustees and for assisting, at Januss, its subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives request, in the preparation of the proxy statements, any
presentations or other materials, or any communications to be made to such
Janus Public Funds board of trustees in furtherance of taking the actions and
obtaining the approvals described in _Section 5.1(e)(i)_. Each party agrees
that none of the information supplied by or on behalf of it in writing
expressly for use in the proxy statement to be filed with the SEC in
connection with obtaining the Public Fund Shareholder Approvals, as amended or
supplemented by any amendment or supplement filed with the SEC, will, at the
date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Janus Public Funds or at
the time of the shareholder meeting of the Janus Public Funds held to obtain
the Public Fund Shareholder Approvals, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 



 

(iv) Henderson acknowledges that Janus is entering into this Agreement in
reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act. Henderson shall not take, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to take, any action that would have the effect, directly or
indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of the provisions of Section

 



       
 

 



 

15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be met in respect of the
Transactions, and shall not fail to take, and, after the Closing, shall cause
its Affiliates not to fail to take, any action if the failure to take such
action would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the
requirements of any of the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment
Company Act not to be met in respect of the Transactions. In that regard,
Henderson shall conduct its business and shall cause each of its affiliates to
conduct its business so as to assure that:

 



 

(A) for a period of not less than three years after the Closing, at least 75%
of the members of the boards of trustees of each Janus Public Fund are not (I)
"interested persons" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment
Company Act) of the investment adviser of such Janus Public Fund after the
Closing or (II) "interested persons" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19)
of the Investment Company Act) of the investment adviser of such Janus Public
Fund immediately prior to the Closing; and

 



 

(B) for a period of not less than two years after the Closing, there shall not
be imposed on any Janus Public Fund an "unfair burden" (as set forth and
described in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) as a result of the
Transactions, or any express or implied terms, conditions or understandings
applicable thereto.

 



 

(f) **U.S. Public Fund Reorganizations.**

 



 

(i) Each party shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to, cooperate with each other to consummate the reorganization (each,
a **_Fund Reorganization_** ) of the U.S. mutual funds sponsored by Henderson
or its subsidiaries with the Janus Public Funds (each, a ** _Reorganized
Fund_** ), as agreed between Janus and Henderson, as of the Effective Time
(including the preparation and filing of the necessary registration statement
and/or prospectus or proxy statement (each, a **_Prospectus/Proxy Statement_**
)). In furtherance thereof, each party shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to: (A) as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, (1) seek the approval of the board of trustees of each
Reorganized Fund ( ** _Fund Board Reorganization Approval_** ) of the
applicable Fund Reorganization and (2) to the extent that approval by
shareholders of such Reorganized Fund is required, request the Reorganized
Funds board of trustees to recommend approval of the applicable Fund
Reorganization to the shareholders of the applicable Reorganized Fund and (B)
to the extent that approval by shareholders of such Reorganized Fund is
required, request the board of trustees of each Reorganized Fund to call a
meeting of the shareholders of applicable Reorganized Fund for the purpose of
voting on the approval of the Fund Reorganization for such Reorganized Fund
(such shareholder meeting, a **_Fund Reorganization Shareholder Meeting_** ),
such meeting to

 



      
 

 



 

occur as soon as practicable, subject to the requirements of Applicable Law,
following the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt of each Fund
Board Reorganization Approval in Section 5.1(f)(i), each party shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to, request the
board of trustees of each Reorganized Fund to: (A) with respect to each
Reorganized Fund that is an acquiring fund, prepare and file the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement for such Fund Reorganization; (B) to the extent
that approval by shareholders of such Reorganized Fund is required, in
accordance with Applicable Law cause a Prospectus/Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the shareholders of the applicable Reorganized Fund as of the record date
established by the Reorganized Funds board of trustees for such Fund
Reorganization Shareholder Meeting; and (C) to the extent that approval by
shareholders of such Reorganized Fund is required, duly call, convene and hold
such Reorganized Funds Fund Reorganization Shareholder Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement. With respect to each Reorganized Fund for which approval by
shareholders is required to implement a Fund Reorganization, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to request the board of trustees of such
Reorganized Fund to solicit from the shareholders of proxies in favor of the
approval of its Fund Reorganization. Each of Janus and Henderson shall have
the right to review in advance and to approve (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) all the information relating to it or its affiliates
proposed to appear in (A) any Prospectus/Proxy Statement or any other proxy
statements or materials or any amendment or supplement thereto submitted to
the SEC or such other applicable Governmental Entity in connection with the
approvals contemplated by this Section 5.1(f) or (B) any other materials sent
or made available to shareholders of any Reorganized Fund in connection with
such approvals.

 



 

(iii) Each party shall cooperate with the other party and its subsidiaries in
taking the actions and obtaining the approvals described in Section 5.1(f) and
shall furnish to each other, its subsidiaries and respective Representatives
(as defined herein) such information and assistance as the other party, its
subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may reasonably request in
connection with seeking the approval described in this Section 5.1(f),
including making directors, officers and employees of such party and its
subsidiaries reasonably available for presentations to the Reorganized Funds
board of trustees and for assisting, at the other partys, its subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives request, in the preparation of
Prospectus/Proxy Statements or any other proxy statements or materials, any
presentations or other materials, or any communications to be made to a
Reorganized Funds board of trustees or shareholders or otherwise in
furtherance of taking the actions and obtaining the approvals described in
Section 5.1(f). Each party agrees that none of the information

 



      
 

 



 

supplied by or on behalf of it in writing expressly for use in (i) any
registration statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with the Fund
Reorganizations, as amended or supplemented by any amendment or supplement
filed with the SEC, will, on its effective date, at the time of the applicable
Fund Reorganization Shareholder Meeting and on the closing date of the
applicable Fund Reorganization Shareholder Meeting contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading; and (ii) in any Prospectus/Proxy Statement or any other proxy
statement or materials to be filed with the SEC in connection with obtaining
the approvals described in Section 5.1(f) will, at the date it is first mailed
to the shareholders of the Reorganized Funds and at the time of the
shareholder meeting of the Reorganized Funds held to obtain the approval by
the shareholders of the Reorganized Funds of the Fund Reorganizations, contain

 **Section 5.2** **No Solicitation by Janus**

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including this _Section
5.2_), Janus shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled
Affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative (a
**_Representative_** ) retained by it or any of its controlled Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by furnishing information in connection with
any inquiry or proposal with respect to a Janus Alternative Transaction (as
defined herein)), or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate,
any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Janus Alternative Transaction, (ii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Janus Alternative Transaction, except
to notify such person (or group of persons) as to the existence of the
provisions of this _Section 5.2_, or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if,
at any time prior to obtaining the Janus Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Janus determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK nationally recognized reputation)
that any such proposal that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 5.2(a)_ constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Janus Superior Proposal (as defined herein), subject to compliance with
_Section 5.2(c)_, Janus and its Representatives may (A) furnish information
with respect to Janus and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources) (
**provided** that all such information has previously been provided to
Henderson or is promptly provided to Henderson prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time

 



      
 

 



 

it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms as to confidentiality (it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement need not include any "standstill" or other
similar terms that prohibit the counterparty thereto or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives from making any proposal for a Janus Alternative
Transaction, acquiring Janus or taking any other similar action, but shall not
prohibit Janus from providing information to Henderson prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, as
provided above) that are generally no less restrictive to such person (or
group of persons) than the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated June
24, 2016, as amended, entered into between Janus and Henderson (the
**_Confidentiality Agreement_** ), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources).

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, **_Janus Alternative Transaction_** means any
of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person
(or group of persons) other than Henderson or its subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub) (such person (or group of persons), a **_Janus Third Party_** ),
acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Janus Common Stock or securities (or options, rights
or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of Janus,
whether from Janus or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or
otherwise, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other transaction
pursuant to which any Janus Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, assets or businesses of Janus or any of its subsidiaries
representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case
on a consolidated basis) of Janus and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or
(iii) any disposition of assets to a Janus Third Party representing 20% or
more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated
basis) of Janus and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.2(b)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Janus nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to make,
in each case in a manner adverse to Henderson, the approval or recommendation
by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement,
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Janus Alternative Transaction (any action in _clause (i)_ or this _clause
(ii)_ being referred to as a **_Janus Recommendation Change_** ) (
**provided** , that nothing herein shall restrict or otherwise limit Janus
from making accurate disclosure to its stockholders of factual information
regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of Janus
or, so long as Janus provides Henderson with reasonable advance notice and a
copy of the proposed disclosure, the fact that a proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Janus Alternative Transaction has been made, the
identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms of such
proposal (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Janus

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change), so long as none of the disclosure through which such
factual information is conveyed, individually or in the aggregate, is contrary
to or materially inconsistent with, in any respects, the recommendation made
by the Janus Board of Directors), or (iii) cause Janus or any of its
controlled Affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any Janus
Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section 5.2(a)_). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the
event that, prior to obtaining the Janus Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Janus determines in good faith, after it has received a proposal
that if consummated would be a Janus Superior Proposal (and after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK nationally recognized
reputation) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of Janus may (subject to compliance with this and the following
sentences in this _Section 5.2(b)_) effect a Janus Recommendation Change from
and after the day that is after the fourth Business Day following Hendersons
receipt of written notice from Janus advising Henderson that the Board of
Directors of Janus has received a Janus Superior Proposal specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Janus Superior Proposal, identifying the
person making such Janus Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make
a Janus Recommendation Change; **provided** that in the event of a subsequent
modification to the material terms and conditions of such Janus Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of Janus may only effect a Janus
Recommendation Change after the later of (x) the fourth Business Day following
Hendersons receipt of the initial written notice advising Henderson of the
Janus Superior Proposal and (y) the second Business Day following Hendersons
receipt of written notice from Janus advising Henderson of the modification to
such terms and conditions; and **provided** further that during such four or
two Business Day notice period, as applicable, Janus engages (to the extent
requested by Henderson) in good faith negotiations with Henderson to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the proposal to enter into a Janus
Alternative Transaction no longer constitutes a Janus Superior Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, a **_Janus Superior Proposal_** means any bona
fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by a Janus Third Party to enter into a Janus
Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of Janus
Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes)
that (A) did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.2(a)_, (B) is on
terms that the Board of Directors of Janus determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK
nationally recognized reputation) to be superior, from a financial point of
view, to Januss stockholders than the Transactions, taking into account all
terms and conditions of such proposal (including any changes to this Agreement
that may be proposed by Henderson in response to such proposal to enter into a
Janus Alternative Transaction), and (C) the conditions to the consummation of
which are reasonably capable of being satisfied and is otherwise reasonably
likely to be consummated, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal
and other aspects of such

 



      
 

 



 

proposal. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Janus Stockholder Approval,
if the Board of Directors of Janus determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK
nationally recognized reputation) that it is required to do so pursuant to its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Janus may
effect a Janus Recommendation Change, but only at a time that is after the
fourth Business Day following Hendersons receipt of written notice from Janus
advising Henderson of all material information with respect to the basis for
any such Janus Recommendation Change and stating that it intends to make a
Janus Recommendation Change and providing its rationale therefor.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Janus set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ and
_Section 5.2(b)_, Janus shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of
receipt thereof, advise Henderson orally and in writing of any request for
substantive information or of any proposal relating to a Janus Alternative
Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such
request or proposal. Janus shall (i) keep Henderson reasonably informed of the
status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request or proposal on a current basis and (ii) provide to Henderson as soon
as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
material substantive correspondence and other material written materials
exchanged between Janus or its subsidiaries or any of their Representatives,
on the one hand, and any person making such request or proposal, on the other
hand, in each case that describes in any material respect any of the material
terms or conditions of any such request or proposal.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit Janus or the Janus
Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) otherwise complying with
Applicable Law; **provided** , however, that any disclosure or statement that
constitutes or contains a Janus Recommendation Change shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_.

 



 

 **Section 5.3** **No Solicitation by Henderson**

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including this _Section
5.3_), Henderson shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its
controlled Affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Representatives
retained by it or any of its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by furnishing information in connection with any inquiry
or proposal with respect to a Henderson Alternative Transaction (as defined
herein)), or knowingly take any other action designed to

 



      
 

 



 

facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Henderson Alternative Transaction,
(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Henderson Alternative
Transaction, except to notify such person (or group of persons) as to the
existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_, or (iii) resolve, propose
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Henderson Shareholder
Approvals, the Board of Directors of Henderson determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK
nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result
from a material breach of this _Section 5.3(a)_ constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Henderson Superior Proposal (as defined
herein), subject to compliance with _Section 5.3(c)_, Henderson and its
Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to Henderson and its
subsidiaries to the person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and its
Representatives and financing sources) ( **provided** that all such
information has previously been provided to Janus or is promptly provided to
Janus prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing
terms as to confidentiality (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not include any "standstill" or other similar terms that
prohibit the counterparty thereto or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
from making any proposal for a Janus Alternative Transaction, acquiring Janus
or taking any other similar action, but shall not prohibit Henderson from
providing information to Janus prior to or substantially concurrent with the
time it is provided to such person, as provided above) that are generally no
less restrictive to such person (or group of persons) than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons) making such
proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources).

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, **_Henderson Alternative Transaction_** means
any of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any
person (or group of persons) other than Janus or its subsidiaries (such person
(or group of persons), a **_Henderson Third Party_** ), acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the issued and outstanding
Henderson Ordinary Shares or securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 20% or more of the voting power of Henderson, whether from
Henderson or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange or other transaction pursuant to which
any Henderson Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
assets or businesses of Henderson or any of its subsidiaries representing 20%
or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated
basis) of Henderson and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iii) any
disposition of assets to a Henderson Third Party representing 20% or more of
the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of
Henderson and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.3(b)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Henderson nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to
make, in each case in a manner adverse to Janus, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Henderson
Share Issuance, the Henderson Name Change, the Henderson Amended Articles, the
Henderson Shareholder De-listing Approval, the Henderson Shareholder Permitted
Henderson Dividend Approval or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Henderson Alternative
Transaction (any action in _clause (i)_ or this _clause (ii)_ being referred
to as a **_Henderson Recommendation Change_** ) ( **provided** , that nothing
herein shall restrict or otherwise limit Henderson from making accurate
disclosure to its stockholders of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Henderson or, so long as
Henderson provides Janus with reasonable advance notice and a copy of the
proposed disclosure, the fact that a proposal the consummation of which would
constitute a Henderson Alternative Transaction has been made, the identity of
the party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and
such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Henderson Recommendation Change),
so long as none of the disclosure through which such factual information is
conveyed, individually or in the aggregate, is contrary to or materially
inconsistent with, in any respects, the recommendation made by the Henderson
Board of Directors), or (iii) cause Henderson or any of its controlled
Affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any Henderson Alternative
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section
5.3(a)_). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event
that, prior to obtaining the Henderson Shareholder Approvals, the Board of
Directors of Henderson determines in good faith, after it has received a
proposal that if consummated would be a Henderson Superior Proposal (and after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Henderson may (subject to compliance
with this and the following sentences in this _Section 5.3(b)_) effect a
Henderson Recommendation Change from and after the day that is after the
fourth Business Day following Januss receipt of written notice from Henderson
advising Janus that the Board of Directors of Henderson has received a
Henderson Superior Proposal specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Henderson Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such Henderson
Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Henderson
Recommendation Change; **provided** that in the event of a subsequent
modification to the material terms and conditions of such Henderson Superior
Proposal, the Board of Directors of Henderson may only effect a Henderson
Recommendation Change after the later of (x) the fourth Business Day following
Januss receipt of the initial written notice advising Janus of the Henderson
Superior Proposal and (y) the second Business Day following Januss receipt of
written notice from Henderson advising Janus of the modification to such terms

 



      
 

 



 

and conditions; and **provided** further that during such four or two Business
Day notice period, as applicable, Henderson engages (to the extent requested
by Janus) in good faith negotiations with Janus to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the proposal to enter into a Henderson Alternative
Transaction no longer constitutes a Henderson Superior Proposal. For purposes
of this Agreement, a **_Henderson Superior Proposal_** means any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a Henderson Third Party to enter into a Henderson
Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of
Henderson Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these
purposes) that (A) did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.3(a)_,
(B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Henderson determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of US
or UK nationally recognized reputation) to be superior, from a financial point
of view, to Hendersons shareholders than the Transactions, taking into
account all terms and conditions of such proposal (including any changes to
this Agreement that may be proposed by Janus in response to such proposal to
enter into a Henderson Alternative Transaction), and (C) the conditions to the
consummation of which are reasonably capable of being satisfied and is
otherwise reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to the receipt of the Henderson Shareholder Approval, if the Board of
Directors of Henderson determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of US or UK nationally recognized
reputation) that it is required to do so pursuant to its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Henderson may effect a
Henderson Recommendation Change, but only at a time that is after the fourth
Business Day following Januss receipt of written notice from Henderson
advising Janus of all material information with respect to the basis for any
such Henderson Recommendation Change and stating that it intends to make a
Henderson Recommendation Change and providing its rationale therefor.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Henderson set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_
and _Section 5.3(b)_, Henderson shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours of receipt thereof, advise Janus orally and in writing of any request
for substantive information or of any proposal relating to a Henderson
Alternative Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or
proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making
such request or proposal. Henderson shall (i) keep Janus reasonably informed
of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such request or proposal on a current basis and (ii) provide to Janus as soon
as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
material substantive correspondence and other material written materials
exchanged between Henderson or its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or any
of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request
or proposal, on the other hand, in each case that describes in any material
respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request or
proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit Henderson or the
Henderson Board of Directors from making any public announcement as referred
to in Rule 2.3(d) of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers; **provided** ,
however, that any disclosure or statement that constitutes or contains a
Henderson Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of _Section
5.3(b)_.

 



 

(e) The parties agree that if the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers determines
that _Section 5.3(b)_ requires Henderson to take or not to take action,
whether as a direct obligation or as a condition to any other persons
obligation (however expressed), that is not permitted by Rule 21.2 of the City
Code on Takeovers and Mergers, that provision shall have no effect and shall
be disregarded (it being agreed and understood that Henderson shall consult
with Janus, to the extent reasonable practicable, in connection with any
discussion with the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers relating to the
foregoing). In the event that the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers makes a
determination, the effect of which is that all or any portion of _Section
5.3(b)_ has no effect or is otherwise disregarded, the parties agree that
_Section 5.2(b)_ shall be amended (without further action by the parties) to
the same extent as _Section 5.3(b)_.

respect to the Registration Statement received from the SEC. Henderson and
Janus shall cooperate and provide the other party and its counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment

 



       
 

 



 

or supplement to the Registration Statement prior to filing such with the SEC,
and with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any
other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including
by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement or the Registration

which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
**provided** that this approval right shall not apply with respect to

information. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Janus, Henderson, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors, should be discovered by Janus or Henderson that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, so that any
part of such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or

party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable
Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Janus and shareholders of Henderson.

 



 

(d) Janus shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Januss stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement Effective Date. Notwithstanding any other provision

available by Henderson) (i) publicly disclose any (A) forecasts relating to
Henderson or the group consisting of Henderson, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective subsidiaries or (B) financial information of Henderson
relating to the 2016 fiscal year of Henderson or (ii) include any forecast or
other financial information of Henderson relating to the 2016 fiscal year of
Henderson in a Proxy Statement filed with the SEC prior to February 28, 2017
unless confidential treatment is afforded to such information, in each case,
without the prior consent of Henderson (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed taking into account market practice for
disclosure in transactions of this type). In the event that any Governmental
Entity requires public disclosure of any of the foregoing information or Janus

Effective Time, to all their respective properties, books, Contracts,
commitments, personnel and records ( **provided**

 



      
 

 



 

that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of such party), and during such period, each of Janus and Henderson
shall, and shall cause each of its respective subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to the other party all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request (including
in respect of developments in relation to key employees and material financial
developments); **provided** , however, that the foregoing shall not require
Janus and Henderson to disclose any information pursuant to this _Section
6.5_ to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such

or prohibit access to any such information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith
judgment of such party, the information is subject to confidentiality
obligations to a third party or (iii) disclosure of any such information or
document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege; **provided** ,

6.5_, Janus or Henderson, as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any third party necessary to

information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Janus or Henderson and (3) in the case of _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ ,
utilize the procedures of a joint defense agreement or implement such other
techniques if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the
disclosure of such information without violating Applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege. No review pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall
affect any representation or warranty given by the other party hereto. Each of
Janus and Henderson shall hold, and shall cause its respective Affiliates,
officers, employees and Representatives to hold, any nonpublic information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.6** **Reasonable Best Efforts**

consult and participate in accordance with the preceding _clauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ , **provided** that materials furnished pursuant to this _Section
6.6(c)_ may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or

 **Section 6.7** **Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance**

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Henderson shall indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Janus or any of
its subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of Janus or any
of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the
**_Indemnified Parties_** ), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the Transactions)),
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer or director of Janus or any of its subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of Janus or any of its subsidiaries as a director or
officer of another person or in respect of any acts or omissions in their
capacities as such directors of officers occurring prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Indemnified Parties are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by Janus pursuant to the Janus Certificate of Incorporation,
the Bylaws of Janus or the governing or organizational documents of any
subsidiary of Janus and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the
date of this Agreement. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding, (i) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding
from the Surviving Corporation or Henderson to the same extent as such
Indemnified Parties are entitled to advance of expenses as of the date of this
Agreement by Janus pursuant to the Janus Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws of Janus or the governing or organizational documents of any subsidiary
of Janus; **provided** that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, the Janus
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of Janus, and any indemnification
agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (ii) Henderson shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to,
cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the event that Henderson or

favorable to the insured persons with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event
shall Henderson or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect
to such insurance policies (or substitute insurance policies) of Janus in
respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the annual premium payable by
Janus for such insurance for the prior twelve months (the **_Maximum Amount_**
), and if Henderson or the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 6.7(b)_ it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year
within such period; **provided** that in lieu of the foregoing, Janus may
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
Januss existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, on an annual basis, does not
exceed the Maximum Amount.

with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the base
salary or wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior the Effective Time, and (iii) employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior the Effective Time; _provided_

coverage under a comparable Janus Plan or Henderson Plan, in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the **_Old Plans_** ); and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Henderson or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Henderson or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving

Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year

covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been

establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the ability of

agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them, (iii) create any third-party
beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any Continuing
Employee or former employee) other than the parties to this Agreement or any
right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Henderson or any of its subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation), or (iv) limit the right of Henderson or any of its

after the date hereof against such party or any of its directors (in their
capacity as such) by any stockholders or shareholders of such party (on their
own behalf or on behalf of such party) relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and shall keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any
such litigation. Such party shall give the other party the opportunity to

brought by any stockholders or shareholders, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the other partys prior consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(a) Prior to (a) consummating any transaction that (i) is described in _clause
(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ or _(vi)_ of _Section 5.1(a)_ or in
corresponding sections of the Janus Disclosure Schedule and (ii) is not
subject to Hendersons consent right provided in _Section 5.1(a)_ on the
basis that such transaction involves solely Janus and one or more of its
subsidiaries or solely Januss subsidiaries, or (b) altering any intercompany
arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among Janus and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries or among Januss wholly-owned subsidiaries, in each
case, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent

 



      
 

 



 

with past practice, Janus shall consult with Henderson reasonably prior to
consummating any such transaction and shall not proceed with any such action
or transaction described in _clause (a)_ or _(b)_ hereof without Hendersons
consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if such
action or transaction would, without taking into account any action or
transaction entered into by Henderson or any of its subsidiaries (including,
after the Effective Time, Janus or any of its subsidiaries), reasonably be
expected to have adverse Tax consequences that, individually or in the
aggregate, may constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Janus, or, after the
Effective Time, to Henderson and its subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Prior to (a) consummating any transaction that (i) is described in _clause
(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ or _(vi)_ of _Section 5.1(b)_ or in
corresponding sections of the Henderson Disclosure Schedule and (ii) is not
subject to Januss consent right provided in _Section 5.1(b)_ on the basis
that such transaction involves solely Henderson and one or more of its
subsidiaries or solely Hendersons subsidiaries, or (b) altering any
intercompany arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among
Henderson and its wholly-owned subsidiaries or among Hendersons wholly-owned
subsidiaries, in each case, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, Henderson shall consult with Janus reasonably
prior to consummating any such transaction and shall not proceed with any such
action or transaction described in _clause (a)_ or _(b)_ hereof without
Januss consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if
such action or transaction would, without taking into account any action or
transaction entered into by Janus or any of its subsidiaries (including
actions or transactions after the Effective Time), reasonably be expected to
have adverse Tax consequences that, individually or in the aggregate, may
constitute a Material Adverse Effect to Henderson and its subsidiaries
(including, after the Effective Time, Janus or any of its subsidiaries).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.1(a)_ or _5.1(b)_
(including any actions set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the Janus Disclosure
Schedule or 5.1(b) of the Henderson Disclosure Schedule) or otherwise in this
Agreement, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify as a reorganization described in Sections 368(a)(1)(A)
and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, and none of Henderson, Merger Sub or Janus
shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, take
any action, or fail to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Merger to fail to so qualify; (b) none of Henderson, Merger Sub or
Janus shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries
to, other than as required by this Agreement, take any action that, in
combination with the Merger, causes, or could reasonably be expected to cause,
the ownership threshold of Section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code to be met;
and (c) each of Janus, on the one hand, and Henderson and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall use reasonable best efforts to execute certificates
containing appropriate representations at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by Tax counsel to Janus or Henderson that are in form and
substance acceptable to such counsel, in connection with such counsels
delivery to Janus or such counsels delivery to Henderson, as the case may be,
of an

 



      
 

 



 

opinion or opinions with respect to Code Sections 367, 368, and 7874 rendered
in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(d) The parties further intend that the Merger not be subject to Section
367(a)(1) of the Code by reason of qualifying for the exception provided in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c). Except as otherwise required by a
final "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code),
in any Tax filing or proceeding, the parties shall not take any position
inconsistent with such treatment or the treatment described in _Section
6.19(c)_. The parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to achieve such
treatment for the Merger and to cause the Surviving Corporation to use
reasonable best efforts to achieve such treatment, including satisfying the
documentation, reporting, and filing requirements set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

necessary), any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise in Henderson, any and all right, title and interest in,
to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by Henderson as a result of, or in connection with, the Transactions.

 **Section 8.2** **Effect of Termination; Termination Fee**

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
8.1_, and subject to the provisions of _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of any of the parties, except (i) the provisions of this _Section 8.2_,
the last sentence of _Section 6.5_, _Section 6.8_ and _ARTICLE IX_ shall
survive any such termination of this Agreement and no such termination shall
relieve either party from any liability or obligation under such provisions
and (ii) nothing contained herein shall relieve any party from liability for
any Willful Breach hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If either Janus or Henderson terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, within three (3) Business Days after such termination
Janus shall pay or cause to be paid to Henderson an amount equal to
Hendersons actual out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees and
expenses of financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts,
consultants and other Representatives but excluding any amount of or in
respect of VAT (as defined herein) that is recoverable by Henderson or a
member of the same group for VAT purposes as Henderson) incurred by or on
behalf of Henderson in connection with the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and the Transactions
(the **_Henderson Expenses_** ), such amount not to exceed $10,000,000 (the
**_Expense Cap_** ); **provided** that the payment by Janus of the Henderson
Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_ shall not relieve Janus of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Janus Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.2(d)_ except to the extent indicated in such section (and the credit
referred to below), and shall not relieve Janus from any liability for damages
resulting from a Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or fraud. To the extent a
Janus Termination Fee becomes payable, any payment previously made pursuant to
this _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be credited against such obligation of Janus to
pay the Janus Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, a termination of
this Agreement by Janus or Henderson pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall
not relieve Henderson from any obligation to pay the Janus Expenses under
_Section 8.2(c)_ in the event that the Agreement is terminated at a time when
Janus would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_.

 



 

(c) If either Henderson or Janus terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, within three (3) Business Days after such termination
Henderson shall pay or cause to be paid to Janus an amount equal to Januss
actual out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of
financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts, consultants
and other Representatives but excluding any amount of or in respect of VAT
that is recoverable by Janus or a member of the same group for VAT purposes as
Janus) incurred by or on behalf of Janus in connection with the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and the
Transactions (the **_Janus Expenses_** and, together with the Henderson
Expenses, the **_Expenses Reimbursement_** ), such amount not to exceed the
Expense Cap; **provided** that the payment by Henderson of the Janus Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 8.2(c)_ shall not relieve Henderson of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Henderson Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.2(e)_ except to the extent indicated in such section (and the
credit referred to below), and shall not relieve Henderson from any liability
for damages resulting from a Willful Breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or fraud. To
the extent a Henderson Termination Fee becomes payable, any payment previously
made pursuant to this _Section 8.2(c)_ shall be credited against such
obligation of Henderson to pay the Henderson Termination Fee. For the
avoidance of doubt, a termination of this Agreement by Janus or Henderson
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ shall not relieve Janus from any obligation
to pay the Henderson

 



      
 

 



 

Expenses under _Section 8.2(b)_ in the event that the Agreement is terminated
at a time when Henderson would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) (A) by Henderson pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, or (B) by either Henderson
or Janus pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ at a time when Henderson would have
been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ (in
which case this Agreement shall be deemed terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_ for purposes of this _Section 8.2(d)_),

applicable date set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_, _Section 8.1(c)_, _Section
8.2(d)_ and _Section 8.2(e)_. If a party fails to promptly pay to the other
party any fee due under such _Section 8.1(b)_, _Section 8.2(c)_, _Section
8.2(d)_ and _Section 8.2(e)_, the defaulting party shall pay the costs and

connection with, a Willful Breach hereof), (i) in the event that any
Termination Fee is paid to a party in accordance with this _Section 8.2_, the
payment of such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such
party, its subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees and Representatives against the other party or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates for, and (ii) in no event will the

 



      
 

 



 

party being paid any Termination Fee or any other such person seek to recover
any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or
equity with respect to, in each case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , (A) any
loss suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, (B) the termination of this Agreement, (C) any
liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (D) any claims or
actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or
under this Agreement, and (iii) upon payment of any Termination Fee in
accordance with this _Section 8.2_, no party nor any Affiliates or
Representatives of any party shall have any further liability or obligation to
the other party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions; **provided** that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(h) The parties acknowledge and agree that the amount of the overall loss that
Janus or Henderson may incur in the circumstances in which any Termination Fee
is payable under this _Section 8.2_ is not possible to ascertain as at the
date of this Agreement and that, as such, the Termination Fee represents a
genuine estimate by the parties of the amount of the overall loss that Janus
or Henderson (as the case may be) would incur in the circumstances in which a
Termination Fee is payable to Janus or the Henderson. The parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to secure that any Expenses Reimbursement and
any Termination Fee payable under this _Section 8.2_ (for the purposes of
this _Section 8.2(h)_ a **_Relevant Sum_** ) will not be subject to any tax
imposed in compliance with the Council Directive of 28 November 2006 on the
common system of value added tax (EC Directive 2006/112) and any other tax of
a similar nature whether imposed in a member state of the European Union in
substitution for, or levied in addition to, such tax, or imposed elsewhere (
** _VAT_** ). However, if it is finally determined by a Taxing Authority or
tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction that a Relevant Sum constitutes
all or part of the consideration for a supply made for VAT purposes then if
that VAT is held to be chargeable by the payor of the Relevant Sum (or the
representative member of the VAT group of which the payor is a party) under
the reverse charge mechanism, to the extent that any VAT so chargeable is not
recoverable by such payor (or the representative member of the VAT group of
which the payor is a member) by repayment or credit, the Relevant Sum shall be
reduced so that the aggregate of the Relevant Sum and such irrecoverable
reverse charge VAT equals the Relevant Sum that would have been paid had no
such irrecoverable reverse charge VAT arisen. Such adjusting payment as may be
required between the parties to give effect to this _Section 8.2(h)_ shall be
made five Business Days after the date on which the final determination has
been communicated to the party required to make the payment (together with
such evidence of it as it is reasonable in the circumstances to provide) or,
if later five Business Days before the VAT is required to be accounted for.
The party paying the Relevant Sum shall (or shall procure that the
representative member of the VAT group of which such party is a member shall)
use its reasonable endeavors to obtain any available repayment or credit in
respect of VAT (as referred to in this _Section 8.2(h)_) and for the purposes
of this _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _8.2(h)_ the extent of such repayment or credit shall be determined by such
party, or the relevant representative member of the VAT group, acting
reasonably.

 



 

 **Section 8.3** **Amendment**

 



 

Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time before or after the Janus Stockholder Approval
or the Henderson Shareholder Approvals; **provided** , however, that (a) after
any such approval, there may not be, without further approval of the
stockholders of Janus (in the case of the Janus Stockholder Approval) and the
shareholders of Henderson (in the case of the Henderson Shareholder
Approvals), any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the
form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Janus Common Stock
hereunder or that by Applicable Law otherwise expressly requires the further
approval of the stockholders of Janus or shareholders of Henderson, as the
case may be, and (b) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement
shall be submitted to be approved by the stockholders of Janus or the
shareholders of Henderson. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto and duly
approved by the parties respective Boards of Directors or a duly authorized
committee thereof.

 



 

 **Section 8.4** **Extension; Waiver**

 



 

At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party hereto may, subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.3_ (and for this purpose treating any waiver referred
to below as an amendment), (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the
conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by Janus or
Henderson shall require the approval of the stockholders of Janus or the
shareholders of Henderson, respectively, unless such approval is required by
Applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Any extension or waiver given in
compliance with this _Section 8.4_ or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX 
GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **Section 9.1** **Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties**

 



 

None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any

any covenant or agreement of the parties that,

 



      
 

 



 

by its terms, contemplates performance after the Effective Time or after the

court referred to in _Section 9.10_ below, without proof of actual damages
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

sitting in the State of Delaware and appellate courts thereof. Each party

jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 9.10_ in any such
Action by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United States
