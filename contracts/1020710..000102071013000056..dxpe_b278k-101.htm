Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Schedule 2.2(a)(i)
of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter (other than the Side Letters)
cannot be changed after the date hereof without Buyer's written consent,
except as provided therein.

  

  

The Gross Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to subsection (ii) through (vii)
above is referred to herein as the "Adjusted Gross Purchase Price." The
Adjusted Gross Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Sellers in
accordance with Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure
Letter. Exhibit D is a sample calculation of the Adjusted Gross Purchase
Price. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, no fee, expense or other amount shall be deducted from the
Gross Purchase Price more than once.

  

  

(b) Estimates at Closing. The Company and the Parent shall deliver to the
Buyer no more than ten, and no less than five, Business Days prior to the

to the Gross Purchase Price (such net amount, the "Closing Amount") and
Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(c) Payments of Closing Amount; Escrow. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, at the Closing, the Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Closing Amount which shall be payable as follows:

  

  

(i) Buyer shall deposit with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to:

  

  

(A) $16,345,000 (together with all earnings generated thereon, the "Escrow
Amount");

  

  

(B) $2,000,000 (together with all earnings generated thereon, the "Working
Capital Escrow Amount"); and

  

  

(C) $5,000,000 (together with all earnings generated thereon, the "Special
Escrow Amount").

  

  

The Escrow Amount shall constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") and the
Working Capital Escrow Amount shall constitute a working capital escrow fund
(the "Working Capital Escrow Fund"), each governed by the terms of the escrow
agreement by and among Buyer and the Representatives, in the form of Exhibit B
hereto (as the same may be amended, modified or restated, the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Special Escrow Amount shall constitute a special escrow fund
(the "Special Escrow Fund") governed by the terms of the escrow agreement by
and among Buyer and the Representatives, in the form of Exhibit G hereto (as
the same may be amended, modified or restated, the "Special Escrow
Agreement"). The Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow and shall be available to
pay any amounts payable to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; provided, with
respect to any amounts payable to Buyer under Section 2.5, the Buyer shall
first seek payment out of the Working Capital Escrow Fund before making any
claim under the Escrow Fund. With respect to any amounts payable to Buyer
under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (ii) with respect to a breach or inaccuracy of
Section 5.22, the Buyer shall seek payment solely out of the Special Escrow
Fund and will not make any claim under the Escrow Fund. The Working Capital
Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow and shall be available solely to pay any
amounts payable to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.5; provided, that the Sellers
shall remain liable for the full amounts owed to Buyer pursuant to Section
2.5, even to the extent that such amounts exceed the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, to the extent set forth in Article X hereof; with any amount of
Working Capital Escrow Fund in excess of what is due to Buyer to be
distributed to the Working Capital Escrow Fund recipients set forth and in the
percentages listed on Exhibit C to Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter contemporaneously with any payment to Buyer
pursuant to this sentence. The Special Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow and
shall be available solely to pay any amounts payable to Buyer under Section
10.2(a)(i) or (ii) with respect to a breach or inaccuracy of Section 5.22;
with any amount of the Special Escrow Fund in excess of what is due to Buyer
to be distributed to the Special Escrow Fund recipients set forth and in the
percentages listed on Exhibit C to Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter.

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

If the sum of (i) Net Working Capital and Cash is finally determined (in
accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 2.5) to be greater than or
equal to the sum of (ii) Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Closing
Cash, then the Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be released to, and Buyer
shall pay such difference to, the Sellers within three Business Days of such
final determination. Any amounts released to Sellers from the Working Capital
Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the recipients set forth and in the
percentages listed on Exhibit C to the Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter, and any additional amounts to be paid by Buyer
pursuant to the prior sentence, shall be promptly paid by Buyer to the
recipients set forth and in the percentages listed on Exhibit D to Schedule
2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter. If the sum of (i) Net
Working Capital and Cash is finally determined (in accordance with the terms
and conditions of Section 2.5) to be less than the sum of (ii) Estimated Net
Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Cash, then such difference shall be
released from the Working Capital Escrow Fund and be paid to Buyer within
three Business Days of such final determination, and any remaining Working
Capital Escrow Amount shall be released and paid to the recipients set forth
and in the percentages listed on Exhibit C to Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the
Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Working Capital Escrow Fund is not sufficient to pay Buyer the
required difference, then each of the Sellers shall pay Buyer their Pro Rata
Share of such difference within 15 Business Days after such determination on
the terms and subject to the limitations set forth in Article X hereof.

  

  

(ii) The Transaction Bonuses as adjusted pursuant to Schedule 2.9 shall be
paid to the Company, and the Company shall pay such amount to the applicable
recipients, net of applicable withholding taxes, on the next regularly
scheduled pay date after the Closing Date.

  

  

(iii) A number of shares of the unregistered common stock of Buyer,
hereinafter referred to as "Buyer's Stock" will be issued to the Buyer's Stock
Recipients, which number of shares issuable to each Buyer's Stock Recipient
shall be determined in accordance with Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter. The dollar amount of consideration for each share
to be received pursuant to Schedule 2.2(a)(i) shall be the lesser of (A) the
average per share closing price of a share of Buyer common stock on NASDAQ for
the last 20 trading days immediately prior to the third Business Day prior to
the date of this Agreement, or (B) the average per share closing price of a
share of Buyer common stock on NASDAQ for the last 3 trading days immediately
prior to the third Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement less two
percent (2%).

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) The remainder of the Closing Amount shall be paid to the Sellers in
accordance with Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure
Letter, taking into account the issuance of Buyer common stock described in
Section 2.2(c)(iii) above, which remainder shall be allocated among the
Sellers as determined in accordance with Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(d) Consideration to Parent Shareholders. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein, each Parent Shareholder shall be entitled to:

allocated among such Sellers in accordance with Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the
Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(e) Consideration to the Madison Group Sellers. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein, each Madison Group Seller shall be entitled to:

Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter, taking into
account the issuance of Buyer's Stock described in Section 2.2(c)(iii) above;
and

  

  

(ii) a contingent right to receive, if, when, and to the extent payable, any
disbursement(s) to the Madison Group Sellers of the Escrow Fund, the Working
Capital Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund, which amounts shall be
allocated among such Sellers as in accordance with Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the
Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter.

  

  

2.3 Closing. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by each of the parties
hereto, the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (the "Closing")
shall take place remotely via the exchange of documents and concurrent release
of executed signature pages, on a date to be specified by the parties which
shall be the later of (i) January 1, 2014 (with funding occurring on January
2, 2014) or (ii) no later than three Business Days after satisfaction (or

2.5 Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount.

  

  

(a) For purposes of this Section 2.5, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned to them in this Section 2.5(a):

  

  

(i) "Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount" means, as of the Effective
Time, the sum of the adjustments provided in Section 2.5(b) and Section
2.5(c).

  

  

(ii) "Cash" means cash, certificates of deposit and bank deposits as reflected
in the bank statements of the Acquired Companies and the Parent.

  

  

(iii) "Current Assets" means the items set forth on Exhibit A hereto as
Current Assets, other than Cash.

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) "Current Liabilities" means the items set forth on Exhibit A hereto as
Current Liabilities.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Acquired Company is obligated to pay,
following the Closing Date, any portion of Indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies (other than letters of credit that fall within the definition of
Continuing Indebtedness) or the Sellers' Transaction Expenses that are neither
paid at or prior to Closing nor subtracted from the Gross Purchase Price at
the Closing pursuant to Section 2.2(a), then such portion will be deemed to be
a "Current Liability" for purposes of the calculation of Adjusted Net Working
Capital Closing Amount pursuant to this Section 2.5(a).

  

  

(b) (i) If Net Working Capital is greater than Estimated Net Working Capital,
then Buyer shall owe to the Sellers (in each case in the percentages set forth
on Exhibit D to Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure
Letter) an aggregate amount equal to the amount by which Net Working Capital
exceeds Estimated Net Working Capital or (ii) if Net Working Capital is less
than Estimated Net Working Capital, then Buyer shall be owed the amount by
which Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds Net Working Capital.

  

  

(c) (i) If Cash is greater than Estimated Closing Cash, then Buyer shall owe
to the Sellers (in each case, in the percentages set forth on Exhibit D to
Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter and subject to
the limitations set forth in Article X hereof) an aggregate amount equal to
the amount by which Cash exceeds Estimated Closing Cash or (ii) if Cash is
less than Estimated Closing Cash, then Buyer shall be owed the amount by which
Estimated Closing Cash exceeds Cash.

  

  

(d) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer will prepare, or cause to
be prepared (on the same basis as the preparation of the Financial
Statements), and deliver to both of the Representatives an unaudited statement
(the "Statement"), which shall set forth the Buyer's calculation of the
Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount, Net Working Capital and Cash. At
the Buyer's request, the Representatives (i) shall reasonably cooperate and
assist, and shall cause their respective representatives to assist, the Buyer
and its representatives in the preparation of the Statement and (ii) shall
provide the Buyer and its representatives with any information reasonably
requested by them.

  

  

(e) Upon receipt from the Buyer, the Representatives shall have 30 days to
review the Statement (the "Review Period"). At the request of either of the
Representatives, as the case may be, the Buyer (i) shall reasonably cooperate
and assist, and shall cause its representatives to assist, the Representatives
and their respective representatives, as the case may be, in the review of the
Statement and (ii) shall provide the Representatives and their respective
representatives with any information reasonably requested by them. If either
of the Representatives, as the case may be, disagrees with the Buyer's
computation of Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount, such
Representative, as the case may be, shall, on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period, deliver a written notice to the Buyer (the "Notice of
Objection"), which sets forth the specific objections to the Buyer's
calculation of Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount. Any Notice of
Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which such Representative
disagrees, together with a written explanation in reasonable detail of the
reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth
such Representative's calculation of Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing
Amount based on such objections. To the extent not set forth in a Notice of
Objection delivered during the Review Period, the Sellers and the
Representatives shall be deemed to have agreed with the Buyer's calculation of
the Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount and no party may thereafter
dispute any item or amount not set forth in the Notice of Objection.

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Unless the Representatives deliver the Notice of Objection to the Buyer
within the Review Period, the Representatives and the Sellers shall be deemed
to have accepted the Buyer's calculation of Adjusted Net Working Capital
Closing Amount set forth in the Statement, which shall become final,
conclusive and binding. If a Representative delivers the Notice of Objection
to the Buyer within the Review Period, the Buyer, and the Representatives
shall, during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed
extension thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount
of Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount. If, at the end of such period
or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Buyer and the Representatives
are unable to resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer
their disagreements to the Dallas, Texas office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, or,
in the event that such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity,
such other regionally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Buyer and both of the Representatives (the "Independent
Expert"). The parties shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to review
this Section 2.5 and to determine solely with respect to the disputed items
and amounts so submitted whether and to what extent, if any, the Adjusted Net
Working Capital Closing Amount set forth in the Statement requires adjustment.
The Independent Expert shall base its determination solely on written
submissions by the Buyer, and the Representatives and their respective
representatives and not on an independent review. The Buyer and the
Representatives shall make available to the Independent Expert all relevant
Books and Records of the Acquired Companies and other items reasonably
requested by the Independent Expert. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than 45 days after its retention, the Independent Expert shall
deliver to the Buyer and the Representatives a report which sets forth its
resolution of the disputed items and amounts and its calculation of Adjusted
Net Working Capital Closing Amount. The decision of the Independent Expert
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses
of the Independent Expert shall be split equally between the Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers collectively, on the other hand (who shall split the
costs in accordance with the percentages reflected on Exhibit C to Schedule
2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter). The Buyer and the
Representatives agree to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a
reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnities in favor of the
Independent Expert.

  

  

(g) Within five Business Days after the Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing
Amount has been finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5, any amounts
owed to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be paid by the Buyer to
the Sellers and any amounts owed to the Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.5
shall be paid to Buyer in accordance with Section 2.5(b)(ii) Buyer and the
Representatives shall promptly execute a joint written notice and deliver same
to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement
detailing the amount, if any, to be paid to Buyer out of the Escrow Fund
within two Business Days after the Adjusted Net Working Capital Closing Amount
has been finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5.

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.6 Withholding. Each of the Buyer, the Company, the Parent and the Escrow
Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable by it pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it
determines may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law and to request and be provided with any necessary Forms W-9
or W-8, as applicable, from the Sellers. In the event that any amount is so
deducted and withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom the payment from
which such amounts were withheld was made.

  

  

2.7 Approval/Waivers. Each Seller hereby: (i) approves this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions; (ii) waives compliance
with any provisions of the Company's LLC Agreement or the Stockholders'
Agreement of the Parent, respectively, including with respect to the sale and
transfer of Units and/or the sale and transfer of the Equity Securities of the
Parent, with respect to the Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) terminates
the Stockholders' Agreement of the Parent, effective as of the Closing.

  

  

2.8 Allocation of Consideration; Section 743 Adjustment. The purchase price
paid by the Buyer as finally determined for federal income tax purposes
pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated among the Equity Securities of
the Parent and the Units owned by the Madison Group Sellers for Tax purposes
in accordance with Schedule 2.8 of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter
(such amount allocable to the Units owned by the Madison Group Sellers being
referred to herein, as the "Units Consideration"). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Schedule 2.8 of the Acquired Companies
Disclosure Letter cannot be changed without the written consent of the Buyer
and both of the Representatives except to reflect purchases, sales, or other
dispositions of assets. Schedule 2.8 of the Acquired Companies Disclosure
Letter also sets forth the methodology for allocation of the Units
Consideration (plus other capitalized costs and the Buyer's share of the
Company's liabilities under Section 752 of the Code) among the Company's
assets. Within 90 days after the Adjusted Net Working Capital has become final
and binding pursuant to Section 2.5, the Buyer shall prepare and provide to
the Representatives a schedule allocating the Units Consideration (plus other
capitalized costs and the Buyer's share of the Company's liabilities under
Section 752 of the Code) among the Company's assets (the "Allocation
Schedule"), which Allocation Schedule shall be subject to the consent of the
Representatives (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Within 15 days of receipt of the Allocation Schedule, the
Representatives will propose to the Buyer any changes to such Allocation
Schedule (in the event no such changes are proposed in writing to the Buyer,
the Representatives shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the
Allocation Schedule). The Buyer and the Representatives will endeavor in good
faith to resolve any differences with respect to the Allocation Schedule
within 15 days after the Buyer's receipt of written notice of objection from
the Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Representatives and
the Buyer are unable to resolve any differences with respect to items on the
Allocation Schedule, then any such remaining disputed matters will be finally
and conclusively determined by the Independent Expert. The costs and expenses
of the Independent Expert shall be split equally between the Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers collectively, on the other hand (who shall split the
costs among the Sellers on Exhibit A to Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter and the Sellers on Exhibit B to Schedule 2.2(a)(i)
of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter based on their Pro Rata Share).
The Independent Expert shall determine (based solely on presentations by the
Representatives and the Buyer) only those matters in dispute and will render a
written report as to the disputed matters and the resulting allocation of the
Adjusted Gross Purchase Price (including other items), which report shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, (i) each of the Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall cause each
of its Affiliates to, report, act and file all Tax Returns in all respects and
for all purposes consistent with the Allocation Schedule, including for
purposes of (A) Treasury Regulations Section 1.743-1(d)(2) in determining
Buyer's adjustment to the U.S. federal income tax basis of the Company's
assets and (B) Treasury Regulations Section 1.751-1 in determining the
character of each Madison Group Sellers gain or loss, as the case may be, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (ii) each of the Sellers and Buyer will not, and will
not permit of any of its Affiliates to, take any position for Tax purposes
(whether on any Tax Return, in any Tax proceeding, or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule.

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.9 Payment of Transaction Bonuses. The Company shall pay to the applicable
recipients their portion of the Transaction Bonuses, less applicable
withholding taxes, as part of the Company's next regularly scheduled pay day
after the Closing Date, but, if Closing occurs before December 31, 2013, no
later than December 31, 2013.

Property; and (iii) has taken all other actions with any Governmental Entity
required to maintain its validity and effectiveness. All Registered
Intellectual Property is valid, enforceable and subsisting. None of the
Madison Group Sellers, Champlain, Ardia, B28 or 2 Under nor any Acquired
Company has taken any action or failed to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture,
relinquishment, invalidation, waiver or unenforceability of any Registered
Intellectual Property.

  

  

(c) Schedule 5.9(c) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter identifies all
Licensed Intellectual Property and the relevant license (except for the
Licensed Intellectual Property that is the subject of off-the-shelf or similar
commercially available end-user licenses, each of which has incurred license
fees of less than $400,000 per year with respect to each separate license).

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Schedule 5.9(d) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter lists all
licenses, sublicenses, and other agreements pursuant to which any Acquired
Company authorizes a third party to use, practice any rights under, co-exist
with, or grant sublicenses with respect to any Company Intellectual Property
(including on such list, whether such license is exclusive or non-exclusive).

  

  

(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9(e) of the Acquired Companies
Disclosure Letter, the Company Intellectual Property constitutes all of the
Intellectual Property that is used in and material to the operation of the
Acquired Companies' businesses as they are currently conducted. The Acquired
Companies own or have the right to use pursuant to a valid Contract all
Intellectual Property necessary for the normal operation of the businesses of
the Acquired Companies as currently conducted. Each item of Company
Intellectual Property used by each Acquired Company immediately prior to the
Closing will be available for use by such Acquired Company on identical terms
and conditions immediately subsequent to the Closing.

  

  

(f) No aspect of the Owned Intellectual Property or the operation of the
Acquired Companies' businesses as currently conducted infringes,
misappropriates, dilutes or otherwise violates the Intellectual Property or
other rights or assets of any Person.

  

  

(g) To the Knowledge of the Acquired Companies, no Person has infringed,
misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, or is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating, any Owned Intellectual
Property. No Action has been instituted relating to any Owned Intellectual
Property, or, to the Knowledge of the Acquired Companies, threatened relating
to any Company Intellectual Property. None of the Acquired Companies has
received any opinion of counsel regarding any Patents of any other Person.

  

  

(h) None of the Owned Intellectual Property, or Licensed Intellectual Property
that is exclusively licensed to any Acquired Company, is subject to any
outstanding Order.

  

  

(i) None of the Acquired Companies are required to pay any royalties for the
use of any Company Intellectual Property or the making or selling of products
or services other than Licensed Intellectual Property.

  

  

(j) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9(j) of the Acquired Companies
Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of the Acquired Companies none of the
Acquired Companies has ever agreed to indemnify any Person for or against any
interference, infringement, misappropriation, or other conflict with respect
to Company Intellectual Property.

  

  

(k) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9(k) of the Acquired Companies
Disclosure Letter, (i) each Acquired Company has taken reasonable steps in the
development of any Intellectual Property of an Acquired Company to protect the
ownership of such Intellectual Property and the confidentiality of the Know-
How of the Acquired Companies, and (ii) none of the Madison Group Sellers,
Champlain, Ardia, B28 or 2 Under will, after giving effect to the Contemplated
Transactions, own or retain any rights to use any of the Company Intellectual
Property except for the benefit of Buyer.

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(l) Each Acquired Company has taken reasonable steps to protect and maintain
the proprietary nature of each item of Owned Intellectual Property and the
confidentiality of the Know-How of the Acquired Companies. All current and
former employees of the Acquired Companies who have made contributions to the
development of the Owned Intellectual Property used in the business of the
Acquired Companies as presently conducted or who have had access in any
material respect to the Acquired Companies' confidential and proprietary
information with respect to the Owned Intellectual Property used in the
business of the Acquired Companies as presently conducted, have entered into
enforceable contractual obligations with the Acquired Companies whereby (a)
the Acquired Companies are entitled to all ownership rights (except to the
extent prevented by applicable Law related to employees' rights in and to the
inventions made by him/her in the course of their employment) in any
Intellectual Property relating to the business of the Acquired Companies as
presently conducted, that the employee may have invented, discovered,
originated, made, or conceived in the course of his or her employment by the
Acquired Companies, and all such ownership rights are duly assigned to the
Acquired Companies, and (b) the employee has agreed, subject to applicable
Law, to hold and maintain in confidence all such confidential and proprietary
information of the Acquired Companies. No agents or consultants of the
Acquired Companies have entered into similar contractual obligations. The
Acquired Companies' general practice has been to require all employees who
contribute to the development of Owned Intellectual Property, or who have had
access to confidential and proprietary information of the Acquired Companies
to enter into confidentiality agreements with one of the Acquired Companies.
No agents or consultants of the Acquired Companies have entered into
confidentiality agreements with any of the Acquired Companies. No agents or
consultants have any claims to ownership of the Owned Intellectual Property.

  

  

(m) No funding, facilities, or personnel of any Governmental Entity or
educational institution, were used, directly or indirectly, to develop or
create, in whole or in part, any of the Owned Intellectual Property, or, to
the Knowledge of the Acquired Companies, any Licensed Intellectual Property
exclusively licensed to any Acquired Company.

  

  

5.10 Software and Information Systems.

  

  

(a) The Software and other information technology used to operate the
businesses of the Acquired Companies as they are currently conducted (i) are
in satisfactory working order and are scalable to meet current and reasonably
anticipated capacity; (ii) have reasonably appropriate security, back-ups,
disaster recovery arrangements, and hardware and software support and
maintenance to minimize the risk of material error, breakdown, failure, or
security breach occurring; (iii) are configured and maintained in accordance

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Acquired Companies are in possession of and the Buyer will receive
such working copies of all Software, including, object and (for Software owned
by or exclusively licensed to any Acquired Company) source code, and all
related manuals, licenses, and other documentation, as are necessary for the
current conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies.

  

  

(c) Schedule 5.10(c) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter identifies:
(i) any Contracts pursuant to which any Acquired Company licensed, or
otherwise provided, to any Person any source code of Software that constitutes
Licensed Intellectual Property or Owned Intellectual Property that is licensed
to third parties; and (ii) any escrow arrangements regarding the source code
of Software that constitutes Licensed Intellectual Property or Owned
Intellectual Property that is licensed to third parties. Except pursuant to
the Contracts and arrangements identified in Schedule 5.10(c) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) could
reasonably be expected to result in the delivery, license, or disclosure of
any source code for any Company Proprietary Software to any other Person.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.10(d) of the Acquired Companies
Disclosure Letter, all Open Source Software used by any Acquired Company is
fully segregable and independent from any Software that is proprietary to any
Acquired Company, and no Open Source Software is or has been incorporated or
otherwise integrated into, aggregated, compiled or distributed, in whole or in
part, with any proprietary Software of any Acquired Company. Schedule 5.10(d)
of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter accurately identifies all Open
Source Software used by the Acquired Companies and accurately identifies the
license under which the Open Source Software is made available.

(g) Except as described on Schedule 5.5(g) of the Acquired Companies
Disclosure Letter, there is no contract, agreement, plan, or arrangement
covering any Person that, individually or in the aggregate, as a consequence
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
or otherwise (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as
termination of employment) could give rise to the payment of any amount that
would be either subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or not
be deductible by the Parent or any of the Acquired Companies, as the case may
be, by reason of Section 280G of the Code. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements,
either alone or in conjunction with another event (such as a termination of
employment), will not (i) entitle any current or former employee of the Parent
or any of the Acquired Companies to severance pay, or any other payment under

Companies will not be obligated to provide, or cause to be provided, such
access or information to the extent that the Acquired Companies determine, in
their reasonable judgment, that doing so would (a) violate any requirements of

Section 5.13 if such Action had arisen prior to the date hereof and (ii) any
other event or matter which becomes known to the Parent, the Company, the
other Acquired Companies, or either of the Representatives and would cause any

any representation or warranty untrue and shall revise the applicable
disclosure letter accordingly. The Company shall include in such notice copies
of all documents, materials and other information known to the Acquired

7.5 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, the Sellers and the
Representatives shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, hold,
and shall use their best efforts (commercially reasonable efforts with respect
to the Parent Shareholders other than Champlain, Ardia, B28 and 2 Under) to
cause their and their Affiliates' respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors, agents and other
representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether
written or oral, concerning the Parent or the Acquired Companies, including
the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), except
to the extent that such Person can show that such information (a) is in the
public domain through no fault of any Seller, the Representatives or any of
their respective Affiliates, (b) is lawfully acquired by them after the
Closing from sources that, to the knowledge of such Person after reasonable
inquiry, are not prohibited from disclosing such information, (c) is
reasonably relevant for enforcing the Sellers' rights or defending against
assertions by Buyer and is disclosed to any Governmental Entity or an
arbitrator or other party (e.g., opposing counsel, expert witnesses,
investigators) in connection with any legal proceedings involving (i) a
dispute between Buyer and any Seller, either of the Representatives, or the
Company or (ii) the interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination
of the Agreement, (d) that such information is disclosed by the undersigned
with the written consent of the Buyer, (e) solely with respect to Sellers who
remain employees at the Acquired Companies after the Closing, the disclosure
is necessary to continue to conduct the business of the Acquired Companies in
the ordinary course, or (f) to the extent required by any applicable Law,
Governmental Entity or legal process (subject to the requirements set forth
below). Nothing herein shall restrict disclosure by Madison or any other
Sellers that are investment or private equity firms or Affiliates of
investment or private equity firms to their respective investors of the
content of any issued press release or filed public filing by the Buyer and of
the portion of the purchase price that will be allocated, directly or
indirectly, to each such investor on a confidential basis. If any Seller or
either of the Representatives or any of their Affiliates are compelled to
disclose any such information by judicial or administrative process or by
other requirements of Law, such Person shall promptly notify the Buyer in
writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information which such
Person is advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to be
disclosed, provided that such Person shall exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts, at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information. Without prejudice to the rights
and remedies otherwise available in this Agreement, the parties each
acknowledge and agree that the covenants and undertakings contained in this
Section 7.5 relate to matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary
character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section 7.5 will cause
irreparable injury to Buyer and that money damages would not be an adequate
remedy for any breach of this Section 7.5 because damages would be impossible
to estimate or determine and could not adequately compensate Buyer, and that
the Buyer will be entitled to specific performance, temporary and permanent
injunction, restraining order and other equitable relief in respect of a
breach or threatened breach of any of this Section 7.5, without the necessity
of proving actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever, in addition to any
claims for money damages. To the extent there is any conflict between this
Section 7.5 and the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of this Section
7.5 shall apply.

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.6 Public Announcements. No party shall (and the Representatives shall cause
Parent and the Acquired Companies not to) issue any press release or make any
public statement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the
prior written approval of, the Buyer and the Representatives provided that any
party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required to
do so by applicable Law or pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or stock market (in which case the party required to make
the disclosure shall consult with the other parties to the extent possible and
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment thereon prior to issuance
or release it being understood that this Agreement will be publicly filed and
disclosed by Buyer shortly after signing). Nothing herein shall restrict
disclosure by Sellers that are investment or private equity firms or
Affiliates of investment or private equity firms to their respective investors
of the content of any issued press release or filed public filing by the Buyer
and of the portion of the purchase price that will be allocated, directly or
indirectly, to each such investor on a confidential basis. For the avoidance
of doubt, the distribution of notices and/or other information to the Sellers
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are not
in violation of any applicable Law or this Agreement shall not violate the
terms of this Section 7.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Sellers agree and consent to the filing by the Buyer with the
Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the Closing of one or more Forms
8-K announcing the signing of this Agreement and summarizing the transactions
contemplated hereby and filing this Agreement and certain financial statements
for the Acquired Companies and the Parent and related pro forma financial
information as exhibits to those Forms 8-K; it being understood that no Seller
shall have any legal or other responsibility for the form or content of any
such Forms 8-K except to the extent of Losses arising from or related to a
breach of a representation or warranty in this Agreement by a Seller, Parent
or any Acquired Company.

  

  

7.7 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Nothing contained in this Section 7.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall confer upon any employee of the Parent or any of the
Acquired Companies or any legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any
rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement or otherwise, including any right to employment or continued
employment after the Closing for any specified period, or level of
compensation or benefits. Nothing contained in this Section 7.7 or elsewhere
in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) limit the right of the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment or services of, or to

of the Acquired Companies or contractor or consultant of the Parent or any of
the Acquired Companies after the Closing, (ii) limit the ability of the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to terminate, amend or modify any Benefit Plan or any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that the Buyer
or its Affiliates may establish or maintain after the Closing or (iii) be
construed as amending or modifying any Benefit Plan as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing.

  

  

(b) The parties agree that the Transaction Bonuses shall be paid on the next
regular pay date after the Closing by the Company. The remainder of the
bonuses accrued in the ordinary course and set forth in Schedule 7.7(b) of the
Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter will be fully accrued through the Closing
Date or, if earlier, December 12, 2013, in such amounts for each employee as,
determined by the Representatives by the Closing Date and will be paid no
later than December 12, 2013; provided, however, that after the date of this
Agreement no additional bonuses will be allocated to the management employees
on Schedule 7.7(b) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter. The accrued
portion of any bonus is not subject to cancellation by the Buyer. The parties
agree that all such amounts will reduce "Current Assets" if paid prior to
Closing because the cash at Closing will reflect the payment (but Current
Assets shall not be reduced twice by such amount) and shall be counted as
"Current Liabilities" if not paid as of Closing.

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) At or prior to Closing, Sellers shall cause the Equity Incentive Plan to
be terminated such that none of Parent, any Acquired Company or Buyer shall
have ongoing liability or obligations arising thereunder. Other than the EIP
Payments, no employee of the Parent or any Acquired Company or any other
Person shall have any rights (to any payments or other compensation or
otherwise) under the Equity Incentive Plan after Closing.

the Company's U.S. federal income Tax Return (Form 1065), prepare the Schedule
K-1s relating to the Company's U.S. federal income Tax Return (Form 1065) (and

Buyer's chosen timely filing date (including extensions) for such Tax Returns;
and (3) reasonably consider in good faith any and all comments provided by the
Representatives to the Buyer with respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent
required by applicable Law and subject to the rights (set forth above) of the
Representatives to review and comment on the related relevant Tax Returns, the
Madison Group Sellers and Parent shall include income, gain, loss, deduction
or other tax items attributable to the operations of the Company that arises
from any Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Pre-Closing Income") on their respective Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with their allocable share of Pre-Closing

documents attributable to their pre-Closing ownership of the Company (and
indirect ownership of the Subsidiaries of the Company) (with respect to each
Madison Group Seller and Parent, its "Allocable Share") and as shall be
furnished to the Madison Group Sellers and Parent by the Buyer or Company for
such periods; provided, that with respect to Parent's Allocable Share of Pre-

Share of Pre-Closing Income.

(B) Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (or after the Closing,

refile or otherwise modify any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies or the
Parent that cover a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (2) make any Tax election with
respect to any of the Acquired Companies or the Parent that has a retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without the prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, delayed or
denied) of both of the Representatives.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the case of any Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding concerning the Parent or any of the Acquired Companies
which the Representatives have agreed in writing to fully indemnify under
Article X and no material adverse consequences are possible with respect to
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, after
the Closing, includes the Parent and the Acquired Companies), the
Representatives shall jointly control the preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, disposition and/or conduct of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding at
the sole expense of the Sellers; provided, however, that (A) the
Representatives shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the progress
and substantive aspects of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding, and (B) the
Representatives will not settle or consent to the entry of any order or other
similar determination or finding with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall control the
preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement, disposition and or conduct of
any Straddle Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that, with respect to any Tax
items in a Straddle Tax Proceeding which the Representatives would be required
to provide indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, (Y) the Representatives
and Buyer shall jointly control in good faith the preparation, prosecution,
defense and/or conduct of any such Tax items in such Straddle Tax Proceeding,
and (Z) neither the Representatives nor the Buyer shall settle with respect to
any such Tax items in such Straddle Tax Proceeding without the consent of the
other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
delayed or denied by either Party. In all other cases, the Buyer shall control
the preparation, prosecution, defense, settlement, disposition and/or conduct
of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding" shall mean any audit, examination, claim for refund,
Action, or other administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted
Tax liability or refund with respect to the Parent or any of the Acquired
Companies for any Taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and a
"Straddle Tax Proceeding" shall mean any audit, examination, claim for refund,
Action, or other administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted
Tax liability or refund with respect to the Parent or any of the Acquired
Companies for any Straddle Period.

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Tax Cooperation. The Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall each cause its
Affiliates to, provide to the other party such cooperation, information and
assistance (including the execution of any powers of attorney), as and to the
extent reasonably requested, in connection with preparing, reviewing, signing
and filing of any Tax Return of or with respect to the Acquired Companies or
the Parent or in conducting any audit or other Action, including any Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding, with respect to Taxes of or attributable to the
Acquired Companies or the Parent. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns,
together with relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers,
relevant documents relating to rulings and other determinations by Taxing
Authorities, and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of
property, which any such party may possess. Each of the Buyer and the Sellers
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, retain all Tax Returns,
schedules, work papers, and all material records and other documents relating
to Tax matters of the Acquired Companies and Parent in its possession with
respect to Taxable periods beginning on or before the Closing Date until the
later of either (i) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notice is provided with respect thereto, any extensions
thereof) for the Taxable periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate, or (ii) any record retention agreement entered into with any Taxing
Authority. Buyer and Sellers agree, upon request, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Allocation of Certain Taxes.

  

  

(i) To the extent permitted by applicable U.S. federal or state Tax Law,
income and expenses of the Acquired Companies accrued on the Closing Date
shall be allocated for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes to the
Taxable period of the Acquired Companies that ends on the Closing Date, in the
case of the Parent consistent with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(vi) and proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.706-1(c)(2)(iii). If the Parent or an Acquired Company is permitted or
required under applicable U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax
Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Taxable period, then the
Parent or an Acquired Company, as applicable, shall cause the Closing Date to
be treated as the last day of a Taxable period, shall elect the closing of the
books method and use the equivalent of the calendar day convention, as
provided in proposed Treasury Regulations under Code Section 706 (as of the
Closing Date with respect to the Company) in accordance with Treas. Reg. §
1.706-1 (c)(2)(ii) (and any corresponding provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law), and shall elect to close the books of the Parent as of the
Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of Taxes attributable to such
Straddle Period that are allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such
Straddle Period shall be determined as follows: (1) in the case of any real
property, personal property, ad valorem and similar Taxes ("Property Taxes"),
the amount of such Property Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
of such Straddle Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Property Tax
for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period, and (2) in
the case of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, capital or
revenues or any other Taxes except for Property Taxes, the amount any such Tax
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, (A) deductions in
employment and payroll related Taxes, including, the withholding of all income
Taxes, FICA and FUTA, and (B) the Taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which any Acquired Company or the Parent holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect
to any Acquired Company or the Parent shall be allocated to the Taxable period
during which the gross receipts, income, operations, assets, margin or capital
comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right
to do business for another period is obtained by the payment of such franchise
Tax, and if the Tax period to which such franchise Tax is so allocated is a
Straddle Period, then such franchise Tax allocated to a Straddle Period shall
be determined in the manner set forth in (2) above.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

(iii) Except as otherwise required by Law, all U.S. federal income Tax
deductions (and state, local or non-U.S. income tax deductions where
applicable) arising from any payments made at or as of Closing as a result of
the Contemplated Transactions, including, without limitation, any Sellers'
Transaction Expenses, any Transaction Bonuses, and the bonuses described in
Section 7.7(b), to the extent accrued, shall be reflected on the U.S. federal
income Tax Returns (and state, local or non-U.S. income Tax Returns where
applicable) of the Parent consistent with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(vi) and proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.706-1(c)(2)(iii) or the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, for the Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, and, for avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not nor shall it
cause any of its Affiliates to treat such deductions (or a portion thereof) as
occurring after the Closing Date under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b) (or any similar provision of state, local or non-US applicable
Law).

  

  

(d) Payment of Transfer Taxes and Fees. Any Transfer Taxes shall be shared
equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other, except
that any Transfer Taxes that are attributable to the issuance of any shares of
Buyer's Stock as part of the Adjusted Gross Purchase Price shall be paid
solely by Buyer. The Representatives shall file all necessary documentation
and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes, the cost of which shall
be borne equally by the parties in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. The Buyer shall provide such reasonable cooperation in connection
with the preparation and filing of such documentation and Tax Returns as may
be reasonably requested by the Representatives. Any Transfer Taxes or fees
related to the issuance of Buyer's Stock shall be paid by Buyer.

  

  

(e) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Except for the tax sharing
arrangement among B27 Resources, Inc. and all of the other Acquired Companies,
all Tax sharing agreements, Tax indemnity agreement or similar agreements or
arrangements in respect of Taxes involving Parent or an Acquired Company shall
be terminated with respect to Parent and the Acquired Companies as of the day
before the Closing Date and, on and after the Closing Date, neither Parent nor
any of the Acquired Companies shall be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Refunds. The amount of any refund of any Taxes (including any interest
thereon) of any Acquired Company or the Parent attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period after December 31, 2012 that is received by Buyer, its Affiliates,
the Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing shall be:
(i) in the case of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for the benefit and
account of the Sellers, and (ii) in the case of the Parent, for the benefit
and account of the Parent Shareholders, except, in any case, to the extent
that any such refund (y) is included as a Current Asset and taken into account
in the final and binding Adjusted Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.5,
or (z) results from the carryback of any net operating loss, credit or other
Tax attribute from any Taxable period (or portion of a Taxable Period)
beginning after the Closing Date. Any such Tax refund shall be paid by Buyer
to the Representatives, as applicable, each in the amount of their Pro Rata
Share, within five days after any such refund is received. For the avoidance
of doubt: to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any net operating loss
(including a net operating loss attributable to or arising from payments made
under the Equity Incentive Plan and/or Transaction Bonuses), credit or other
similar Tax attribute of Parent or any Acquired Company attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the Company shall first be carried back to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period of Parent or any Acquired Company, and to the extent such net
operating loss, credit or other similar Tax attribute is carried back to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of Parent or any Acquired Company and produces a Tax
refund for Parent or any Acquired Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that is for the account of the Parent Shareholders or the Madison Group
Sellers, as applicable, in accordance with the first sentence of this Section
7.8(f), such Tax refund obtained shall be for the account of the Parent
Shareholders or the Madison Group Sellers, as applicable, and the related Tax
refund obtained shall be paid to the Parent Shareholders' Representative (for
the benefit and account of the Parent Shareholders) or the Madison Group
Sellers' Representative (for the benefit and account of the Madison Group
Sellers), as applicable, within ten Business Days after such refund is
received; and the related Tax refund obtained shall be treated as an
adjustment to the consideration payable to the Parent Shareholders or the
Madison Group Sellers, as applicable. Also, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall have no obligation to reimburse or otherwise make any payment under this
Section 7.8(f) (or any other provision of this Agreement) to the Sellers, the
Representatives, or any other Person as a result of the availability or
utilization in a Taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date of any net operating loss, credit, or other Tax attribute of
Parent or any Acquired Company that is attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the previous sentence shall not be
interpreted to mean that the net operating loss of Parent referred to in the
previous sentence cannot be used as an offset for the accrued Tax liability
arising from the change in the method of accounting as reflected in the
calculation of Net Working Capital on Exhibit A.

  

  

(g) Section 754 Election. If the Company does not have in effect an election
under Section 754 of the Code (and any equivalent election for applicable
state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes) relating to the adjustment of
the tax bases of the Company's assets as provided in Sections 734 and 743 of
the Code (or any similar provision under state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law) (a
"Section 754 Election") that would be applicable on the sale of the Units
pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall make a Section 754 Election on
its U.S. federal income Tax Return (and state, local or non-U.S. income Tax
Returns where applicable) for the Taxable year of the Company that includes
the Closing Date.

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Consolidated Group. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Buyer
shall include or cause to be included the Parent and any of its eligible
Subsidiaries in the federal consolidated group of which the Buyer is a member
and any analogous state consolidated, combined or unitary group (if
applicable) during the period immediately following the Closing Date.

  

  

(i) Notice of § 409A Correction Amendment to 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. The
Buyer shall attach a notice of "§ 409A Document Correction Under Sections V.B
and VII.C of Notice 2010-6" to its 2013 federal Tax Returns in the form
attached to Schedule 7.8(i) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter
notifying the IRS of the adoption in 2013 of an amendment to the 2008 Equity
Incentive Plan to correct Code Section 409A document errors. Buyer shall also
notify the affected participants in the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan of the
corrective amendment, provide each such participant with an individualized
notice of correction in the form attached hereto as Schedule 7.8(i) of the
Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter and instruct each such participant to
attach such individualized notice of correction to his 2013 federal Tax
Returns in accordance with the applicable requirements of Notice 2010-6.

  

  

7.9 Access to Books and Records. The Buyer will, and will cause the Acquired
Companies to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
respective businesses of the Acquired Companies, for a period of seven years
from the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law) and will make
such records and personnel reasonably available to the Representatives as may
be required by such party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, Action or tax audits against or governmental
investigations of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates; provided
such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the
applicable Acquired Companies.

  

  

7.10 Further Assurances. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Buyer and
the Sellers shall (and (i) the Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies to
and (ii) Parent Shareholders shall cause Parent to) use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions. If
at any time (whether before or after the Closing) any further action is
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, that action.

  

  

7.11 Directors' and Officers' Insurance Policy.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent and/or one or more of the Acquired Companies
may obtain a six year prepaid "tail policy" on reasonable terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Parent and/or
the Acquired Companies on the date of this Agreement with respect to claims
arising in whole or in part from factors or events that actually or allegedly
occurred on or before the Closing Date. The Parties agree that the costs of
such "tail policy" shall be treated as a Transaction Expense of Sellers.

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing, the Organizational Documents
of the Parent and the Acquired Companies shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the current or former directors or officers of the Parent and
the Acquired Companies for periods prior to and including the Closing than are
currently set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Parent and the
Acquired Companies.

action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Parent Shareholders'
Representative that is within the scope of the Parent Shareholders'

7.13 Restrictive Covenants.

  

  

(a) Each of Champlain, Ardia, Michael W. Madison, Kevin Jay Randle, and
William H. Marsh (each a "Restricted Person") covenant that, commencing on the
Closing Date and ending, in the cases of Champlain, Ardia and Dennis H. Leary,
on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, and in the cases of Michael W.
Madison, Kevin Jay Randle and William H. Marsh on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date (in each case, the "Restricted Period"), such Sellers shall not,
and they shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, own, manage, engage in, operate, join, control, be employed by or
work for or consult with or render services for, do business with, maintain
any interest in (proprietorship, financial or otherwise), or participate in
the ownership, management or control of, or be connected in any manner with
(except for ownership of fewer than 1% of the common stock or equity interest
of a public corporation or ownership resulting from a distribution to
Champlain from one of its portfolio companies), any business engaged in: (i)
the designing, remanufacturing, manufacturing, distributing, servicing or
repairing of pumps built to American Petroleum Institute or American National
Standards Institute standards for the oil and gas and power markets, (ii)
integrated flow control solutions for the Oil and Gas Industry, Air Quality
Industry, or Power Generation Industries, and (iii) Engineered-to-Order

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Restricted Business" shall not include the
Restricted Person's equity ownership of any of B47, LLC, Fred Jones
Investments, LLC, Intelliquip, LLC, Reynolds RE, LLC, Momentum Engineered
Systems, Inc., or B27 RE, Inc., in each case so long as such entity does not
change its business from what it has been in the twelve months prior to the
date of this Agreement to include any activities that would come within the
definition of the Restricted Business.

  

 

 

 

  

 

89  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each Restricted Person agrees that during the Restricted Period, he or it
shall not, directly or indirectly (and shall cause his or its respective
Affiliates not to), (i) cause, induce, encourage or solicit the employment or
engagement of services of any Person who is an employee, contractor or
consultant of Parent or any Acquired Company, the Buyer or its Affiliates,
hire any such Person, or persuade, induce or attempt to persuade or induce any
such Person to leave his, her or its employment or to refrain from providing
services to Parent or any Acquired Company, the Buyer or its Affiliates or
(ii) solicit, cause, encourage or induce, or in any manner attempt to solicit,
cause, encourage or induce, or cause or authorize any other Person to solicit

Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates) to cease, terminate, modify,
diminish or not commence doing business with Parent, any Acquired Company, the

individual or influence such hiring decision in any way.

  

  

(c) Each Restricted Person acknowledges that the restrictions contained in
this Section 7.13 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of the Buyer and constitute a material inducement to the Buyer to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Restricted Person acknowledges that any violation of this
Section 7.13 will result in irreparable injury to the Buyer and agree that in
addition to all other damages to which Buyer may be entitled the Buyer shall
be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without the
necessity of proving actual damages, as well as an equitable accounting of all
earnings, profits and other benefits arising from any violation of this
Section 7.13, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other
rights or remedies to which the Buyer may be entitled.

  

  

(d) In the event that any covenant contained in this Section 7.13 should ever

regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"). Buyer's Stock
Recipients have each reviewed Buyer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2012 and any Form 10-Qs or Form 8-Ks filed subsequent to
December 31, 2012 and prior to the date of this Agreement and the proxy
statement relating to Buyer's 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. Buyer's
Stock Recipients are each familiar with the business and financial condition,
properties, operations and prospects of Buyer and has had the opportunity to
discuss Buyer's business and financial condition, properties, operations and
prospects with Buyer's management and to ask questions of officers of Buyer,
which questions, if any, were answered to their satisfaction.

  

  

(b) Buyer's Stock Recipients each understands that (i) Buyer's Stock will be
"restricted securities" under the applicable federal securities laws, (ii)
that the Securities Act provides in substance that such shareholder may
dispose of Buyer's Stock only pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act or in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, (iii) that Buyer has no obligation or
intention to register the sale of Buyer's Stock pursuant to the Securities
Act, and that, accordingly, each Buyer's Stock Recipient may be required to
bear the economic risk of the investment in Buyer's Stock for a period of
time, and (iv) Buyer's Stock shall be subject to appropriate stop-transfer
instructions to be given by Buyer to its transfer agents and shall have
endorsed thereon a legend substantially as follows:

  

  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE OR ELECTRONIC ENTRY HAVE NOT
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE LAW AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT REGISTRATION
UNDER THE ACT OR SUCH APPLICABLE STATE LAW UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH
REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE THEREUNDER UNLESS THE BUYER HAS BEEN FURNISHED WITH
AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, WHICH OPINION AND COUNSEL SHALL BE REASONABLY
SATISFACTORY TO THE BUYER, THAT REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT IS NOT REQUIRED.

  

  

(c) None of the Buyer's Stock Recipients, or any of their respective
affiliates, are parties to any agreement or plan that provides for a pro rata
or similar distribution of any of Buyer's Stock.

  

 

 

 

  

 

94  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not part of any pre-
existing plan or agreement to provide for the distribution of any of Buyer's
Stock.

  

  

(e) Each Buyer's Stock Recipient will not transfer, sell or otherwise
distribute Buyer's Stock prior to six months from the date hereof, unless it
shall have delivered to the Buyer an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
and from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, that such transfer,
sale or distribution is not a sale under Rule 145 promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act.

  

  

(f) Whenever the restrictions imposed by this Section 7.21 shall terminate, as
herein provided, the holder of Buyer's Stock as to which such restrictions
have terminated shall be entitled to receive from Buyer, without expense to
each Buyer's Stock Recipient, a new certificate not bearing the restrictive
legend set forth in this Section 7.21 and not containing any other reference
to the restrictions imposed by this Section 7.21.

  

  

7.22 Data Room. Within 10 Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the
Representatives shall cause Houlihan Lokey to deliver to Buyer and Buyer's
counsel a disk or flash drive containing the Data Room as it existed at the
time of the execution of this Agreement. Within 10 Business Days after the
Closing, the Representatives shall cause Houlihan Lokey to deliver to Buyer
and Buyer's counsel a disk or flash drive containing the Data Room as it
existed as of the time of Closing.

Share thereof, (iv) any breach of or failure by such Seller, either
Representative, Parent or any Acquired Company to perform any covenant or
obligation or other agreement contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement, or any certificate or other document furnished or to be furnished
to the Buyer in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; provided, that
in the case of any breach or failure by either Representative, the Parent or
any Acquired Company, solely to the extent of such Seller's Pro Rata Share
thereof, (v) such Seller\'s Pro Rata Share of any matter set forth on Schedule
10.2(a)(v) of the Acquired Companies Disclosure Letter, which, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, cannot be changed after the date
of this Agreement, (vi) such Seller\'s Pro Rata Share of the Sellers\'
Transaction Expenses not paid at Closing or included in Current Liabilities,
(vii) such Seller\'s Pro Rata Share of any Claims by any Seller against the
Buyer Indemnitees relating to the allocation of the Adjusted Gross Purchase
Price among the Sellers as set forth in Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Acquired
Companies Disclosure Letter and Exhibits A through F thereto, (viii) such
Seller\'s Pro Rata Share of any Claims related to the Transaction Bonuses,
(ix) its Pro Rata Share of amounts owed to Buyer pursuant to Sections 2.5(b)
or (c) in excess of the Working Capital Escrow Fund, (x) any fraud or willful
misrepresentation by or on behalf of such Seller, Parent, either
Representative, or any Acquired Company; provided, that in the case of any
fraud or willful misrepresentation by either Representative, Parent or any
Acquired Company, solely to the extent of such Seller's Pro Rata Share
thereof, (xi) subject to Section 10.8(f), its Pro Rata Share of any Losses
incurred by Buyer because a letter of credit that comprises a portion of the
Continuing Indebtedness is drawn upon or called after Closing as a result of a
failure of the Company or any other Acquired Company to perform or an omission
by the Company or any other Acquired Company to perform on or before Closing;
provided, that no Seller shall be liable for Losses by Buyer with respect to
any letter of credit that is amended or increased after Closing to the extent
such Losses are attributable to such amendment or increase (for example, if a
letter of credit is increased from $1 million to $2 million, the Sellers'
liability for that letter of credit remains at $1 million); and (xii) (A) its
Pro Rata Share of any and all Taxes of, or attributable to, the Parent or any
of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (in the case of any
Straddle Period, determined in the manner set forth in Section 7.8(c)(ii));
(B) its Pro Rata Share of any and all Taxes for which the Parent or any of the
Acquired Companies becomes liable by reason of (1) being a member of an
affiliated, combined, consolidated, unitary or aggregate group at any time
prior to the Closing, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar provision under any state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law, (2) being a successor-in-interest or transferee of any other
person as a result of an event or transaction occurring prior to Closing, or
(3) having an express or implied obligation to indemnify any other Person
under any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity agreement, or similar agreement
with respect to Taxes that was executed or in effect at any time prior to
Closing; and (C) its Pro Rata Share of fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer
Taxes; provided, however in the case of (A) and (B) of this Section
10.2(a)(xii), only if and to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount, if any,
of such Taxes included as a Current Liability (excluding any liability for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) and taken into account in the final and binding Adjusted Net Working
Capital pursuant to Section 2.5 and (xiii) any inaccuracy or breach or failure
of any representation or warranty made by such Seller, or, in the case of the
Parent, either Representative, or any Acquired Company, its Pro Rata Share
thereof, in any Ancillary Agreement.

(b) The Sellers shall not be liable for a Loss pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)
or (ii) unless (i) such individual claim for Loss, or series of related
claims, exceed $5,000 (the "De Minimis Threshold") and further, (ii) the total
claims for all Losses by the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 10.2(a)(i) or
(ii) exceeds $2,000,000 (the "Basket") in the aggregate, in which event the
Sellers shall be liable for all such Losses from the first dollar above
$2,000,000; provided that the Basket shall not apply to any Losses arising
from the inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Representation or any
representation or warranty in Section 5.22. With respect to any inaccuracy or
breach of Section 5.22, the Sellers shall not be liable for a Loss pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i) or (ii) unless (x) such individual claim for Loss, or
series of related claims, exceed the De Minimis Threshold and further, (y) the
total claims for all Losses by the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 10.2(a)(i)
or (ii) related to any inaccuracy or breach of Section 5.22 exceeds $1,000,000
in the aggregate, in which event the Sellers shall be liable for all such
Losses from the first dollar, including the first $1,000,000.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

101  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Subject to Section 10.3, the aggregate liability of the Sellers for
indemnifiable Losses under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (ii) (in either case, other
than with respect to breaches or inaccuracies under Section 5.22) shall not
exceed the Escrow Amount. Subject to Section 10.3, Buyer Indemnitees may
recover from the Sellers any indemnification with respect to claims for Losses
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) or (ii) (in either case, other than with
respect to breaches or inaccuracies under Section 5.22) only by making claims
in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement. Subject to Section 10.3, no Seller shall have any liability for
indemnifiable Losses under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (ii) (in either case, other
than with respect to breaches or inaccuracies under Section 5.22) in excess of
the Escrow Amount, which monies are to be paid into the Escrow Fund by the
Buyer at the Closing, and the Escrow Fund shall be the Buyer Indemnitees' sole
and exclusive source of recovery with respect to any amounts required to be
paid by the Sellers pursuant to Section 10.2(a) (other than with respect to
breaches or inaccuracies under Section 5.22). For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing limitations are exclusive of the right of the Buyer to recover any
sums due pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement. For purposes of Article X,
qualifications as to materiality, including the term "material" (or any
variation thereof), Material Adverse Effect or any similar language in any
representation, warranty or covenant shall not be taken into account in
determining whether a breach of such representation, warranty or covenant (or
failure of any representation, warranty or covenant to be true and correct)
exists, and shall also not be taken into account in determining the amount of
any Losses with respect to such breach or failure to be true and correct.

  

  

(d) Subject to Section 10.3, the aggregate liability of the Sellers for
indemnifiable Losses under Section 10.2(a)(i) or (ii) with respect to breaches
or inaccuracies under Section 5.22 shall not exceed the Special Escrow Amount.
Subject to Section 10.3, Buyer Indemnitees may recover from the Sellers any
indemnification with respect to claims for Losses pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(i) or (ii) with respect to breaches or inaccuracies under Section 5.22
only by making claims in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Special Escrow Agreement. Subject to Section 10.3, no Seller
shall have any liability for indemnifiable Losses under Section 10.2(a)(i) or
(ii) with respect to breaches or inaccuracies under Section 5.22 in excess of
the Special Escrow Amount, which monies are to be paid into the Special Escrow
Fund by the Buyer at the Closing, and the Special Escrow Fund shall be the
Buyer Indemnitees' sole and exclusive source of recovery with respect to any
amounts required to be paid by the Sellers pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) or
(ii) with respect to breaches or inaccuracies under Section 5.22.

10.3 Indemnification by the Sellers for Seller Fundamental Representations and
Warranties and Fraud.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) for Losses
incurred based on breaches of or inaccuracies in Seller Fundamental
Representations by the Parent or an Acquired Company, the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be required to recover, first, from each applicable Seller\'s (in such
capacity, the "Indemnifying Seller") Pro Rata Share of the balance of the
Escrow Fund at the time the claim is made under the Escrow Agreement, and
second, if and only to the extent such Losses exceed such Pro Rata Share of
the Indemnifying Seller, directly from the Indemnifying Seller(s) (subject to
Section 10.3(b)), on a several and not joint basis, in accordance with each
such Indemnifying Seller\'s Pro Rata Share, and (ii) for Losses incurred based
on breaches of or inaccuracies in Seller Fundamental Representations by an
individual Seller, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be required to recover, first,
from such Indemnifying Seller\'s Pro Rata Share of the balance of the Escrow
Fund at the time the claim is made under the Escrow Agreement, and second, if
and only to the extent such Losses exceed such Pro Rata Share of the
Indemnifying Seller, directly from the Indemnifying Seller (subject to Section
10.3(b)). For the avoidance of doubt, no Seller shall be liable for the breach
of any Seller Fundamental Representation by any other Seller in such Seller's
capacity as a Seller and not as an officer or representative of an Acquired
Company; provided, however, that a Seller may be liable as described in this
Agreement for a breach of a Fundamental Representation by an Acquired Company
or Parent. In the event that (i) the Escrow Amount is depleted or reduced by
reason of a Loss to a Buyer Indemnitee as a result of a breach under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by a Indemnifying Seller and (ii) such
depletion or reduction, together with any other depletions or reductions of
the Escrow Amount, causes the Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount to which the
other Sellers (the "Non-Breaching Sellers") would otherwise have been entitled
to be depleted or reduced, such Indemnifying Seller shall reimburse the Non-
Breaching Sellers for the amount of such Loss.

  

  

(b) Except for fraud and obligations under the Ancillary Agreements, the
cumulative indemnification obligation of each Seller under this Agreement
shall in no event exceed the portion of the Adjusted Gross Purchase Price
actually paid to such Seller (such amount for any single Seller, the
"Individual Aggregate Cap").

  

  

10.4 Rights Unaffected. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in
Sections 10.2 or 10.3 shall prevent any Seller from seeking contribution from
any other Seller responsible for any Loss suffered by the Sellers in the
aggregate pursuant to Sections 10.2 or 10.3.

  

  

10.5 Indemnification by the Buyer. The Buyer shall indemnify and defend the
Sellers and, as applicable, their respective Affiliates, representatives,
trustees, heirs, successors and assigns (the "Seller Indemnitees") against,
and shall hold them harmless from, any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or resulting from: (i) any
inaccuracy or breach or failure of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or in any certificate
or other document furnished or to be furnished to the Sellers in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions to be true and correct in all respects as
of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date; (ii) any breach by the
Buyer or failure of the Buyer to perform any covenant, obligation or other
agreement contained in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, or in
any Certificate or other documents furnished or to be furnished to the Sellers
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; (iii) any liability arising
from any Form 8-K filed by the Buyer in accordance with Section 7.6, except to
the extent such liability arises from or is related to a breach of a
representation or warranty under this Agreement by a Seller, Parent or any
Acquired Company, and (iv) any Loss related, directly or indirectly, to the
ownership or operation of Parent or any of the Acquired Companies following
the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Buyer shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to this Section 10.5 unless
(A) such individual claim for Loss, or series of related claims, exceed the De
Minimis Threshold and further, (B) and the total claims for all Losses made by
the Seller Indemnitees under Section 10.5 exceeds $2,000,000 in the aggregate
(the "Buyer Basket"), in which event the Buyer shall be liable for all such
Losses from the first dollar above $2,000,000; provided that the Buyer Basket
shall not apply to any Losses arising from the inaccuracy or breach of
Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.4 or 6.5. The aggregate liability of the Buyer for
indemnifiable Losses under Section 10.5 shall not exceed the Escrow Amount.

  

 

 

 

  

 

103  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.6 Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) In the event that an Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under the provisions of this Article X (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third
Party Claim (such notice, a "Notice of Claim"); provided that the failure or
delay in notifying the Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim will not relieve
the Indemnitor of any Liability it may have to the Indemnitee, except and only
to the extent that such failure or delay causes actual prejudice to the
Indemnitor with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(b) The Indemnitor will have 20 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Notice of Claim (the "Indemnitor Defense Review Period") to
notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom
(a "Third Party Defense"). If the Indemnitor assumes the Third Party Defense
in accordance herewith, (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the
Indemnitor unless the employment of such counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnitor, and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, but the Indemnitor shall control the defense thereof; (ii)
the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; (iii) the Indemnitor shall be conclusively deemed to have
acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is within the scope of its indemnity
obligation under this Agreement; (iv) the Indemnitor shall conduct the Third
Party Defense actively and diligently and provide reasonable updates in
connection with the Third Party Defense to the Indemnitee; and (v) the
Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation in the Third Party Defense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if counsel for the Indemnitee reasonably
determines that there is a conflict between the positions of the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee in conducting the defense of such Action or that there are
legal defenses available to such Indemnitee different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnitor, then counsel for the Indemnitee shall be
entitled, if the Indemnitee so elects, to conduct the defense to the extent
reasonably determined by such counsel to protect the interests of the
Indemnitee, at the expense of the Indemnitor.

  

 

 

 

  

 

104  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense prior to the end
of the Indemnitor Defense Review Period, the Indemnitee shall have the right
to assume the Third Party Defense at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall have the right, at its expense, to
participate in such Third Party Defense but the Indemnitee shall control the
investigation, defense and settlement thereof. The Indemnitee shall conduct
the Third Party Defense actively and diligently, and the Indemnitor will
provide reasonable cooperation in the Third Party Defense. The Indemnitee
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner without the consent of the
Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

  

  

(d) The Indemnitor will not be entitled to assume the Third Party Defense if:

  

  

(i) the Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary
damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief;

  

  

(ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Action, indictment or allegation;

  

  

(iii) the Indemnitor fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnitee
of its financial capacity to prosecute the Third Party Defense;

  

  

(iv) the Third Party Claim could give rise to Losses that are more than the
remaining unreserved amount of the Escrow Fund; or

  

  

(v) the Third Party Claim relates to a breach of Section 5.22.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the Contrary, for the
purposes of any notices under this Article X, the Buyer shall have satisfied
its obligations by providing notice to the Representatives in accordance with
Section 11.1.

  

  

(f) The provisions of Section 10.6(b), (c), and (d) shall not apply to Third
Party Claims pertaining to Taxes.

  

  

10.7 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. In the event of a
claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against it, the
Indemnitee shall send a Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor. The Notice of Claim
shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if not known, an estimate of the
foreseeable maximum amount of claimed Losses (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Losses) and a description of the basis
for such claim. The Indemnitor will have 30 days from receipt of such Notice
of Claim to dispute the claim and the Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate and
assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of the claim for indemnity.
If the Indemnitor does not give notice to the Indemnitee that it disputes such
claim within 30 days after its receipt of the Notice of Claim, the claim
specified in such Notice of Claim will be conclusively deemed a Loss subject
to indemnification hereunder.

  

 

 

 

  

 

105  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.8 Limitations of Liability; Determinations of Loss Amount; Exclusive
Remedies.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this
Agreement for any Losses to the extent such Indemnitee has previously been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provisions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including any adjustments to the
Adjusted Gross Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5.

  

  

(b) The Losses suffered by any Indemnitee shall be calculated after giving
effect to amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee from third parties,
including, without limitation, amounts actually recovered from insurance
proceeds or, with respect to a claim against a letter of credit, amounts
recovered from the customer for whose benefit that letter of credit was
obtained in connection with the issue giving rise to the claim against the
letter of credit. If any such amounts are actually recovered by an Indemnitee
subsequent to the receipt by such Indemnitee of an indemnification payment
hereunder for the claims to which such recoveries relate, the Indemnitee shall
hold such recovered amounts in trust and promptly refund to each Indemnitor
its Pro Rata Share of such amount (less any costs incurred by the Indemnitee
in recovering any such amount). By way of illustration, should Buyer recover
amounts from a customer for whose benefit a letter of credit is obtained by
remedying the performance or other issue that caused the letter of credit to
be drawn upon or called, then such recovered amounts less a pro rata share of
all costs and expenses of the Buyer to remedy the performance or other issue
shall be held by the Buyer in trust for the Sellers and refunded as indicated
in the prior sentence.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party shall
be liable under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement for any
consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages, whether based on
contract, tort, strict liability, or other Law or otherwise and whether or not
arising from the other Party's sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict
liability or other fault except to the extent included in a Third Party Claim.

  

  

(d) Except with respect to Claims based on fraud, the Parties hereby agree
that following the Closing, no Party shall have any liability, and no Party
shall make any Claim for any Losses or other matter under, relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, or in connection with any of the Contemplated
Transactions, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or
otherwise, except as provided in this Article X.

  

  

(e) No Seller shall have any liability under the Employment Agreements or
Officer Release Agreements except the Sellers that are party thereto.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Buyer, any Buyer Indemnitee or any Acquired Company incurs Losses
resulting from an Environmental Claim at the Shreveport Property, Buyer, such
Buyer Indemnitee, or such Acquired Company, as the case may be, shall solely
seek to recover such Losses from B27 RE, Inc. and its predecessor or successor
entities and not from the Escrow Agreement or any Seller directly, unless
otherwise agreed in writing with any such Person.

  

 

 

 

  

 

106  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.9 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments

  

  

. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, any indemnification payment
made hereunder shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
consideration payable under this Agreement.

  

  

10.10 Limitations on Parent Shareholder Obligations.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 10.10(b):

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (A) no Parent Shareholder
(other than Champlain, Ardia, B28 and 2Under) is making any representation or
warranty herein other than those representations and warranties about such
Parent Shareholder set forth in Article IV hereof and (B) absent fraud by a
Parent Shareholder, the cumulative indemnification obligation of such Parent
Shareholder (other than Champlain, Ardia, B28 and 2Under) under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 7.12(b), and the Ancillary
Agreements shall in no event exceed such Parent Shareholder\'s Individual
Aggregate Cap.

  

  

(ii) All deliveries otherwise required to be made to Buyer by the Parent
Shareholders pursuant to Sections 2.4(b), 2.4(d), 8.2 and in any other
provision of this Agreement and all covenants otherwise required to be
performed by the Parent Shareholders pursuant to Article VII and in any other
provision of this Agreement, including the delivery of documents executed by
Parent Shareholders shall be made and performed in all respects (including by
providing such documents executed by Parent Shareholders), respectively, by
Champlain, Ardia, B28 and 2Under and not by the Parent Shareholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Champlain, Ardia, B28 and 2Under shall
be severally, and not jointly, liable for a breach by any such Seller of
Section 7.13(a) or (b).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and with this
Section 10.10(b) taking absolute priority over any other provision in this
Agreement, including Section 10.10(a), Section 10.2 and Section 10.3,
Champlain, Ardia, B28 and 2Under shall indemnify and hold the Buyer
Indemnitees harmless from and against, and shall defend them against, any and
all Losses (i) suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee to the extent,
directly or indirectly, arising out of or resulting from any breach of or
failure by Champlain, Ardia, B28 and 2Under to fulfill the obligations of
Section 10.10(a)(ii), and (ii) that the Buyer Indemnitees would otherwise be
able to recover from the other Parent Shareholders under this Agreement if it
weren't for the provisions of Section 10.10(a).

11.2 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of this Agreement will be effective
unless it is in writing and signed by the Buyer and both of the
Representatives. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be
effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver,
and no such waiver will constitute a waiver of satisfaction of any other
provision of this Agreement. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof of the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

  

  

11.3 Expenses. Each party hereto shall bear its own expenses with respect to
this transaction and the preparation and execution of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and all agreements referred to herein and therein, it
being understood that any expenses of the Parent and the Acquired Companies,
whether such expenses were incurred in 2012 or 2013, shall be borne by the
Sellers as Sellers' Transaction Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Buyer shall pay any HSR Act filing fee in
connection with the Contemplated Transaction, unless Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iii) in which case Sellers shall
severally, but not jointly, be responsible to reimburse Buyer for their Pro
Rata Share of the entire filing fee within 10 Business Days from such
termination.

  

  

11.4 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties and their respective successors and assigns; provided, that no

Affiliate of the Assigning Party, in each case provided that advance notice of
such assignment is given to the Non-assigning Party, such Affiliate enters
into a written agreement with the Non-assigning Party to be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement in all respects and to the same extent as the
Assigning Party is bound and that the Assigning Party will continue to be
bound by all obligations hereunder as if such assignment had not occurred and
perform such obligations to the extent that such Affiliate fails to do so or
(ii) the Buyer may collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement in
connection with any secured loan arrangement.

11.7 Arbitration of Disputes.

  

  

(a) Scope. Any controversy, dispute or claim, whether based on contract, tort,
statute or other legal or equitable theory (including any claim of fraud,
misrepresentation or fraudulent inducement or any question of validity or
effect of this Agreement) between the Parties arising out of or related to or
in connection with this Agreement (including any amendments or extensions
hereto) or any Ancillary Agreement, any transactions arising under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and/or the breach or termination of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (hereinafter the "Dispute"), shall be
exclusively and finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the
then-current rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). In the
event of any conflict between the provisions of such rules and the provisions
hereof, this Agreement shall govern and control.

  

  

(b) Initiating a Claim. An arbitration shall be commenced by delivery by a
party of a Notice of Arbitration by facsimile and/or by overnight mail,
federal express or courier to the other party to the Dispute in accordance
with Section 11.1 and to the AAA. The arbitration shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date the Notice of Arbitration is received by the respondent.
The Notice of Arbitration shall include a brief statement of the claim, the
amount of damages claimed and all information required by the AAA rules.

  

  

(c) Location and Language. The seat or location of the arbitration shall be
Houston, Texas. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

  

  

(d) Selection and Qualifications of Arbitrators. If the amount in controversy
is less than $1,000,000 there shall be one arbitrator, otherwise there shall
be three arbitrators (hereinafter, whether one or three arbitrators, referred
to as the "Panel"). All arbitrators shall be impartial and independent. At the
time of the filing its Notice of Arbitration, the claimant shall name one
arbitrator if the matter requires a Panel of three arbitrators and, within 14
days thereafter, respondent shall name one arbitrator. Within 28 days after
respondent's receipt of the Notice of Arbitration, the parties shall attempt
to agree upon either the sole or the third arbitrator. If a party fails to
name an arbitrator, or should the parties be unable to agree upon the sole or
third arbitrator by the stated time, the AAA shall make the selection. Each
arbitrator shall be qualified by education, experience, and training to
determine the issues in dispute and shall have been practicing law for at
least 20 years.

  

 

 

 

  

 

111  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Timing and Decision by the Panel. The Panel shall endeavor to have the
parties proceed to hearing in a reasonably expeditious manner, but shall
ensure that the parties have a fair and reasonable opportunity to develop and
then to present their claims and defenses. The Panel shall render a decision
within 60 days of the close of the hearing unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties. The Panel shall have the award issued within one year from the time
the Panel is constituted. The Panel shall issue a reasoned award in writing.
The award may be enforced and a judgment entered by any court of competent
jurisdiction. The award shall be computed and paid in United States dollars by
wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by the prevailing Party.

  

  

(f) Governing Law and Costs and Expenses. In deciding a Dispute, the Panel
shall apply and utilize the substantive law of the State of Texas, including
such matters as whether the party's attorney's fees are recoverable and
whether, at what rate, and under what circumstances, interest is recoverable,
but the use of such substantive law shall be without regard to any conflict of
law principle or rules. The costs of the arbitration and of the arbitrators
shall be split between the parties. The Panel may, as part of its decision,
award all or part of such costs, as well as expert fees and costs, to the
prevailing party. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if the Dispute is an
indemnification claim under Article X, if the Indemnitor is the prevailing
party in whole or in any part, all costs and expenses of the Indemnitee are
Losses and shall be reimbursed by the Indemnitor in accordance with the terms
of Article X.

  

  

(g) Discovery. The parties agree that each is entitled to all forms of
discovery and disclosure permitted by Texas law. The Panel shall have the
power to determine the amount of such discovery and disclosure and how it will
be conducted to the extent not agreed to by the parties. The Panel shall also
have the power to order the parties to provide documents, witness lists,
expert witness reports, and such other materials or information needed for an
efficient hearing. The Panel shall promptly schedule and hold an initial
prehearing conference and any other conferences to determine any and all such
matters.

  

  

(h) Confidentiality. The parties agree that the arbitration hearings held
pursuant hereto shall not be open to any third party. Such hearings are to be
private and limited to the arbitrators, court reporters, the parties, their
counsel, their representatives, and the witnesses. The Parties further agree
to maintain the confidentiality of, and not to disclose to a third party, any
information, documents, or things regarding any arbitral proceeding or
disclosed in the course thereof, except as required by law, regulation, a bona
fide business purpose, and/or unless required in connection with an action to
enforce, nullify, modify, or correct an award.

  

  

(i) Separability and Limitations. This provision to arbitrate shall survive
termination of the Agreement.

  

 

 

 

  

 

112  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(j) Enforceability and Severability. If any part of this arbitration provision
is held to be unenforceable, it shall be severed and shall not affect either
the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this provision.

  

  

(k) Additional Powers of the Panel. In order to prevent irreparable harm and
to preserve the status quo, the Panel, once constituted, shall have the power
to grant temporary or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief, but this
is not intended to change the fact that the Panel is to provide a reasoned
award. This may include the authority to hear, rule on, and grant or deny
requests for temporary or interim relief if necessary to maintain the status
quo during the pendency of an arbitration. The parties shall comply with
orders of the Panel in this regard during the pendency of a Dispute. Any
temporary or interim order issued by the Panel for the purpose of maintaining
the status quo during the pendency of a proceeding shall include a requirement
that the parties shall abide by the outcome of the arbitration.

  

  

(l) Court-Ordered Interim Relief. At any time after giving notice of a
dispute, any party may request a court of competent jurisdiction to grant
interim measures of protection: (1) to preserve the status quo pending
resolution of the Dispute, (2) to prevent the destruction or loss of documents
and other information or things relating to the Dispute, (3) to prevent the
transfer, dissipation, or hiding of assets, and/or (4) to aid the arbitration
proceedings and the award. A request for such interim measures to a judicial
authority shall not be deemed incompatible with the provisions of this dispute
resolution agreement or a waiver of a party's right to arbitrate.

  

  

11.8 Counterparts. The parties may sign this Agreement in several
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which when
taken together will constitute one original Agreement. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by facsimile or by email in portable document format
(.pdf) or by electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of
2000 using www.docusign.com, provided that a copy of the physical audit trail
is concurrently delivered to Buyer and delivery of the signature page by such
method will be deemed to have the same effect as if the original signature had
been delivered to the other parties.

  

  

11.9 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 7.11, this
Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon
any Person, including any employee, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or
any collective bargaining representative thereof, other than the parties to
this Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of Article X, the other
Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal
representatives, successors and assigns, are intended third party
beneficiaries of the provisions contained in such Article.

  

  

11.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the
Exhibits, the Schedules and the other documents, instruments and other

understanding and final agreement between the parties. It is the complete and
exclusive expression of the parties' agreement on the subject matter of this

11.11 Captions. All captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

11.12 Disclosure Letters. The Disclosure Letters have been arranged in
sections corresponding to each representation and warranty set forth in
Article III, Article IV, Article V, and Article VI. Any information disclosed
pursuant to any Schedule hereto shall be deemed to be disclosed for all
purposes of any other Schedule to this Agreement to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to such other Schedule is reasonably apparent on
its face so as to enable a reasonable person to determine that such disclosure
qualifies or otherwise applies to such other Schedule to this Agreement. The
mere listing of a contract or agreement in any Schedule will not be sufficient
to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty unless the
representation or warranty only pertains to the existence of such contract or
agreement. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth
of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides
otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

11.13 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Agreement, or application of that provision to any Persons or circumstances,
or in any jurisdiction, other than those as to which it is held unenforceable,
will not be affected by that unenforceability and will be enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by Law. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent
of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that
the Contemplated Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

  

  

11.14 Specific Performance. The Buyer and the Sellers each agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof and
that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity.

  

 

 

 

  

 

114  

  

 

 

 

  

  

11.15 Interpretation. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof.

  

  

11.16 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of Buyer shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of Buyer under this Agreement, unless such liability results only
from fraud or intentional wrongdoing.
