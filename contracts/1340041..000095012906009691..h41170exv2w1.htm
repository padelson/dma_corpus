controlling the Company, any Seller, Buyer of Buyer Sub or any of their Representatives whether
prior to or after the execution of this Agreement, until sixty (60)&nbsp;calendar days after the

such claim shall survive the end of the Survival Period of such representations, warranties,

Any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any

be adversely affected by such party&#146;s knowledge on or before the Closing Date of any breach of the

court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such proceeding, with the burden of proof
resting with the Indemnifying Party, that a director or officer of the party seeking
indemnification had actual knowledge of the breach of such representation or warranty. The waiver
of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of
or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not adversely affect the right to
indemnification, payment of losses or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
