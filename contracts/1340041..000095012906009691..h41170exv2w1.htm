In the event that any such vesting, exercisability or other payment would not be so deductible, then, only to the extent necessary to make such portion of the Stock Option Total Payment deductible, the accelerated vesting and exercisability of such Cashed-Out Company   #####

In the event that any such vesting or other payment would not be so deductible, then, only to the extent necessary to make such portion of the Restricted Stock Total Payment deductible, the accelerated vesting of such Restricted Stock (and any other such payment with respect thereto) shall be reduced (if necessary, to zero) (the " _Restricted Stock Section 280G Cap_").

 (a) Buyer has filed all quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all other material registration statements, forms, reports and documents required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (" _Buyer Disclosure Documents_ "), all of which, as amended if applicable, complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, each as in effect on the dates such Buyer Disclosure Documents were filed. None of such Buyer Disclosure Documents, including any financial

statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein,
contained, when filed, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited
financial statements of Buyer contained in the Buyer Disclosure Documents
were prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect as of the dates of
such filings, applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved

and cash flows of Buyer and its subsidiaries, as of the dates and for
the periods referred to therein.

respects the Liabilities (including all reserves), the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of Buyer as at the respective
dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements.
Such financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto)
throughout the periods involved in all material respects. The books and
records of Buyer and each Subsidiary of Buyer have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable
legal and accounting requirements as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability. 

  

SECTION 6.09. No Reliance. Each of Buyer and Buyer Sub acknowledges that none

its Subsidiaries, their respective businesses or financial condition or any of
their assets, liabilities or operations or other matters, except for the
specific representations and warranties set forth in Article IV and Article V
hereof and the applicable sections of the Disclosure Letter. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, none of the Sellers, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have any liability to
Buyer or its Affiliates, including Buyer Sub, on any basis (including in
contract or tort, fraud under federal or state securities laws or otherwise)
other than fraud under common law (as opposed to fraud as defined by Texas
Business and Commerce Code Section 27.01) with respect to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries,
their respective businesses or financial condition or any of their assets,
liabilities or operations or other matters, except to the extent that the
Company and the Sellers make the specific representations and warranties set
forth in Article IV and Article V hereof, but always subject to the
limitations and restrictions contained in this Agreement.

to any party unless and until they shall become public knowledge (other 

    ##### 

  

    

than by disclosure in breach of this Section 7.01) or as required by
applicable Laws, including applicable securities laws and regulations or as
necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , before

    #####

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted to release either Buyer or Buyer Sub from any of its obligations
to Sellers under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. 

   

 (b) Each Seller represents and warrants to the Company, Buyer and Buyer Sub that there has been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any Claim released pursuant to Section 7.05(a) (" _Released Claims_ "), and such Seller agrees to indemnify and hold the Releasees harmless from any Liability, Claims or attorneys fees or expenses incurred as a result of any Person asserting any such assignment or transfer of any rights or Claims under any such assignment or transfer from such Seller. 

   

 (c) Each Seller represents and warrants to the Company, Buyer and Buyer Sub that it has not filed, nor has as of the date hereof, any Released Claims against any of the Releasees. Each Seller agrees that if such Seller hereafter commences, joins in, or in any manner seeks relief through any suit arising out of, based upon, or relating to any of the Released Claims, or in any manner asserts against the Releasees any of the Released Claims, including, without limitation, through any motion to reconsider, reopen or appeal the dismissal of the suit or action, then such Seller will pay to the Releasees against whom such claim(s) is asserted, in addition to any other damages caused thereby, all expenses and costs (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) incurred by such Releasees in defending or otherwise responding to said Released Claim.

 SECTION 7.06. Employee Matters. 

   

 (a) During the period from the date hereof through at least December 31, 2006, Buyer agrees to cause the Company to provide for the benefit of the employees of the Company as of the date hereof who continue to be employed by the Company following the Closing (the " _Company Employees_ "), employee benefits which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer Sub. 

   

 (b) To the extent service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, participation or vesting or receipt of benefits under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement 

    ##### 

  

    

established or maintained by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer in which Company
Employees may participate (other than the accrual of benefits under a pension
plan), subject to the terms of such plan, program or arrangement, such
Company Employees shall be credited for service accrued as of the date
hereof with the Company to the extent such service was credited under a
similar plan, program or arrangement of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
no such credit shall be provided to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of credit or benefits. 

   

 (c) To the extent a Company Employee and his or her dependents enroll in any welfare plan sponsored by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer (a " _Buyer Welfare Plan_ "), subject to the terms of such plan, program or arrangement, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Buyer Welfare Plan (i) to waive all preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods otherwise applicable to a Company Employee and his or her dependents, other than exclusions or waiting periods that are in effect with respect to such individuals immediately prior to the Closing to the extent not satisfied, under the corresponding benefit plans of the Company, and (ii) to provide each Company Employee and his or her dependents with corresponding credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by them under the corresponding benefit plans of the Company during the portion of the respective plan year prior to the date such Company Employee enrolls in the applicable Buyer Welfare Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , no such credit shall be provided to the extent that it would result in a duplication of credit or benefits. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Plan, or shall limit the right of Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, including Buyer Sub, to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan following the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a party other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any Plan, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such Plan even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect. 

   

 (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained in this Section 7.06 with respect to the Company Employees are included for the sole benefit of the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any employees, former employees, any participant in any Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Buyer, Buyer Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. 

   

 SECTION 7.07. Termination of Certain Prior Agreements. 

   

 (a) The Stockholders Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement that expressly, by implication or otherwise would survive cancellation or termination of the Stockholders Agreement) is hereby canceled and terminated, is null and void and has no further force or effect. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each party to the Stockholders Agreement shall automatically be released and forever discharged from any and all duties, covenants, obligations, controversies, claims, demands, actions, causes of action and other liabilities (whether known or unknown or matured or unmatured and whether arising with respect to or otherwise relating to the period prior to, on or 

    ##### 

  

    

after the date hereof) under, in connection with, arising out of or relating
or attributable to the Stockholders Agreement NOTWITHSTANDING THE STRICT
LIABILITY OR NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GROSS NEGLIGENCE),
WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, OF SUCH PARTY OR

ARTICLE VIII 

   

INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 SECTION 8.01. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and effect until (and claims based upon or arising out of such representations and warranties may be asserted at any time before) the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, except with respect to the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 4.02, the Sellers in Section 5.05 and Buyer and Buyer Sub in Section 6.06 of this Agreement, which shall survive the Closing and remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company, any Seller, Buyer or Buyer Sub, any Person controlling the Company, any Seller, Buyer of Buyer Sub or any of their Representatives whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement, until sixty (60) calendar days after the expiration of the applicable period of statute of limitations (giving effect to any waivers or extensions thereof). The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto in this Agreement shall survive the Closing without any contractual limitation on the period of survival (other than those covenants and agreements that are expressly required to remain in full force and effect for a specified period time). The period of time a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this Section 8.01 shall be the " _Survival Period_ " with respect to such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. So long as an Indemnified Party gives written notice of indemnification claim in reasonable detail on or before the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue its rights to indemnification under Section 8.02(a) or (b) hereof, as applicable. In the event notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 8.02(a) or (b) hereof shall have been 

    ##### 

  

    

given within the applicable Survival Period and such claim has not been
finally resolved by the expiration of such Survival Period, the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements that are the subject
of such claim shall survive the end of the Survival Period of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements until such claim is
finally resolved, but such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall only survive with respect to such asserted claim. Any claim
by an Indemnified Party for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by
any investigation by or opportunity to investigate afforded to the such
party, nor shall such a claim be adversely affected by such partys knowledge
on or before the Closing Date of any breach of the type specified in Section
8.02(a) or (b) unless it shall be determined by a final judgment of a court
or administrative body having jurisdiction over such proceeding, with the
burden of proof resting with the Indemnifying Party, that a director or
officer of the party seeking indemnification had actual knowledge of the
breach of such representation or warranty. The waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance
of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not adversely affect
the right to indemnification, payment of losses or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.01, the limitations set forth
in this Article VIII shall not apply in the case of claims based on fraud
under common law (as opposed to fraud as defined by Texas Business and
Commerce Code Section 27.01) or willful misconduct. 

   

 SECTION 8.02. Indemnification. 

   

 (a) From and after the Closing, each Seller and Cashed-Out Holder (each Seller and Cashed-Out Holder, in its capacity as an indemnifying party under this Article VIII, a " _Seller Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, severally but not jointly, indemnify, save and hold harmless Buyer, Buyer Sub and their Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company from and after the Closing) and Representatives (each, in its capacity as an indemnified party under this Article VIII, a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all costs, losses, Liabilities, obligations, damages, claims, judgment, demands and expenses (whether or not arising out of third party claims), including interest, penalties, fines, Tax, costs of mitigation, reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing (herein, " _Damages_ "), to the extent incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to: 

    

 (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or such Seller in this Agreement; and 

   

 (ii) any claim arising from the Sellers Representatives performance of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing, each of Buyer and Buyer Sub (in its capacity as an indemnifying party under this Article VIII, a " _Buyer Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnifying Parties_ " and together with the Seller Indemnifying Parties, each an " _Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, save and hold harmless each Seller and Cashed-Out Holder and its Affiliates and Representatives (in their capacity as indemnified parties under this Article VIII and together with 

    ##### 

  

    

the Buyer Indemnified Parties, each an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all
Damages to the extent incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting
from or incident to any breach of any representation or warranty made by
either Buyer or Buyer Sub in this Agreement. 

   

 (c) (i) The term " _Damages_ " as used in this Section 8.02 is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against such Indemnified Party, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Party in the absence of Third-Party Claims. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the Company suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages to the extent incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company and/or a Seller in this Agreement or any claim arising from the Sellers Representatives performance of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement, then Buyer Sub shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Company, to have incurred Damages to the same extent. 

    

 (ii) For purposes of this Article VIII, Damages incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Party arising out of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be determined without deduction on account of any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification contained in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 8.03. Procedure for Claims between Parties. If a claim for Damages (an " _Indemnity Claim_ "), other than Third-Party Claims under Section 8.04 below, is to be made by an Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification hereunder, such party shall give written notice briefly describing the claim and the total monetary damages sought (each, a " _Notice_ ") to the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, and the Escrow Agent as soon as practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which gives rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under this Article VIII. Any failure to submit any such notice of claim to the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, except to the extent that the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, demonstrate that an Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure. The Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have accepted the Notice and Sellers or the Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have agreed to pay the Damages at issue, and the parties shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse funds from the Indemnification Escrow in an amount sufficient to pay the Damages, if the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, do not send a notice of disagreement to the Indemnified Party within 30 calendar days after receiving the Notice pursuant to Section 8.05. 

   

 SECTION 8.04. Defense of Third-Party Claims. If an Indemnity Claim is to be made by an Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification hereunder in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any third party (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall give a Notice to the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, as soon as practicable after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Sellers 

    ##### 

  

    

Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, demonstrate
that an Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure. The
Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be,
shall have 30 days (or less if the nature of the Third-Party Claim requires)
from its receipt of the Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether
(subject to the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may
be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion) the Indemnifying Party or
Parties desire, at the Indemnifying Partys and Parties sole cost
and expense and by counsel of its own choosing (who shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party or Parties), to assume the defense
against such Third-Party Claim; provided that, if the Indemnified Party has
been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more
legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Parties cost, risk
and expense, to one separate counsel of its own choosing (who shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party or Parties). The Indemnifying
Party or Parties shall compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim only with
the written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that any such compromise
or settlement shall provide for the absolute and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Parties from any Liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim
and shall provide for only the payment of monetary Damages and shall not
create any continuing obligation of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates or otherwise adversely affect the operations of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates. If the Sellers Representative or Buyer
Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with
the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be,
and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third-Party
Claim and any appeal arising therefrom, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may,
at its own cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such
lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom. If the
Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be,
fail to assume the defense of such claim within fifteen (15) calendar days
after receipt of the Notice (whether as a result of its election not to
assume such defense or the refusal of the Indemnified Party or Parties to
grant a request of the Indemnifying Party or Parties to assume such defense),
the Indemnified Party against which such claim has been asserted will have
the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense,
the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of
and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such claim shall not be compromised or settled without the
written consent of the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties,
as the case may be, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the
Indemnified Party will keep the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying
Parties, as the case may be, reasonably informed of the progress of any such
defense, compromise or settlement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party may, at its own cost, participate in the investigation,
trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom.
The Indemnifying Party or Parties shall be liable for any settlement of
any Third-Party Claim effect ed pursuant to and in accordance with this
Section 8.04 and for any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal),
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.02. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 8.05. Resolution of Conflicts and Claims. 

   

 (a) If the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, object in writing to any claim for indemnification made by an Indemnified Party in any written Notice of a claim (an " _Objection Notice_ "), the Sellers Representative and Buyer Indemnifying Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims, and the Sellers Representative and Buyer Indemnifying Parties shall provide information to the other party (as reasonably requested) related to the issues set forth in the Objection Notice. If the Sellers Representative and the Buyer Indemnifying Parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by such parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute funds from the Indemnification Escrow in accordance with the terms thereof. 

   

 (b) If no such agreement is reached after good faith negotiation, either the Sellers Representative or Buyer Indemnifying Parties may demand mediation of the dispute, unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in a pending action or proceeding involving a Third-Party Claim, in which event mediation shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to mediation. In any such mediation, the Sellers Representative and Buyer Indemnifying Parties agree to employ a mediator to assist them in reaching resolution of such dispute according to the Commercial Mediation Rules of the AAA. The mediator shall be a corporate attorney practicing in Houston, Texas, with at least fifteen (15) years experience in mergers and acquisitions. The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be shared equally by the Sellers Representative and Buyer Indemnifying Parties. If, after mediation efforts, the Sellers Representative and Buyer Indemnifying Parties should agree as to all or a portion of a claim, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by such parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute funds from the Indemnification Escrow in accordance with the terms thereof. If after reasonable efforts, and over a period of sixty (60) calendar days, the parties are unable to reach agreement on such dispute utilizing the mediator, the parties shall be permitted to proceed with any other remedy available to such party. 

   

 SECTION 8.06. Limitations on Indemnity. No Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to, indemnification from any of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 8.02(a) to the extent the aggregate claims for Damages of the Indemnified Parties are less than $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ ") or exceed an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , that, if the aggregate of all claims for Damages equals or exceeds the Threshold, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover for Damages subject to the limitations in this Section 8.06 only to the extent such Damages exceed the Threshold and do not exceed the Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Indemnified Parties are seeking, or are entitled to seek, indemnification from any of the Indemnifying Parties for Damages due to (i) Buyers, Buyer Subs, the Companys or any Sellers fraud under common law (as opposed to fraud as defined by Texas Business and Commerce Code Section 27.01) or willful misconduct or (ii) breaches of the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 4.02, the Sellers in Section 5.05 or Buyer in Section 6.06 of this Agreement, the limitations in this Section 8.06 (including the Threshold and the Cap) shall not be applicable to, or otherwise limit an Indemnified Partys recovery for, such claim; _provided_ , that, for breaches of the representations 

    ##### 

  

    

and warranties set forth in clause (ii) above, no Sellers aggregate
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall exceed the
product obtained by multiplying $800 by the number of Company Shares sold by
such Seller hereunder, no Cashed-Out Holders aggregate obligation to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall exceed the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the difference between $800 and the exercise price of such
Cashed-Out Holders Cashed-Out Options by (B) the number of Company Shares
that were subject to such Cashed-Out Options immediately prior to
the Closing, and Buyer and Buyer Subs aggregate obligation to indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Parties shall not exceed the Purchase Price. 

   

 SECTION 8.07. Payment of Damages. The parties agree that any and all indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnifying Parties hereunder (except with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.02 and Section 5.05) shall be satisfied solely from available amounts of the Indemnification Escrow then on deposit with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. With respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.02 and Section 5.05, the Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash by the Indemnifying Party the amount to which the Indemnified Party may become entitled by reason of the provisions of this Article VIII, within five (5) calendar days after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement of the parties or pursuant to the mediation proceeding described in Section 8.05(b) of this Agreement or on the date on which both such amount and the Indemnified Partys obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final judgment of a court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such proceeding. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 8.08. Sellers Representative. 

   

 (a) SCF-VI, L.P. shall be the Sellers Representative (the " _Sellers  Representative_") and as such shall serve as and have all powers as agent and attorney-in-fact of each Seller and Cashed-Out Holder, for and on behalf of such Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders: (i) to give and receive notices and communications; (ii) to have authority to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand mediation and comply with orders of courts and awards of Governmental Entities with respect to any disputes involving any Indemnity Claims made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties; (iii) to litigate, mediate, arbitrate, defend, enforce or to take any other actions and execute the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and any other documents that the Sellers Representative deems advisable in connection with enforcing any rights or obligations or defending any claim or action under this Agreement on behalf of the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders; (iv) to sign receipts, consents, or other documents to effect the transactions contemplated hereby; (v) to authorize the delivery to any Buyer Indemnified Party of the Indemnification Escrow, or any portion thereof, in satisfaction of any Indemnity Claims; and (vi) to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. If SCF-VI, L.P. ceases to act as Sellers Representative for any reason, such Sellers Representative or his agent shall notify Buyer and Buyer Sub of such Sellers Representatives intent to resign as Sellers Representative, and the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders entitled to receive a majority of the Purchase Price shall, by written notice to Buyer and Buyer Sub, appoint a successor Sellers Representative within thirty (30) days. Notice or communications to or from any Sellers Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders. 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 8.08(a), in the event of (i) the death or permanent disability of the Sellers Representative, (ii) his, her or its resignation as a Sellers Representative, or (iii) the removal of the Sellers Representative by Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders entitled to receive a majority of the Purchase Price, a successor Sellers Representative shall be elected by the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders entitled to receive a majority of the Purchase Price. Each successor Sellers Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement upon the original Sellers Representative, and the term "Sellers Representative" as used herein and therein shall be deemed to include successor Sellers Representatives. 

   

 (c) The Sellers Representative may, in all questions arising under this Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel, and shall not be liable to the Sellers or any other Person for any action taken or not taken as a Sellers Representative in the absence of such Sellers Representatives willful misconduct. 

   

 (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders, and Buyer, Buyer Sub, the Escrow Agent and the Company may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and all of the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders. Buyer, Buyer Sub, the Escrow Agent and the Company are relieved from any Liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative. Although the Sellers Representative shall 

    ##### 

  

    

not be obligated to obtain instructions from the Sellers and Cashed-Out
Holders prior to any decision, act, consent or instruction, if, and to the
extent that, the Sellers Representative receives any written instructions
from the Sellers and Cashed-Out Holders entitled to receive a majority of the
Purchase Price, the Sellers Representative shall comply with such
instructions. 

   

 SECTION 8.09. Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Section 8.08, the parties agree that the sole and exclusive remedy of any party to this Agreement or their respective Affiliates or other Indemnified Parties with respect to this Agreement or any other claims relating to the events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions provided for in this Agreement or contemplated by this Agreement or by any other such claims relating to the events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions provided for in this Agreement shall be limited to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII. 

   

 SECTION 8.10. Actual Fraud. Nothing in this Agreement (including this Article VIII) shall prevent any party from making a claim against any other party for actual fraud involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of a fact material to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 SECTION 8.11. No Special Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE UNDER THIS ARTICLE VIII OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM, IN WHICH EVENT SUCH DAMAGES SHALL BE RECOVERABLE. 

   

 SECTION 8.12. No Duplication. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 SECTION 9.03. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to articles, sections, exhibits or schedules, such reference shall be to an article or Section of or exhibit or schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, glossary of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Each party hereto has participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden or proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. 

   

 SECTION 9.04. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

   

 SECTION 9.05. Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. 

   

 (a) This Agreement (including the Disclosure Letter) and the Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 9.06. Governing Law. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes between the parties under or related to the Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within the State of Texas, without regard to the laws that might be applicable under conflicts of laws principles. 

   

 SECTION 9.07. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as 

    ##### 

  

    

possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only
in part, degree or certain jurisdictions will remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, each party waives any provision of law which renders any
provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect. 

   

 SECTION 9.08. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise, including, without limitation, by merger or consolidation), without the prior written consent of each of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

   

 SECTION 9.09. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

   

 SECTION 9.10. Acknowledgment. Each of the Sellers hereby acknowledges that such party has had reasonable opportunity to read and understand this Agreement and their respective legal counsel has had reasonable opportunity to review and comment on this Agreement.
