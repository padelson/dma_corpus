iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " _Agreement_
"), dated as of November 13, 2005, between Koch Industries, Inc., a Kansas
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Koch Forest Products, Inc., a Georgia corporation
and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and
Georgia-Pacific Corporation, a Georgia corporation (the " _Company_ ").



WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
has approved, and deems it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective shareholders to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by
Parent upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;



WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has
agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the
Common Stock of the Company (the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of
$48.00 (such amount or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the
Offer being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash;



WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board
of Directors_ ") has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, approved the Offer and adopted this Agreement, and is recommending
that the Companys shareholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to
Purchaser and approve this Agreement;



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company have approved the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company with
the Company as the survivor, as set forth below (the " _Merger_ ," and
together with the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the " _Transactions_ "), in accordance with
the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ "), and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued
and outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or
the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in
cash; and



WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to (i) make
certain representations and warranties, (ii) enter into certain covenants and
agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and (iii) prescribe
various conditions to the Offer and the Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
promises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties to this Agreement agree as follows:



ARTICLE I.



THE OFFER AND MERGER



Section 1.1 _The Offer_. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, and subject to compliance in all
material respects by    the Company with its covenants in this Section 1.1 and Section 1.2, as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) business days after
the date hereof, Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer
to purchase for cash all Shares at the Offer Price, subject to (i) there
being validly tendered in the Offer (in the aggregate) and not withdrawn prior
to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares which, together with the
Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries, represents at
least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis and no
less than a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors or upon
the approval of this Agreement, in each case on a fully diluted basis
(collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the satisfaction or
waiver of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. Subject
to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the prior satisfaction
or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the other conditions and requirements set
forth in Annex I, Purchaser shall consummate the Offer in accordance with its
terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable after Purchaser is legally permitted to do so
under applicable law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the initial expiration
date of the Offer shall be the date that is twenty (20) business days
following the commencement of the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to accept
for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the
expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject to the Minimum
Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I.
Neither Parent nor Purchaser may waive the Minimum Condition, decrease the
Offer Price, change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, reduce
the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer or impose conditions
to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I without the prior
written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if, as of
any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, all conditions to the Offer shall
not have been satisfied or waived, Purchaser may, from time to time, in its
sole discretion, extend the expiration date of the Offer for such period (not
to exceed ten (10) business days on any single occasion) as Purchaser may
determine, to a date that is no later than March 31, 2006, or such later date
which is no later than the third (3rd) business day following the latest of
(1) the date on which Parents and Purchasers rights of negotiation expire
under Section 8.1(f), (2) any Recommendation Deadline and (3) the twentieth
(20th) business day following receipt by Parent or Purchaser of a notice
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii)(B); _provided_ , that the failure of the Offer
to be consummated, at the time of such extension, shall not (other than in
circumstances described in clause (3)) be a result of Parent or Purchaser
having failed to comply in any material respect with its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement and (B) if applicable, Purchaser shall
extend the Offer after the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a further
period of time by means of a subsequent offering period under Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act of not less than three (3) or more than ten
(10) business days, if necessary, in order to meet the objective that there
be validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the
expiration of such subsequent offering period, and not withdrawn a number of
Shares which, together with Shares then beneficially owned by Parent,
Purchaser and/or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent represents at
least 90% of the then outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis and (C) if,
as of any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the events described
in paragraphs (c), (d) or



 

2  (e) of Annex I has occurred and is continuing, then, at the request of the
Company (received prior to the then scheduled expiration date of the
Offer), Purchaser shall extend the Offer, until 5:00 p.m. New York City time
on the date that is the later of (1) the date Parent would otherwise be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) or Section
8.1(b)(iii), as applicable, and (2) the third (3rd) business day following
the date on which the matters which gave rise to the events described in
paragraphs (c), (d) or (e) of Annex I have been cured or waived by Purchaser
such that the conditions in Annex I are then satisfied or waived (it being
understood that Purchaser may effect such extension through a series of
extensions of such duration(s) as Purchaser may determine); _provided_ , that
the Company shall not be entitled to require Parent to extend the Offer
pursuant to this clause (C) on more than one occasion.



(b) (i) If (A) the Company has not delivered a Notice of Acquisition
Proposal, (B) the failure to achieve the Minimum Condition is not a result of
the Company having failed to comply in any material respect with any of its
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and (C) the conditions
and requirements of Annex I (other than the Minimum Condition) have been
satisfied or, if not then satisfied, are reasonably capable of being satisfied
before March 31, 2006, then, if at any scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, at the request of
the Company (received from time to time prior to the then scheduled expiration
date of the Offer and confirmed in writing), Purchaser shall extend the Offer
to a date requested by the Company (but no later than five (5) business days
beyond the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer on any single
occasion); _provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to extend
the expiration date of the Offer to any date later than March 31, 2006
pursuant to this Section 1.1(b)(i).



(ii) If (A) the Company delivers a Notice of Acquisition Proposal to Parent
and (B) the Company provides Parent with a written request (a " _Request_ ")
that Purchaser extend the expiration date of the Offer (which Request may or
may not be included in, and may be delivered later than, the Notice of
Acquisition Proposal), then Purchaser shall extend the Offer, to such date as
is necessary to assure that the Offer does not expire until fifteen (15)
business days (such date as it may be extended pursuant to this Section
1.1(b)(ii), the " _Recommendation Deadline_ ") from the date the Company
gives (or gave) such Notice of Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that (1) the
Company may not deliver a Request on more than one occasion; and (2) if the
Request was delivered on or prior to the twentieth (20th) business day
following the date of this Agreement and, during the four (4) business day
period ending on (and including) the date on which the Recommendation
Deadline occurs, the Company delivers to Parent a Notice of Acquisition
Proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group that does
not include any Person participating (other than solely as a source of debt
financing) in the Acquisition Proposal as to which the prior Notice of
Acquisition Proposal relates, then Purchaser shall, upon the request of the
Company, extend the expiration date of the Offer to such date as is necessary
to assure that the Offer does not expire until the fifth (5th) business day
following receipt of such second Notice of Acquisition Proposal and the
Recommendation Deadline shall automatically be extended to such fifth (5th)
business day.



(iii) Parent and Purchaser further agree that (A) if at any one or more
scheduled expiration dates of the Offer, any of the Regulatory Conditions have
not been  



 

3  satisfied (or such conditions have been satisfied and the date of such
satisfaction is after the third (3rd) business day preceding the date of
expiration of the Offer (an " _Abbreviated Expiration_ ")), but at such
scheduled expiration date all of the other conditions to the Offer set forth
in Annex I (other than the Minimum Condition) shall then be satisfied, or if
not then satisfied, are either (1) reasonably capable of being satisfied or
(2) unsatisfied (or not reasonably capable of being satisfied), as a result
of a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser, then, so long as the
failure of the Regulatory Conditions to be satisfied shall not be a result of
a breach by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, at the
request of the Company (received prior to the then-scheduled expiration date
of the Offer and confirmed in writing), Purchaser shall extend the expiration
date from time to time, to a date that is no later than March 31, 2006 and
(B) if at any one or more scheduled expiration dates of the Offer after March
31, 2006, any of the Antitrust Conditions has not been satisfied (or there has
been an Abbreviated Expiration with respect to the Antitrust Conditions),
but at such scheduled expiration date all of the other conditions to the
Offer set forth in Annex I (other than the Minimum Condition) shall then be
satisfied, or if not then satisfied, are either (1) reasonably capable of
being satisfied or (2) unsatisfied (or not reasonably capable of being
satisfied), as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser,
then, so long as the failure of the Antitrust Conditions to be satisfied shall
not be a result of a breach by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement, at the request of the Company (received prior to the then-scheduled
expiration date of the Offer and confirmed in writing), Purchaser shall extend
the expiration date from time to time, to a date that is no later than
September 14, 2006; _provided_ , that in the case of clause (A) and (B) of
this sentence, Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer by more
than ten (10) business days on any single occasion or, in the case of an
extension due to an Abbreviated Expiration, three (3) business days following
the Abbreviated Expiration.



(iv) Without limiting the right of Parent and Purchaser to extend the Offer
pursuant to Section 1.1(a), if at any one or more scheduled expiration dates
of the Offer on or after March 31, 2006, any of the Antitrust Conditions has
not been satisfied or waived (or there has been an Abbreviated Expiration with
respect to the Antitrust Conditions), but on such date all of the other
conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I (other than the Minimum
Condition) shall then be satisfied or waived, or if not then satisfied, are
either (A) reasonably capable of being satisfied or (B) unsatisfied (or
not reasonably capable of being satisfied) as a result of a breach of this
Agreement by the Company or a failure of the condition set forth in clause (d)
of Annex I, then, so long as the failure of the Antitrust Conditions to be
satisfied shall not be a result of a breach by Parent or Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser may, on one or more
occasions, extend the expiration date of the Offer to a date that is no later
than September 14, 2006;  _provided_ that Purchaser shall not extend the
expiration date by more than ten (10) business days on any single occasion
(or, in the case of an extension due to an Abbreviated Expiration, three (3)
business days following the Abbreviated Expiration).



(v) Purchaser may (A) increase the Offer Price and extend the Offer to the
extent required by applicable law in connection with such price increase and
(B) subject to prior consultation with the Company, extend the expiration date
of the Offer to the  



 

4  extent otherwise required by applicable law, in each case in their
reasonable discretion and without the Companys consent. Purchaser shall
not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date (as the same
may be extended or required to be extended) without the written consent of the
Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1. 



(c) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and
Purchaser shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
"), pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ "),
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together
with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ").
The Schedule TO shall include the summary term sheet required under Regulation
M-A and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with any
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and
Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to
be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law. Parent and
Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall
give due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and
Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser
or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of
such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written
responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or
this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer,
Parent and Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository or
paying agent, including the Paying Agent, acting on behalf of Parent
and Purchaser, to return all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.



Section 1.2 _Company Actions_. (a) As soon as practicable following the filing
of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2 and
Section 5.3, contain the recommendation referred to in clause (iii) of Section
3.4; _provided_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC contemporaneously with the filing of the
Schedule TO. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws.  



 

5  The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand,
agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law.
The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before
it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written
or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.



(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings
and any available listing or computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information
and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the
Shares, updated promptly from time to time upon Purchasers request, and their
addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Purchaser or its
agent may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of the Shares. Except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall promptly deliver to the Company all copies of such
information.



Section 1.3 _Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for any
Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer which represent at least a majority
of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis and at all times
thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of
Directors as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on
the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or
designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser
and any of its affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request at any time following
the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, use its best
efforts to take such actions, including but not limited to promptly filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board of Directors,
promptly increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors (including by
amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to increase the size of
the Company Board of Directors) and/or promptly securing the resignations of
such number of its incumbent directors as are necessary to enable Purchasers
designees to be so elected or designated to the Company  



 

6  Board of Directors, and shall use its best efforts to cause Purchasers
designees to be so elected or designated at such time. The Company shall,
upon Purchasers request following the purchase of and payment for Shares
pursuant to the Offer, also use its best efforts to cause Persons elected or
designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the
next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of each committee
of the Company Board of Directors to the extent permitted by applicable law
and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "). The Companys
obligations under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant
to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to shareholders (together with the
Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is
necessary to enable Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with, and be
solely responsible for, information with respect to Purchasers designees and
Parents and Purchasers respective officers, directors and affiliates to the
extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this
Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of
Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective affiliates may have as a holder
or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise.



(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Board of Directors to maintain as directors the Companys
current chief executive officer and three (3) other directors who are members
of the Company Board of Directors on the date hereof, each of whom, other than
the Companys chief executive officer, shall be an "independent director" as
defined by Rule 303A.02 of the NYSE rules and eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules, at least one
of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item
401(h) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto and at least two (2) of
whom shall be eligible to serve on the Companys Management Development and
Compensation Committee under the terms of the Company Stock Plans and under
the Exchange Act and NYSE rules (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death,
disability or resignation, the remaining Continuing Director(s) shall be
entitled to elect or designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such
vacancy in conformity with the requirements of this sentence, and such Person
(or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three (3) Persons to fill such vacancies (all of whom shall meet the
"independence" requirements of the preceding sentence and at least one of whom
shall meet the other requirements of the preceding sentence) and such Persons
shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchasers
designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors after the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and prior to the
Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the Company Board of
Directors or the shareholders of the Company as may be required by the
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (as amended, the " _Company
Articles_ "), the bylaws of the Company (as amended, the " _Company Bylaws_ ",
and together with the Company Articles, the " _Company_  



 

7   _Governing Documents_ ") or applicable law) be required (i) for the Company
to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would
materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Purchaser), (iii) to amend the Company Governing Documents if such
action would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other
than Parent or Purchaser) or (iv) to take any other action of the Company
Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if such action
would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than
Parent or Purchaser); _provided_ , _however_ , that if there shall be no
Continuing Directors as a result of such Persons deaths, disabilities or
refusal to serve, then such actions may be effected by majority vote of the
entire Company Board of Directors (or, to the extent permitted by the GBCC, by
a committee duly constituted by the Company Board of Directors).
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prevent Purchaser, its designees to the Company Board of
Directors or the Company from taking any action necessary to elect to be
treated as a "controlled company" as defined by NYSE Rule 303A and making
all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, after the
acceptance of Shares pursuant to the Offer until the Effective Time, the
members of the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the
Company Board of Directors who are Continuing Directors shall have the sole
power and authority to interpret the Company Stock Plans.

date for, call and give notice of a special meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of considering and taking action upon
this Agreement (with the record date and meeting date set in consultation
with Purchaser and it being acknowledged that (x) the record date shall be set
for a time subsequent to the time that the Purchaser becomes the record holder
of the Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and the Top-Up Option, if
applicable, and (y) the Company may set the record date prior to the date it
calls and gives notice to its shareholders of the Special Meeting) and (B)

ARTICLE II.



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES



Section 2.1  _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):



(a) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.80 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent,
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon.



Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company to act as
agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") and to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the
aggregate Merger Consideration. Such funds shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation pending
payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares; _provided_
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by  



 

11  Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers
acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital,
surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $500 million (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly
available at the SEC or otherwise). Earnings from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Corporation, and no part of
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without
interest thereon.



(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following one year after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or
for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents
routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger  



 

12  Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the relevant Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and such amounts shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable
law by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be.



Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and
who complies in all respects with, Article 13 of the GBCC (the " _Dissenters
Provisions_ ") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Provisions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters Provisions,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration.



(b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands received
by the Company for dissenters rights of any Shares, and Purchaser shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.



Section 2.4 _Top-Up Option_. (a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an
irrevocable option, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated
pursuant to the provisions hereof (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), to purchase that
number of shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser and/or any other Subsidiary
of Parent at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one (1) share more
than 90% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, on a fully diluted
basis, at a price per share payable in cash equal to the Offer Price;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable,
unless immediately after such exercise the Purchaser would own more than
ninety percent (90%) of the Common Stock then outstanding.  



 

13 (b) Subject to no statute, rule or regulation having been enacted or
promulgated by any Governmental Entity which prohibits the consummation of
the Merger and there being no order or injunction of a court of competent
jurisdiction in effect preventing consummation of the Top-Up Option or the
Merger, the Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in
part, at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event and
prior to the earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the date which
is fifteen (15) business days after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise
Event. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Top-Up Exercise Event_ " shall
occur if (i) Purchaser shall have accepted Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer and (ii) the issuance of Shares pursuant the Top-Up Option would not
require shareholder approval under NYSE Rule 312.03.



(c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ,"
the date of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_
") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing
the Top-Up Option Shares which the Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place,
time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-
Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "), which date may not be more than five
(5) business days, after the Top-Up Notice Date. The Company shall, promptly
after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to
the Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate
purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up
Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be
paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, (i) by wire transfer of same day funds to
a bank account designated by the Company in the Top-Up Notice Receipt in the
amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt or (ii) by
delivery of a promissory note on market terms in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Continuing Directors and guaranteed by Parent,
in the principal amount equal to the amount specified in the Top-Up Notice
Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate
or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares.



(d) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and for so long as this
Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, the
Company agrees that it shall at all times maintain, free from
preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of
Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement so that the Top-Up Option may
be exercised without additional authorization of shares of Common Stock, after
giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and
other rights to purchase shares of Common Stock.



Section 2.5 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and other Equity Awards_.
(a) Upon the consummation of the Offer each option to purchase Shares ("
_Company Options_ "), stock appreciation right (" _SAR_ ") whether settled in
cash or Shares, and Shares subject to restrictions and forfeiture ("
_Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will by its
terms and with no action of the Company, be fully vested. In addition, upon
consummation of the Offer each performance award or unit (" _Performance
Award_ "), and each other deferred right to receive in the future Shares or
cash measured in reference to Shares  



 

14  (" _Deferred Stock_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Rights_ "), will by its terms and with no
action of the Company, vest and the maximum amount of Shares or cash
deliverable thereunder will be delivered as provided in the Company Stock
Plans pertaining thereto.



(b) Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.5 and the vesting of
Restricted Stock shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes.

to carry on its business as now being conducted, except for those

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to or
made available to Parent and Purchaser prior to the execution of this
Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to the Company Governing
Documents not filed as of the date hereof with the SEC. The Company is in

such Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and

be, and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on

violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation

Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

supplied by Parent or Purchaser in writing expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) will, at the date mailed to shareholders or at the time

consummate all the Transactions, including acquiring all the outstanding
Shares in the Offer and the Merger.

each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is valid and in
full force and effect. As of the date hereof, to Parents knowledge no event

fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid as of the date hereof.
As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or

the financing required for the consummation of the Transactions and the
payments of all fees and expenses incurred by Parent in connection therewith.

requested by the other party hereto, to mitigate any adverse effect upon the

and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, cooperate
and use their best efforts to contest and resist, except insofar as the

proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary

restrict consummation of the Transactions.



(e) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent or Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the
consummation of the Offer. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, control and supervision over its business operations.



(f) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, if necessary to
obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,

Regulation, the antitrust, merger control, competition, foreign investment or
similar laws of Canada or Turkey or any such other applicable laws, each of

assets, or agreeing to, or permitting, any of the foregoing with respect to
such assets); and (2) the Company shall take any and all actions with respect
to its assets or the assets of any of the Company Subsidiaries (including
selling holding separate, licensing or otherwise disposing of such assets, or
agreeing to, or permitting, any of the foregoing with respect to such assets)
subject to (but so as to facilitate) consummation of the Offer; _provided_ ,
that, in every case, the obligation to take any such action shall be
conditioned upon the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer.
Each of the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to cause the waiting
period under the HSR Act to expire or be terminated, and to otherwise obtain
all regulatory approvals in connection with the EC Merger Regulation, and the
antitrust, merger control competition, foreign investment or similar laws of
Canada, Turkey or any such other applicable laws, as promptly as possible
after the execution of this Agreement.



Section 6.5 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective controlled affiliates, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent
of the other party, except as such party reasonably concludes,
after receiving the advice of outside counsel, is required by applicable law
or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities
exchange or trading market, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a
basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity
to the other parties to review and comment upon such press release or other
announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto. 



 

44 Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. (a)
The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
individuals who served as officers or directors of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries at any time at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _Covered
Persons_ ") as provided by the terms of the Company Articles or Company
Bylaws in effect on the date hereof and under any agreements (the "
_Indemnification Agreements_ ") as in effect on the date hereof (true and
correct copies of which previously have been provided to Parent) against any
liabilities and expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements, and
amounts of judgments, fines or penalties against, or amounts paid in
settlement by, any Covered Person) incurred by such Covered Persons arising
out of or relating to actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not asserted prior to the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the adoption and approval of
this Agreement and the Transactions and the consummation of the
Transactions), to the full extent permissible under applicable provisions of
the GBCC.



(b) The Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.6(a) pursuant to the procedures set
forth, and to the extent provided in the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws
or the Indemnification Agreements as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that any Person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the
extent required by the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws or the GBCC, to
repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Person
is not entitled to indemnification.



(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including the
Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Governing
Documents. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons in existence on
the date of this Agreement that survive the Merger shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.



(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain and extend all
existing officers and directors liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_")
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time with
respect to claims arising in whole or in part from facts or events that
actually or allegedly occurred on or before the Effective Date, including in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage
and amounts containing terms no less favorable to the Covered Persons than
the existing DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the existing DandO
Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period through no
fault or the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
substantially similar DandO Insurance; _provided further_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate premiums
for insurance under this Section 6.6(d) in excess of 300% of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company in 2004 for such purpose (the " _Base Premium_
"), the true and correct amount of which is set forth in Section 6.6(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by
this Section 6.6(d) for such aggregate premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall  



 

45  obtain as much insurance as can be obtained for aggregate premiums not in
excess of 300% of the Base Premium. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may elect to obtain prepaid policies prior to the
Effective Time, which policies provide the Covered Persons with DandO Insurance
coverage of equivalent amount and on at least as favorable terms as that
provided by the Companys current DandO Insurance for an aggregate period of at
least six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including,
without limitation, in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder.



(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this Section 6.6.



(f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6, and this Section 6.6 shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their
successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.



Section 6.7 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair
price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations enacted under state or
federal laws become or are deemed to become applicable to the Company, the
Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Top-Up Option or
the Merger, then the Company Board of Directors shall use its reasonable best
efforts to render such statute irrevocably inapplicable to the foregoing.



Section 6.8 _Certain Tax Matters_. During the period from the date hereof to
the Effective Time, the Company shall and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to: (i) prepare and file all Tax Returns (" _Post Signing
Returns_ ") required to be filed by the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as
the case may be, by the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions)
in a manner consistent with past practice, except to the extent otherwise
required by law, (ii) timely pay all Taxes shown to be due and payable by the
Company and such Company Subsidiary on such Post-Signing Returns,
respectively, and (iii) promptly notify Parent of any written notice of any
suit, claim, action, investigation, audit or proceeding pending against or
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in respect of
any material Tax matters (or any significant developments with respect to
ongoing suits, claims, actions, investigations, audits or proceedings in
respect of such material Tax matters).



Section 6.9 _Notes Tender Offers_. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company will, or
will cause the applicable issuer to, on the date of commencement of the Offer,
commence (i) a tender offer (the " _G-P 8.875% Notes Tender Offer_ ") for any

each holder of a particular series of Notes pursuant to each of the Notes
Tender Offers shall be an amount in cash established or calculated pursuant to

consideration from time to time as Parent may request. Each Notes Tender Offer
shall be made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation

that the request by Purchaser for the waiver of any condition necessary to

would result in an economic benefit to Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall
be reasonable).



(j) The Company shall prepare, as promptly as practicable, the Notes Offers
to Purchase, together with related letters of transmittal and similar
ancillary agreements (such documents, together with all supplements and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the " _Notes
Tender Offers Documents_ "), relating to the Notes Tender Offers and
disseminate to the record holders of the Notes, and to the extent known by the
Company, the beneficial owners of the Notes, the relevant Notes Tender
Offer Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the dissemination
thereof, the Company shall consult with Purchaser with respect to the Notes
Tender Offer Documents and shall afford Purchaser reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon and the Notes Tender Offer Documents shall be in such form as
Purchaser shall approve. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company with
any information for inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer Documents which may be
required under applicable law and which is reasonably requested by the
Company. If at any time prior to the acceptance of Notes pursuant to a Notes
Tender Offer any event should occur that is required by applicable law to be
set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Notes Tender Offer
Documents, (including any change in the terms of or consideration to be paid
pursuant to, the terms of any Notes Tender Offer) the Company will, as
promptly as practicable, prepare and disseminate such amendment or
supplement;  _provided __,_ _however_ , that prior to such dissemination, the
Company shall consult with Purchaser with respect to such amendment or
supplement and shall afford Purchaser reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Purchaser and its
counsel, and such supplement shall be in such form as Purchaser shall approve.
The Company represents and  



 

49  warrants to Purchaser that the Notes Tender Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; _provided_ , that the Company makes no representation with
respect to factual information provided by Parent or Purchaser for inclusion
in the Notes Tender Offer Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6.9, the Company shall not be required to take any action
inconsistent with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act or
any other applicable law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection
with the Notes Tender Offers. The Company will notify Purchaser at least
forty-eight (48) hours prior to the dissemination of Notes Tender Offer
Documents, or twenty-four (24) hours prior to the mailing of any amendment or
supplement thereto, to Noteholders. The Company shall, and shall cause the
relevant Company Subsidiaries, to take all reasonable actions
necessary, desirable or appropriate, in consultation with Parent, to
effectuate the Notes Tender Offers as contemplated by this Agreement,
including entering into one or more dealer manager agreements, with a dealer
manager selected by Purchaser, relating to the Notes Tender Offers and
causing its and their Representatives, including outside legal counsel, to
provide customary opinions in connection therewith.



(k) At such time as the Company receives consents from Noteholders holding at
least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant series
of Notes, the Company agrees to execute, and to cause all of the guarantors
that are a party to the relevant Notes Indentures to execute, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under the relevant Notes
Indenture to execute, a supplemental indenture (a " _Supplemental Indenture_
") in order to give effect to the amendments of the relevant Notes Indenture
contemplated in the relevant Notes Tender Offer Documents; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the fact that a Supplemental Indenture will
become effective upon such execution, the proposed amendments set forth
therein (the " _Proposed Amendments_ ") will not become operative (other than
with respect to the change of control waiver) unless and until all conditions
to the relevant Notes Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived by the
Company and the Company accepts all Notes (and related consents) validly
tendered for purchase and payment pursuant to the relevant Notes Tender
Offer. In such event, the parties hereto agree that the Proposed Amendments
with respect to a particular Notes Indenture will be deemed operative as of
immediately prior to such acceptance for payment, and the Company
will thereafter be obligated to make all payments for, the relevant Notes
(and related consents) so tendered.



(l) If the Effective Time does not occur, Purchaser shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary
or other agent retained in connection with the Notes Tender Offers each of
whom shall be selected by Purchaser, and Purchaser further agrees to reimburse
the Company for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with
the Notes Tender Offers promptly following incurrence and delivery of
reasonable documentation of such costs. If the Effective Time does not occur,
Parent and Purchaser shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, their respective officers and
directors and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning
of Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Notes Tender
Offers and the Notes Tender Offer Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor Purchaser shall have any  



 

50  obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or Person to the
extent that any such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred
arises from disclosure regarding the Company that is determined to have
contained a material misstatement or omission.



Section 6.10 _Domestic Reinvestment Plan_. The Company shall, no later than
the earlier of the business day immediately prior to the date on which the
Offer expires and December 30, 2005, cause to be paid in cash the Gross §965
Dividend as defined and more fully described in the Companys Domestic
Reinvestment Plan dated as of September 7, 2005.



Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) The Surviving Corporation
shall, for the period immediately following the Effective Time through and
including the first anniversary of the Effective Time, use good faith efforts
to provide employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ ") with base salary, employee benefits
and incentive compensation (excluding equity compensation) opportunities that
are in the aggregate substantially equivalent in value to the current
benefits provided by the Company (other than with respect to change of control
payments or other payments resulting from the Offer or the Merger) to the
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing herein shall
be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Employee or prohibit or
restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation to (i) modify salaries and
incentive compensation in a manner that is reasonably related to an individual
Employees job performance after the Effective Time or to any change in the
scope of an individual Employees responsibilities after the Effective Time;
(ii) make changes to an individual Employees employment status or
compensation to the extent necessary to reflect changes in employment or
market conditions; (iii) make changes to salaries, employee benefits and
incentive compensation pursuant to negotiations in connection with a Company
Collective Bargaining Agreement or (iv) amend and/or eliminate any benefit
program, subject to compliance with the first sentence of this Section
6.11(a).



(b) The Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and
eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Parent (to the extent an Employee is
brought under any such plan), the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Benefit Plans
and Foreign Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any such benefit.



(c) To the extent that, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation changes the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements in
which Employees participate, Parent shall (i) waive, or use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as
to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to each Employee to the same extent
waived under a comparable Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan, and (ii) with respect
to the Plan Year in which the change was made, provide a credit to each
Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
such Employee under the Benefit Plans or Foreign Plans during the relevant
plan year, up to and including the Effective Time.



 

51 Section 6.12 _Obligations of Parent and Purchaser_. Until the Effective Time,
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that during such five (5) business day or
two (2) business day period (as applicable), the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable

with such termination pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 8.2; and _provided further_ , that Parent and Purchaser acknowledge
and agree that concurrently with such termination the Company may enter into a
definitive agreement providing for implementation of such Superior Proposal.

nothing herein (except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2(h)) shall relieve
any party from liability for any willful or intentional material breach of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall relieve

56  Purchaser fails to consummate (A) the Offer in accordance with the terms,
and subject to the conditions, of this Agreement or (B) the Merger
in accordance with the terms, and subject to the conditions, of this
Agreement.



(b) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(ii), Section 8.1(c)(iii) or Section 8.1(d) or the Company shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii) and if, in any such
case, (x) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
received by the Company or publicly announced and (y) concurrently with, or
within twelve (12) months following such termination, a Third Party
Acquisition Event (or, a series of related or unrelated transactions (even if
none would itself constitute a Third Party Acquisition Event) that, when

the Company shall pay to Parent promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
business days after the date of such Third Party Acquisition Event, a
termination fee of $370 million ($370,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ ")
_less_ the amount of any Parent Expenses (as hereinafter defined) previously
paid pursuant to Section 8.2(d), if any; _provided_ , that in the case of a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), Section 8.1(d)
or Section 8.1(e)(ii) the Termination Fee shall be payable only if the Third
Party Acquisition Event that occurs within the relevant 12-month period
results, or would result, in holders of Shares receiving
aggregate consideration per Share with a value greater than or equal to
$48.00 (after subtracting the aggregate amount or value of any dividends or
distributions paid or made during such 12-month period (excluding the dividend
described in Section 5.1(c)(i)) and otherwise taking into account any stock
splits, dividends or adjustments) based, in the case of non-cash
consideration, on the average closing price of such consideration on the
primary market therefor for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding
the date of the agreement relating thereto (or, if there is no such agreement,
the date of consummation thereof) or, if such consideration does not so trade,
the fair market value thereof on the date of the agreement relating thereto
(or, if there is no such agreement, the date of consummation thereof (it being
understood that, in the case of a series of transactions, such determination
shall be made with respect to each transaction as of the relevant date
described above). If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(iv), Section 8.1(c)(i), or Section 8.1(c)(ii), the Company
shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee promptly, but in no event later than
two (2) business days after the date of such termination.



(c) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), the
Company shall pay to Parent concurrently the Termination Fee.



(d) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii),
Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(c)(iii), the Company shall pay to Parent
promptly (and in no event later than two (2) business days after receipt of a
statement therefor) an amount equal to Parent and Purchasers reasonable
documented out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement (including due diligence), compliance
with the obligations of Parent and Purchaser hereunder and actions taken in
furtherance of the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby, not
to exceed $25 million in the aggregate (the " _Parent Expenses_ ").



(e) If the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(ii) or (so long as Parent could not at such time also terminate this
Agreement  



 

57  pursuant to Section 8.1) Section 8.1(e)(i), then, in addition to any other
remedies available to the Company under this Agreement, Parent shall pay to
the Company promptly (and in no event later than two (2) business days after
receipt of a statement therefor) an amount equal to the Companys reasonable
documented out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and actions taken in furtherance of
the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby not to exceed $25
million in the aggregate (the " _Company Expenses_ ").



(f) The Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses and the Company Expenses,
as applicable, shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the recipient thereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall (i) the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, (ii) the Companys aggregate
liability for Parent Expenses exceed $25 million (plus amounts described in
Section 8.2(g)(ii)) and (iii) Parents aggregate liability for Company
Expenses exceed $25 million (plus amounts described in Section 8.2(g)(i)).

shall withhold any withholding taxes on any payment under this Section 8.2.



(g) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2
are an integral part of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(i) if Parent fails to pay the Company Expenses when due and the Company
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent for the
Company Expenses, Parent shall pay the Company its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit or (ii) if the Company fails to pay the Termination
Fee and/or the Parent Expenses when due and Parent or Purchaser commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee
and/or the Parent Expenses, the Company shall pay Parent and Purchaser their
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit.



(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon payment
of the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c),
the Company shall not have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and the Companys payment
of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c) shall be
the exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser for any loss or damages suffered
as a result of the failure of any of the Transactions to be consummated.

hereunder.



Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the  



 

68  economic or legal substance of the Offer or the Merger is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to
the extent possible.



Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) Except as required by the
mandatory provisions of the GBCC, this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York,

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any

Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
Delaware State court or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, in
such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State
or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 9.4. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.



Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY IS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
OFFER AND MERGER CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.12.



 

69 Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign, in its
sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to Parent and
one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent or (iii) to
one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent (each,
an " _Assignee_ "); _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of its obligations hereunder and such assignment does not
result in any material delay in the consummation of the Transactions. Subject
to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party hereto of any
obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates shall have the right to collaterally
assign in whole or in part this Agreement and any ancillary agreements or
documents related to the Transactions and any of their respective rights
thereunder as security to one or more lenders or purchasers of debt securities
who, in each case, are being granted a collateral interest in this Agreement
or any ancillary agreements or documents related to the Transactions. 



Section 9.14 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.



 

70 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized
as of the date first written above.
