in the aggregate exceed $3,800,000, Acquirors liability shall be limited to
the amount of such excess) (it being understood that, for purposes of this
Section 2.01(d)(iv)(C), "income Tax" shall mean a currently payable Tax the
base of which is net income or gain);

(v) (A) any Liability to the extent arising out of or relating to the
employment of any present or former Energy Storage Business Employee (or
termination of employment of any such person) and (B) those Liabilities that
are expressly excluded pursuant to _Article VI_ ;

 

(vi) any Liability arising under the Microporous Purchase Agreement and any
related agreements;

 

(vii) any Environmental Liability to the extent arising out of the operation
or conduct of the Energy Storage Business or arising out of or relating to
any Excluded Asset or any property formerly owned, operated or used by the
Energy Storage Business, except to the extent arising out of the operation or
conduct of the Business or arising out of or relating to any Transferred
Asset;

(viii) any Liability arising out of or relating to (A) any of the Assumed
Contracts to the extent arising out of the operation or conduct of the Energy

Energy Storage Business or arising out of or relating to any Excluded Asset;
and

(ix) any Liability of Sellers or their respective Affiliates arising out of
or relating to the ownership or operation of the Energy Storage Business and

Section 2.02  _Assignment of Certain Transferred Assets_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to convey, assign, transfer
or deliver to the Acquiror any Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted conveyance,
assignment, transfer or delivery thereof, or an agreement to do any of the
foregoing, without the consent of a third party (including any Governmental
Authority), would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or a
violation of Law or would in any way adversely affect the rights of the
Acquiror (as assignee or transferee of the Sellers, or otherwise) thereto or
thereunder and, subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver by the party entitled to the benefit thereof) of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ , the Closing shall occur
notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price in
connection therewith. From the date hereof until the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consent necessary, and to take
such other reasonable actions

 



7  (including delivery of any notice or opinion of counsel) that may be
required, for the conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of any such
Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit to the Acquiror; provided, that no
Seller shall be required to pay any consideration or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) in connection therewith and any costs
or expenses associated therewith shall be borne solely by the
Acquiror, provided further, that in no event will the failure to obtain such
consent or take such other action prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. If, on the Closing Date, any such consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery
thereof or performance thereof by the Acquiror would be ineffective or a
violation of Law or would adversely affect the rights of the Acquiror thereto
or thereunder so that the Acquiror would not in fact receive all such rights,
the Sellers and the Acquiror will cooperate in a mutually acceptable
reasonable arrangement under which the Acquiror would, in compliance with Law
and all applicable contractual obligations, obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with such
Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit in accordance with this Agreement,
including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the Acquiror, or under
which the Sellers would enforce for the benefit (and at the expense) of the
Acquiror any and all of their rights against a third party (including any
Governmental Authority) associated with such Transferred Asset, claim, right
or benefit, and the Sellers would promptly pay to the Acquiror when received
all monies received by them under any such Transferred Asset, claim, right or
benefit.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Transferred Asset shall be
conveyed, assigned, transferred and delivered to the Acquiror upon receipt of
the requisite consent unless such attempted contribution, conveyance,
assignment, transfer or delivery thereof would be ineffective or a violation
of Law or would adversely affect the rights of the Acquiror.

Section 2.03 _Closing_. The sale and purchase of the Transferred Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall
take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") that will take place at the
offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York,
NY 10006 at 9:59 a.m., New York time, on the fifth Business Day following the
satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver by the
party entitled to the benefit thereof), but subject to the continued
satisfaction or waiver at the Closing, of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ (other than (i) the condition set forth in _Section 8.01(d)_ and (ii)
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but, in each of clauses (i) and (ii), subject to the satisfaction (or, in the
case of clause (ii), to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver by the
party entitled to the benefit thereof) of such conditions at the Closing), or
on such other date and at such other time and place as the parties may
mutually agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as
the "Closing Date". In no event will the Closing occur unless the Merger
is consummated immediately thereafter, and in no event will the consummation
of the Merger occur unless the Closing has occurred.

 

Section 2.04 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate "Purchase Price" for the
Transferred Assets shall be an amount in cash equal to $1,037,000,000.

 



8 Section 2.05 _Closing Deliveries by the Sellers_. At the Closing, the Company

(a) a receipt for the portion of the Purchase Price received by such Seller,
if any;

 

(b) duly executed counterparts to the Ancillary Agreements (to the extent not
otherwise specifically identified in this  _Section 2.05_);

(c) such other deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, consents, assignments and
other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and assignment as the
parties, Merger Buyer and their respective counsel, jointly, shall deem
reasonably necessary for the assumption by the Acquiror of the Assumed
Liabilities or, subject to _Section 2.02_, to vest in the Acquiror all of
such Sellers right, title and interest in, to and under the Transferred
Assets;

(d) a schedule reflecting the allocation of the Purchase Price among each of
the Sellers Affiliates and each of the Acquirors Affiliates designated as

pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, to the effect that such Seller

(f) an IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, from each Seller identified

9 (b) duly executed counterparts to the Ancillary Agreements (to the extent not
otherwise specifically identified in this _Section 2.05_);

(c) such other deeds, assumptions and other good and sufficient instruments
of conveyance and assumption as the parties, Merger Buyer and their
respective counsel, jointly, shall deem reasonably necessary for the
assumption by the Acquiror of the Assumed Liabilities or, subject to _Section
2.02_, to vest in the Acquiror all of the Sellers right, title and interest
in, to and under the Transferred Assets;

(d) the Real Property Sale and Transfer Agreement, duly executed by an
Acquiror in front of a German notary; and

(e) the Share Sale and Transfer Agreement, duly executed by an Acquiror in

Acquiror shall deduct from the Purchase Price and any payment hereunder any
amounts if and to the extent that any such amounts are required to be withheld
and deducted under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted shall be
remitted by the Acquiror to the appropriate Governmental Authority on a timely
basis and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Seller in respect of which such deduction was made; provided,
however, that in the event any amounts are withheld from any payment as a
result of the Acquiror designating an entity pursuant to _Section 10.13_ to
acquire Transferred Assets that is organized or resident in a jurisdiction
other than the jurisdiction in which such Transferred Assets are located, the
Acquiror shall pay such additional amounts (" _Additional Amounts_ ") as may

would have received had there been no such withholding; and provided,
further, that the Acquiror shall provide a schedule to the Sellers, no later
than ten (10) days prior to Closing, setting forth any amounts that are to be
withheld and the parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to) use reasonable best efforts to avoid or mitigate any withholding. Whenever
any payment under this Agreement shall be due on a day other than a Business
Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such
extension of time shall be included in the computation of, and payment of,
interest. The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
use a credit for withheld Taxes in respect of which the Acquiror pays
Additional Amounts, and shall promptly pay over to the Acquiror the amount of
any such credit that it actually uses.

and are being maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP.

 



13 (c) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries, with respect to the Business, has
any debt, liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether fixed,
contingent or absolute, accrued or not accrued, matured or unmatured, known or
unknown, determined or determinable, secured or unsecured, disputed or
undisputed, subordinated or unsubordinated, or otherwise and whether due or
to become due), except for those debts, liabilities and obligations (i)
reflected or reserved against in the Company SEC Reports, (ii) arising out of
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, (iii) under Business Contracts
existing as of the date hereof that are not required under GAAP to be
reflected or reserved against in such balance sheet, except to the extent that

a default under such Business Contract, (iv) incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice since September 27, 2014, or (v)

finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Company SEC Reports, in each case with respect to the Business.

a significant role in the Companys internal controls. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has substantially addressed any such deficiency, material
weakness or fraud. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no reason that the Companys outside auditors, chief executive

the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when required.

Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications were true and
correct on the date such certifications were made. For purposes of this
_Section 3.04(f)_ "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley

related to the Energy Storage Business (in the case of the Company and its
Affiliates) and any copies thereof in their possession for a period
consistent with such partys record retention policy (but for at least five
(5) years from the Closing Date). During such five (5) year or longer period,
Representatives of the Company, the Acquiror and their respective Affiliates
shall, upon reasonable notice and for any reasonable business purpose, have

hereto or their respective Affiliates shall reasonably request in connection
with any Action to which such other parties hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates are parties or in connection with the requirements of any Law
applicable to such other parties hereto or any of their
respective Affiliates. Upon the written request of the Acquiror any time
after five (5) years from the Closing Date, the Company or its Affiliates, as

38  Energy Storage Business that were transferred at Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.02(a)_ to the Acquiror or its designated Affiliate, following
which the Acquiror and its Affiliates shall no longer retain any books and
records related to the Energy Storage Business (as conducted by the Company
and its Affiliates prior to the Closing), including any copies thereof;
provided, _however_ , that the Acquiror and its Affiliates may retain such

Person and its Affiliates pursuant to  _Section 5.04_ shall continue to
apply in respect of such books and records for so long as all or any part of
such books and records are retained by such Person or its Affiliates. After
such five-year or longer period, before any party hereto or any of its

possession and are related to the Business (in the case of the Company and its
Affiliates) or are related to the Energy Storage Business (in the case of

incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect (and the confidentiality obligations thereunder shall be binding
upon the Acquiror and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
representatives as if parties thereto) until the Closing, at which time the

shall terminate. If, for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

(b) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, except as to "trade
secrets," as such term is defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (and
codifications thereof under United States Law and corresponding international
Law) Related to the Business (in the case of the Company) or primarily related
to the Energy Storage Business (in the case of the Acquiror) for which the
obligation of non-disclosure and non-use under this _Section 5.04(b)_ shall
not expire until they cease to be "trade secrets," as such term is defined in
the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (and codifications thereof under United States
Law and corresponding international Law), each of the Company and the Acquiror
shall, subject to the Intellectual Property License Agreement, hold, and shall
cause its Affiliates to hold, in strict confidence and not use, disclose
or release without the prior written consent of the Acquiror or the Company,
as applicable, any

 



39  and all non-public information (" _Confidential Information_ ") related to
the Business (in the case of the Company) or related to the Energy Storage
Business (in the case of the Acquiror); _provided_ , that each party may
disclose, or may permit disclosure of, any such Confidential Information (i)
to its Representatives who have a need to know such information and are
informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the
same extent as is applicable to the parties hereto and in respect of whose
failure to comply with such obligations, such party shall be responsible, (ii)
to its Affiliates and Service Provider Parties (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement) and its and their respective Representatives as is
reasonably required in connection with and for the sole purpose of the
exercise of such partys rights and obligations under any Transaction
Agreement or (iii) if such party, any Service Provider Party (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement) or any of their respective Affiliates or
one of their Representatives is compelled (whether by deposition,
interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand,
order or other legal process) or otherwise required by Law to disclose any
such Confidential Information related to the Business or the Energy Storage
Business, as applicable; provided, further, that each party may use, or may
permit use of, any such Confidential Information as is reasonably required in
connection with and for the sole purpose of the exercise of such partys
rights and obligations under any Transaction Agreement, but each party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to disclose any Confidential
Information related to the Business (in the case of the Company) or the Energy
Storage Business (in the case of the Acquiror) to any personnel or employees
of such party, or its Affiliates or Representatives who engage in any
business of such party that competes with the Business (in the case of the
Company) or the Energy Storage Business (in the case of the Acquiror). In the
event that any demand or request for disclosure of any such Confidential
Information is made pursuant to clause (iii) above, the party receiving such
demand or request shall (x) as promptly as practicable notify the other party
of the existence of such request or demand to the extent practicable and, if
not otherwise prevented by Law, the disclosure that is expected to be made in
respect thereto so that the other party may, at its expense, seek a protective
order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment
will afforded to such Confidential Information and/or waive compliance with
the provisions of this _Section 5.04(b)_, and (y) if requested by the other
party, cooperate with the other party (at the other partys expense) in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate assurance that confidential
treatment will be afforded to such Confidential Information in respect of
which such request or demand was made. If such a protective order or other
remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the other party is not obtained and the
party, any of its Affiliates, any of its Service Provider Parties or any of
their respective Representatives is required by such Law to disclose any such
Confidential Information, such party (or its applicable Affiliate, Service
Provider Party or Representative) may disclose only that portion of the
Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed. With respect to
any Representative of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates that, prior to
the Closing, was a Representative of any of the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates, nothing in this _Section 5.04_ shall vitiate such
Representatives confidentiality obligations owed to such Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than with respect to Confidential Information related
to the Business) as a consequence of such Representatives former employment
with such Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Confidential
Information does not include any information which (i) is generally available
to and known by the public (other than as a result of a disclosure by the
Company or its Affiliates, in the case of

 



40  information related to the Business, or by the Acquiror or its Affiliates,
in the case of information related to the Energy Storage business), (ii)
becomes available after the Closing Date to the Company or any of its
Affiliates (in the case of information related to the Business) or the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (in the case of information related to the
Energy Storage Business) on a non-confidential basis from a source which is
not subject to any contractual or other obligation of confidentiality to the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (in the case of information related to the
Business) or the Company or any of its Affiliates (in the case of information
related to the Energy Storage Business), or (iii) is independently developed
by the Company or any of its Affiliates (in the case of information related to
the Business) or the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (in the case of
information related to the Energy Storage Business), as established through
documentary evidence, without violation of such partys covenants and
agreements hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
prevent the Company and its Affiliates from disclosing or using information
that is not related to the Business (as conducted by the Company and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing) or is used or held for use in respect of any
Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, and nothing herein shall prevent the
Acquiror and its Affiliates from disclosing or using information that is not
related to the Energy Storage Business or is used or held for use in respect
of any Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability.

 

Section 5.05 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Antitrust Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company
and the Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, on or prior to the Termination Date, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
each of the Company and the Acquiror shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to
cause the conditions set forth _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ (in the
case of the Company) and _Section 8.03_ (in the case of the Acquiror) to be
satisfied prior to the Termination Date, (ii) prepare and file as promptly as
reasonably practicable the submissions under all Antitrust Laws required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and,
if requested, to promptly amend or furnish additional information thereunder,
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, clearances, consents, permits and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and make all necessary registrations, notifications
and filings and take of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental
Authority prior to the Termination Date, and (iv) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the receipt thereof, respond to (or properly reduce the
scope of) any formal or informal request for additional information
or documentary material received by the Company, the Acquiror or any of their
respective Affiliates from any Governmental Authority. The Company and the
Acquiror shall, subject to applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to (x)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence and (y) supply the other
with any information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate
the taking of such actions. Each party hereto shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of
any communication to or from any Governmental Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. If the Company, the
Acquiror or any of their Affiliates receives a request for additional
information or documentary

 



41  material from any Governmental Authority with respect to transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, then it shall use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law and by any
applicable Governmental Authority, provide the other partys counsel with
advance notice and the opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing made thereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.
To the extent reasonably practicable and subject to the provisions _Section
5.02_, legal counsel for the Acquiror and for the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to the Acquiror or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements ( _provided_ that these materials may be redacted to the extent
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege, or other
confidentiality concerns; _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the information so redacted to be provided in
a manner that would not reasonably be expected to result in any waiver or
loss of such privilege, including by entering into a common interest or joint
defense agreement). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company
and the Acquiror shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, and the parties hereto shall comply
with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of
their respective obligations thereunder. Neither the Company nor the Acquiror
shall commit to or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries to commit to
or agree) with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under any applicable Antitrust Laws, without the
prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 

(b) In furtherance, and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Acquiror and their respective Affiliates agrees to cooperate with
each other and use reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any,
as may be asserted by the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state
antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other
nation or other jurisdiction or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction with respect to the transactions provided for in this Agreement
under Antitrust Laws, to permit the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements to be consummated in the most expeditious manner
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates will be required by this  _Section 5.05_ to (i) take any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other
arrangements, that (a) requires the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of any of Acquiror or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (b) limits Acquirors
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
Transferred Assets; or (ii) to defend, oppose, contest or resist any
litigation or adjudicative legal or similar proceedings relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements.

 

(c) The parties shall work cooperatively together on all communications and
strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws and litigation matters (provided that
each party acts in

 



42  good faith and is not constrained from complying with applicable Law),
subject to consultations with one another and the inclusion of the other party
at meetings with Governmental Authorities involving substantive issues under
the Antitrust Laws, unless the inclusion of one party is reasonably determined
after good faith consultation by both parties to be strategically detrimental
to the ultimate goal of obtaining clearance of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements under the Antitrust Laws.

such agreement to the extent required to permit the submission of a Competing
Proposal to the Company Board on a confidential basis if the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such amendment be
conditioned upon the applicable counterparty agreeing that the Company shall
not be prohibited from providing any information to Acquiror (including

provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its controlled

becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall reimburse or agree to reimburse the
expenses of any third party in connection with any Competing Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer which could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.14(a)_, if at
any time following the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, (i) the Company receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Competing
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor, constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (ii) such
Competing Proposal did not result from a material breach of this _Section
5.14_, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor, that the
failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and (iv) before taking the actions described in clause (A) below, the Company
receives from the Person making such Competing Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms at least as favorable to the Company as
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall not be required to restrict the submission of
a Competing Proposal to the Company Board on a confidential basis), the
Company may (A) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such
Competing Proposal, if, to the extent not previously furnished, the
Company contemporaneously furnishes such information to Acquiror and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person (and its
Representatives) making such Competing Proposal with respect to such Competing
Proposal. The Company shall promptly notify Acquiror (within no more than 48
hours) of the communication or receipt of any Competing Proposal, indicating,
in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making such
Competing Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company
shall keep Acquiror reasonably informed on a current basis (within no more
than 48 hours) as to the status of (including any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding) any such Competing Proposal (including
whether such Competing Proposal or request has been withdrawn or rejected and
any material change to the terms thereof). The Company agrees that it and its
controlled Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with any Person
which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Acquiror in
accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.14_.

 

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
9.01_, except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.14(e)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) change, withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify
or modify, in any manner, the Board Recommendation (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "), (ii) approve or recommend or resolve to or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal or (iii) authorize,
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition or other agreement or understanding relating to, or
that is intended or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by _Section
5.14(c)_) or resolve, propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



50 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) there
shall occur any material event that (A) is not related to a Competing
Proposal, and (B) was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company
Board as of the date of this Agreement but became known to the Company Board
prior to the Stockholder Approval (any such material event, an " _Intervening
Event_ ") and (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then prior to the
receipt of the Stockholder Approval the Company Board may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 5.14_, effect a Change of Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to so effecting a Change of
Recommendation, (x) the Company shall have provided to Acquiror at least five
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall include, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and a
summary of all material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Intervening Event, (y) the Company shall have negotiated, and directed
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Acquiror and its
Representatives during such notice period (to the extent Acquiror desires to
negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Acquiror such that the failure of the Company Board to effect
such Change of Recommendation, in the Boards good faith determination, would
no longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(z) upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith all revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
in writing by Acquiror and shall have determined, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor, that the failure to
effect such Change of Recommendation would nevertheless continue to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor, that a bona fide,
unsolicited written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that did not
result from a breach of the Companys obligations under this  _Section 5.14_
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure of the Company Board to
approve, recommend or enter into a definitive agreement relating to such
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then at any time prior to the receipt of the
Stockholder Approval the Company Board may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.14(f)_, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section 9.01(g)_ in order to concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal upon (and subject to) paying
the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.02_; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that prior to so terminating the Agreement, (i) the Company shall
have provided to Acquiror at least five Business Days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "),
which notice shall include, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and any
information and materials required to be delivered under _Section 5.14(c)_
that have not yet been provided to Acquiror, (ii) the Company shall have
negotiated, and directed its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with
Acquiror and its Representatives during such notice period (to the extent
Acquiror desires to negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Acquiror such that such

 



51  Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (iii)
upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith all revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror and/or the Merger Buyer, and shall
have determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisor, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the proposed revisions were to
be given effect and that the failure of the Company Board to approve,
recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any change to the financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of a
Superior Proposal shall require the Company to deliver to Acquiror a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five Business Day notice period shall
commence thereafter.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable
Law; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of
Recommendation, unless permitted to do so by _Section 5.14(e)_, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any disclosure (other than a "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) made pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) shall be deemed to
be a Change of Recommendation, unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms in
such disclosure the Board Recommendation. The Company shall not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal prior to
the termination of this Agreement.

 

(h) The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this _Section 5.14_. Any material violation of the
restrictions contained in this _Section 5.14_ by any of its Representatives
shall be deemed to be a material breach of this _Section 5.14_ by the
Company.

the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of

or indirectly, (1) all or substantially all of the outstanding Company Common
Stock or (2) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent

applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.

or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by

limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

Section 5.18 _Payments Received_. The Company and its Affiliates each agree
that after the Closing they will hold and will promptly transfer and deliver

checks with appropriate endorsements (using commercially reasonable efforts
not to convert such checks into cash), or other property that they may
receive on or after the Closing which properly belongs to the Acquiror,
including without limitation any insurance proceeds, and will account to the
Acquiror for all such receipts. From and after the Closing, the Acquiror

the Sellers and their Affiliates under any surety bonds, letters of credit or
guarantees made or provided by the Sellers and their Affiliates (or any of
them) primarily for the benefit of the Business; provided, however, that
in no event will the failure to cause the Acquiror to be so

 



54  substituted prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to identify in writing
to the Acquiror, and to provide to the Acquiror relevant information and
documentation regarding, any such surety bonds, letters of credit or
guaranties. If the Acquiror is unable to effect any such substitution
after using its commercially reasonable efforts to do so, then the Acquiror
shall (a) obtain letters of credit, on terms and from financial institutions
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with respect to the obligations
covered by each of the surety bonds or letters of credit for which the
Acquiror does not effect such substitution in an amount equal to the amount of

best efforts, to the extent within its control (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, subject to the fourth sentence of this _Section 5.20(a)_), to do so
within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof. The Company
will respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC or the

efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as practicable. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement (or response to any comments thereon) will be made by the
Company, without obtaining Acquirors prior consent, which shall not be

notify Acquiror of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Acquiror with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.

the requirements of the Exchange Act. To the extent within its control, the
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement, at and from the date it is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company until the Company Stockholders
Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to the Company or Acquiror, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Acquiror
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Proxy
Statement, so that such document would not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company
shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

 



55 (c) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
the Proxy Statement is permitted by applicable Law to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders, take all actions necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of seeking
the Stockholder Approval (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Governing Documents of the Company; _provided_ that
the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting only (A) with the
written consent of Acquiror or (B) to allow time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and disseminated under
applicable Laws. In connection with the Stockholders Meeting, the Company
shall (i) unless there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 5.14(e)_, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder
Approval (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and ensuring that all proxies so solicited are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Laws and the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange) and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to
such meeting. The Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Board
Recommendation, unless there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with  _Section 5.14(e)_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall submit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
this Agreement for the approval of its stockholders at the Stockholder Meeting
whether or not a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred or a Competing
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise made known to the
Company, the Company Board, its Representatives or its stockholders and there
shall be no vote of the Companys stockholders in respect of any Competing
Proposal prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent
of Acquiror, the adoption of the Merger Agreement shall be the only matter
(other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be
voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption of this
Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders
of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting,  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company may, its sole discretion, combine the Stockholders Meeting with
its Annual Meeting of Stockholders and include the applicable matters thereto
among the matters to be voted on by the Companys stockholders at the
Stockholders Meeting if either (x) the Company is so required by applicable
Law or (y) the combination of the Stockholders Meeting with the Companys
Annual Meeting of Stockholders would not reasonably be expected to delay the
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this _Section
5.20_ shall prohibit the Company from holding its Annual Meeting of
Stockholders separate from the Stockholders Meeting.

 

Section 5.21 _Post-Closing Satisfaction of Closing Deliverables_. In the event
that any deliverables described in  _Section 2.05_ were not delivered by the
Company and/or the other Sellers at the Closing, or any deliverables described
in _Section 2.06_ were not delivered by the Acquiror at the Closing, the
Company and the Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate and use reasonable best
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, all such items not so delivered at the
Closing.

 

Section 5.22 _Closing of Financial Books and Records_. In the event that the
Closing occurs two (2) or more Business Days prior or subsequent to the last
day of a month, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing, close its financial books and records, consistent in all respects to
past practices and in accordance with GAAP, producing a balance sheet, income
statement and cash flow statement reflective of the Closing Date.

 



56 ARTICLE VI

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 6.01 _German Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer of Employment_. It is the parties understanding that the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement constitutes
with respect to the Business Employees who are employed in Germany and
currently working exclusively or predominantly for the Business in Germany
(including any Business Employee who is on a leave of absence for any reason
or any Business Employee on maternity or parental leave) (" _German Business
Employees_ ") a transfer of undertaking ( _Betriebs ubergang_) from the
Subsidiaries of the Company in Germany that employ German Business Employees
(the " _Sellers  German Entities_") to Acquiror within the meaning of
section 613a of the German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch or BGB_). As
a consequence, the employment relationships of the German Business
Employees will, by operation of law, transfer to Acquiror with effect as of
the Closing Date, unless any individual German Business Employee objects to
such transfer of his or her employment relationships in accordance with
section 613a para. 6 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

(b) _Notification of German Business Employees_. Sellers German Entities and
Acquiror shall jointly notify the German Business Employees without undue
delay, however no later than the Closing Date, about the transfer of their
employment relationships in text form pursuant to section 613a para. 5 of the
German Civil Code (BGB). In order to accomplish this, Sellers German
Entities shall provide to Acquiror within 15 days following the date hereof a
list of all German Business Employees including the name, employee number,
position or job title, principal place of employment and employing entity of
each such employee. Sellers German Entities and Acquiror shall agree upon the
wording of the notification. Each of Sellers German Entities and Acquiror
shall provide and make accessible to the other the information required
for the proper notification of the German Business Employees.

(c) _Objections to the Transfer of Employment_. Sellers German Entities will
recommend to the German Business Employees not to object to the transfer of
their employment relationship to Acquiror. Sellers German Entities and
Acquiror will promptly inform each other about any objection by a German
Business Employee against the transfer of his or her employment relationship
to Acquiror after receipt of such objection. If any German Business Employee
(an " _Objecting Employee_ ") objects to the transfer of his or her employment
relationship to Acquiror, whether during the objection period of one month
beginning on the date of delivery of the notification pursuant to _Section
6.01(b)_ (the " _Objection Period_ ") or after the expiration of the Objection
Period based on the fact that the information provided to him or her did not
meet the requirements of section 613a para. 5 of the German Civil Code (BGB),
Acquiror shall assume any and all Liabilities (including continued payment of
salary until an ordinary notice of termination becomes effective as well as
any reasonable severance, settlement or similar payments and related legal
fees, including reasonable attorneys fees, and including all 

 



57  pension liabilities and other liabilities) to the extent arising out of the
employment (from and after the Closing Date) or the termination of employment
of such Objecting Employee or, if required due to social selection criteria
under the German Act against Unlawful Dismissal ( _K undigungsschutzgesetz_),
another employee of Sellers German Entities who is not a German Business
Employee (any such Liabilities, " _Termination Costs_ "); provided that the
respective Sellers German Entity gives ordinary notice of termination to such
Objecting Employee or other employee of such Sellers German Entity, as
applicable, within a period of three months after having obtained the
objection of the Objecting Employee. Sellers German Entities will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such costs and liabilities to the
extent possible. In particular, prior to the termination of employment or the
conclusion of any termination agreement, court settlement, out-of-court
settlement agreement or similar agreement with any Objecting Employee or other
employee of Sellers German Entities, as applicable, the respective Sellers
German Entity will inform and consult with Acquiror regarding the Termination
Costs.

(d) _Long-Term Working Time Account_. The German Business Employees have
accrued claims under a long-term working time account within the meaning of
section 7b German Social Security Code _(Sozialgesetzbuch)_ , which are funded
by assets (" _Time Account Assets_ ") held by a trustee under a contractual
trust arrangement between Sellers German Entities and a third party as
trustee. Upon request of Acquiror and subject to the trustees consent,
Sellers German Entities shall take all commercially reasonable actions in
order to ensure that, effective as of the Closing Date, the Time Account
Assets can be held by the trustee as trustee under a contractual trust
arrangement for Acquiror (" _Continuation of CTA_ "). Sellers German
Entities shall timely provide Acquiror with all required documents and
agreements which are required for Continuation of CTA. In case Sellers German
Entities fail to ensure Continuation of CTA, Sellers German Entities shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the trustee transfers the
Time Account Assets to Acquiror or a third party to be determined by Acquiror.
If such transfer of Time Account Assets is, for whatever reason, not
possible, Sellers German Entities will transfer a cash amount equaling the
value of the Time Account Assets to Acquiror or a third party to be determined
by Acquiror.

 

(e) _Pensions_.

 

(1) Sellers German Entities are liable for pension benefit obligations to
current and former Business Employees and their beneficiaries (" _German
Pension Obligations_ "). During the period between the date hereof and the
Closing, Sellers German Entities will cooperate with Acquiror for the purpose
of enabling Acquirors assumption of the German Pension Obligations and will
provide to Acquiror or enable Acquiror to obtain, in each case to the extent
within Sellers German Entities control or possession, (x) complete and
accurate details of the underlying pension commitments ("Pension
Commitments"), including true and complete copies or details of each document,
resolution, action, practice or other matter which confers or describes an
actual, prospective or contingent right to benefits under each
Pension Commitment, (y) a complete and accurate list detailing each
beneficiary who is a member of, or has any rights to benefits under, a Pension
Commitment, and (z) complete and accurate details of the benefits payable or
prospectively or contingently payable under the Pension Commitments in
respect of its beneficiaries.

 



58 (2) Acquiror assumes all German Pension Obligations towards the German
Business Employees attributable to the service time prior to the Closing Date
by virtue of law in accordance with section 613a of the German Civil Code
(BGB) (" _Legally Required Assumed German Pension Obligations_ "). By virtue
of this Agreement, Acquiror also assumes all German Pension Obligations
towards the former Business Employees and those pensioners and beneficiaries
already receiving payment of their Pension Commitments (" _Contractually
Agreed Assumed German Pension Obligations_ ") (together, the Legally Required
Assumed German Pension Obligations and the Contractually Agreed Assumed German
Pension Obligations are hereafter referred to as the " _Assumed German Pension
Obligations_ ") and all Liabilities (including administrative cost) arising
out of or relating to such Contractually Agreed Assumed German Pension
Obligations. Where applicable, Sellers German Entities shall transfer to
Acquiror the Assumed Company Benefit Plan Assets attributable to the Assumed
German Pension Obligations. In particular, Sellers German Entities shall,
subject to the consent of the respective insurance provider, transfer to
Acquiror any direct insurance contract or any re-insurance contract
maintained for the current and former employees, pensioners and their
beneficiaries to whom Sellers German Entities owe German Pension Obligations.

 

(3) As far as the Assumed German Pension Obligations are covered by a support
fund _(Unterst utzungskasse)_, upon the request of Acquiror, Sellers German
Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Acquiror can
become a sponsoring employer _(Tr agerunternehmen)_ of the support fund after
the Closing Date and that the support fund will provide German Business
Employees with benefits in line with the support fund scheme (" _Continuation
of Membership_ "). Sellers German Entities shall prove Continuation of
Membership by rendering to Acquiror a respective declaration of consent of
the support fund. In case Sellers German Entities fail to ensure Continuation
of Membership, Sellers German Entities shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the support fund transfers the relevant portion of the
support funds assets attributable to the Assumed German Pension Obligations
under the support fund scheme prior to the Closing Date to Acquiror. If such
transfer is not possible, Sellers German Entities shall indemnify Acquiror
by a cash payment equaling the support fund assets attributable to the Assumed
German Pension Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, such cash payment will
only become payable to the extent the pension obligations under the support
fund scheme are funded and in the amount the support fund has actually accrued
assets (which cannot be transferred to Acquiror or a third party), but will
not become payable insofar as the pension obligations under the support fund
scheme are unfunded because the support fund has not accrued any assets. This
_Section 6.01(e)(3)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ , if the German Business
Employees memberships in the support fund are required for providing benefits
in line with the support fund scheme.

 



59 Section 6.02 _Employees in the U.S. and Other Countries_.

 

(a) Acquiror shall or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to extend to each
Business Employee who is not employed in Germany an offer of employment
effective as of the Closing Date. Each Business Employee who accepts the
Acquirors or one of its Subsidiaries offer of employment shall be referred
to herein as a "Transferred Employee". A Business Employee who is offered
employment pursuant to this _Section 6.02(a)_ and who performs work at his or
her principal place of work in the Business on the first Business Day
following the Closing Date shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement
to have accepted Acquirors or one of its Subsidiaries offer of employment.

(b) Acquiror shall cause each offer of employment to a Business Employee
pursuant to Section 6.02(a) to provide for (i) at least the same level of
hourly salary or base wages as provided to such Business Employee immediately
prior to the date such offer is delivered, and (ii) employee benefits
(including severance) that are the same as the employee benefits (including
severance) provided to similarly-situated newly-hired employees of the
Acquiror or the respective Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 6.02(b) shall be deemed to require the Acquiror or the
applicable Subsidiary to provide any equity-based incentive compensation,
participation in any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical or
welfare benefits to any Transferred Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall (A) prevent the amendment or
termination of any Assumed Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms,
or interfere with the right or obligation of Acquiror to make such changes as
are necessary to conform with applicable Law or (B) limit the right of
Acquiror or its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee at
any time.

 

(c) To the extent that a Transferred Employee commences to participate in an
employee benefit plan maintained by Acquiror, Acquiror shall cause such
employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Transferred
Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and
vesting and benefits (but not for purposes of participation in or benefit
accruals under any defined benefit plan or retiree welfare benefit plan)
under such employee benefit plan to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Closing Date under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee was a participant immediately
prior to the Closing Date or, if there is no such comparable benefit plan, to
the same extent such service was recognized under the defined contribution
plan maintained under Section 401(k) of the Code by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that (A) recognition of such service
shall not be required to the extent that the service of employees other than
Transferred Employees is not so recognized under such employee benefit plans
and (B) such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefits payable to the Transferred Employee with respect to the same period
of service; and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or vision plan
of Acquiror in which any Transferred Employee commences to participate, in
the plan year that includes the year in which such Transferred Employee
commences to participate, (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations
under such Acquiror plan to be waived with respect to such Transferred
Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied
under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated
immediately prior to such commencement of participation and (B) recognize any
medical or other health deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Transferred Employee in the year that includes the year in which such
Transferred Employee commences to participate for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such
health, dental or vision plan of Acquiror.

 



60 (d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Acquiror shall use good faith
efforts to cooperate and share information with each other for the purpose of
evaluating the feasibility of offering to Transferred Employees who
participated in the Companys 401(k) plan prior to the Closing Date the
opportunity to make rollover contributions of any outstanding participant
loans from such plan to Acquirors 401(k) plan.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall, and Acquiror shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect
as of the date hereof, each employment agreement and change in control
agreement with a Business Employee to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party.

(f) To the extent any bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other cash
incentive plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Bonus Amounts_ ")
with respect to a fiscal year completed prior to the Closing remain unpaid as
of the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause all such Bonus Amounts to be
calculated and paid in the ordinary course of business to the eligible
Transferred Employees.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, with respect to any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is not a Business Employee, this _Section 6.02_ shall not
impose any restriction or obligation on Acquiror, or its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) This _Section 6.02_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this  _Article VI_ , express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.02._

 

Section 6.03 _Excluded Employee Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither Acquiror nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall assume any Liabilities or become responsible for any (x)
equity compensation grants or awards made by the Company to any of its current
or former employees, or (y) obligations under any nonqualified deferred
compensation plans or arrangements maintained by the Company.

ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.01 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any sales Tax, use Tax, direct or indirect real property
transfer Tax, documentary stamp Tax, or similar Taxes (other than VAT) and
related fees (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") attributable to the sale or transfer of
the Transferred Assets or the Business (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, indirect real property transfer Taxes triggered with respect to
Transferred Assets as a result of the transactions set forth in the Merger
Agreement) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Company and fifty
percent (50%) by the Acquiror. The party required by Law to file a Tax Return
with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall timely prepare, with the other
parties

 



61  cooperation, and file such Tax Return and shall promptly pay such Transfer
Taxes. The non-filing party shall reimburse the filing party for the non-
filing partys share of such Transfer Taxes within five (5) days of a demand
for payment thereof (or, if later, at least three (3) days before such Tax is
due). The Acquiror and the Company agree to timely sign and deliver (or to
cause to be timely signed and delivered) such certificates or forms as may be
necessary or appropriate and otherwise to cooperate to establish any available
exemption from (or otherwise reduce) such Transfer Taxes.

 

Section 7.02 _Allocations of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Acquiror and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree to the allocation of the Purchase Price among each of the Sellers
Affiliates and each of the Acquirors Affiliates designated as Acquirors
pursuant to _Section 10.13_ prior to the Closing Date and such allocation
shall be set forth in writing and signed by the parties. Concurrently with
the allocation described in the previous sentence (and in any event within 45
days after the Closing) the Acquiror and the Company shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare a more
detailed allocation of the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code.

(b) In order to facilitate such attempt to agree on the Purchase Price
allocations, the Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit the Acquiror to obtain an
independent appraisal of the Transferred Assets prior to the Closing and the
Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) permit representatives of
the Acquiror to have reasonable access during ordinary business hours to the
Transferred Assets and the Companys and its Affiliates personnel in order to
perform such appraisal. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be
liable for the costs of obtaining such appraisal.

Section 7.03  _Tax Filings and Tax Allocation_.

(a) The Company shall timely prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file
(or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Assets
or the Business required to be filed after the Closing Date for or with
respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods, and the Company
shall timely pay (or cause to be paid) to the relevant Governmental Authority
all Taxes shown as due on all such Tax Returns. Each such Tax Return shall be
prepared and filed on a basis consistent with past practice unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Prior to the filing of any Tax Return for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, the Company shall deliver to the
Acquiror, for its review and comment, a reasonable period of time (such
reasonable period of time to be not less than thirty (30) days in the case
of an income Tax Return) prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into
account applicable extensions), a copy of any such Tax Return proposed to be
filed (excluding however, portions of any Tax Return that do not relate to the
Transferred Assets or Business), together with such other information as may
reasonably be requested by the Acquiror to facilitate its review of such Tax
Return. The Company shall accept the reasonable comments that the Acquiror may
have, provided that such comments are received by the Company a reasonable
period of time (such reasonable period of time to be not less than ten (10)
days in the case of an income Tax Return) in advance of the due date of such
Tax Return. The Acquiror shall reimburse the Company for Taxes reflected on
such return, to the extent that they are allocable to the Acquiror under this
Agreement, within five (5) days of a demand for payment thereof (or, if later,
at least three days before such Tax is due).

 



62 (b) Neither the Company nor its Affiliates shall file any amended Tax Returns
with respect to the Transferred Assets or Business with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period that could cause Acquiror or its
Affiliates to bear any additional Taxes pursuant to this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Acquiror (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Without the prior written
consent of the Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), neither the Company nor its Affiliates shall take
any action that could have the effect of increasing the liability of the
Acquiror or its Affiliates for Taxes with respect to the Transferred Assets or
the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be considered
unreasonable for Acquiror to withhold or condition the giving of its consent
to the filing of an amended Tax Return or other action to the extent an
amended item on such Tax Return would result in an increased liability of the
Acquiror for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement and provide a Tax benefit to
the Company or its Affiliates. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide to Acquiror, at Acquirors expense, such information as is
reasonably requested by Acquiror in order to enable Acquiror to exercise its
rights hereunder in an informed manner.

(c) Any amount paid between the parties pursuant to _Section 7.01_ or this 
_Section 7.03_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
all relevant Tax purposes.

Section 7.04  _VAT_.

(a) Absent a waiver to the contrary, the sale and transfer of the real
property of Membrana GmbH to Acquiror which is regulated by the Real Property
Transfer Agreement would be exempt from VAT. Membrana GmbH hereby
unconditionally waives the VAT exemption pursuant to section 4 no. 9 a) German
VAT Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ) and opts for VAT pursuant to section 9
German VAT Act. Consequently, the sale of the real property is subject to VAT.
According to section 13b para. (2) no. 3, (5) German VAT Act, it is the
Acquiror as recipient who owes the VAT. Membrana GmbH shall use reasonable
best efforts to provide without undue delay prior to Closing issue a proper
invoice compliant with all invoice requirements under German VAT law to
Acquiror for the Purchase Price attributable to the transferred real property
in which reference is also made to Acquirors tax liability, but which
pursuant to section 14a para. (5) German VAT Act does not state VAT
separately. The Company shall promptly correct any material failure of such
invoice to meet the requirements of the German VAT Act as is reasonably
identified by the Acquiror in writing within a reasonable period following the
Closing. For the purposes of clarification, the Parties hereby state that this
Agreement does not constitute an invoice within the meaning of section 14
para. (4) German VAT Act. Acquiror shall pay the VAT payable directly to the
tax authorities. The Acquiror confirms to act as an entrepreneur within the
meaning of section 2 German VAT Act when acquiring the real property in
Germany, to acquire the real property in Germany for its business activity (
_f ur sein Unternehmen_) and, not to be a small business ( _Kleinunternehmer_
) according to section 19 para. (1) German VAT Act.

 

(b) Absent a waiver to the contrary, the sale and transfer of shares with
respect to the minority equity interests set forth on _Schedule 2.01(a)(xiv)_
from Membrana GmbH

 



63  to Acquiror which is regulated by the Share Sale and Transfer Agreement
would be exempt from VAT. Membrana GmbH hereby unconditionally confirms that
it does not waive the VAT exemption. The sale and transfer of shares with
respect to the minority equity interests set forth on _Schedule 2.01(a)(xiv)_
shall be a VAT exempt turnover. Membrana GmbH shall without undue delay prior
to Closing issue a proper invoice compliant with all invoice requirements
under German VAT law to Acquiror which shows the Purchase Price attributable
to the transferred minority equity interests set forth on _Schedule
2.01(a)(xiv)_ as a net payment together with a statement that the VAT
exemption of section 4 no. 8 f) German VAT Act is applied. The Company shall
promptly correct any material failure of such invoice to meet the requirements
of the German VAT Act as is reasonably identified by the Acquiror in writing
within a reasonable period following the Closing.

(c) If the sale and transfer of German based Transferred Assets and the
assumption of liabilities of Membrana GmbH by Acquiror is outside the scope
of German VAT, such as intangible assets and rights of Membrana GmbH sold and
transferred to Acquiror being a non-German resident company, Membrana GmbH
shall without undue delay prior to Closing issue a proper invoice compliant
with all invoice requirements under German VAT law to Acquiror which shows the
Purchase Price attributable to the transferred German based Transferred Assets
(other than the assets transferred under _Section 7.04(a), (b) and (d)_)
which transfer is outside the scope of German VAT as a net payment and does
not state German VAT separately. The Company shall promptly correct any
material failure of such invoice to meet the requirements of the German VAT
Act as is reasonably identified by the Acquiror in writing within a
reasonable period following the Closing.

(d) Except as set forth in  _Section 7.04(a), (b) and (c)_ above, the sale
and transfer of German based Transferred Assets and the assumption of
liabilities of Membrana GmbH by Acquiror will be subject to German VAT. Except
as set forth in  _Section 7.04(b), _Membrana GmbH may, in its sole
discretion, opt for VAT in case of VAT exempt assets, such as receivables, in
case the German VAT Act provides for an election right with respect to such
assets. The parties assume that the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement does not constitute the transfer of a business as a going concern (
_Gesch aftsveraußerung im Ganzen_). In case the competent tax authority has
assessed a different position and qualify the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as a transfer of a business as a going concern ( _Gesch
aftsveraußerung im Ganzen_), Membrana GmbH shall issue corrected invoices and
shall apply for the respective reduction of VAT payable for this transaction
in its VAT returns and Acquiror shall apply for the respective reduction of
input VAT claimed for this transaction in its VAT returns. Acquiror shall have
a claim against Membrana GmbH for overpaid VAT that was not legally owed only
if and to the extent Membrana GmbH received the applied reduction of VAT
payable for this transaction by way of refund, credit, set-off or likewise.
All payments under this Agreement are net payments, and all German or foreign
VAT arising in connection with this Agreement or its implementation shall be
borne by Acquiror as an addition to the Purchase Price and paid to Membrana
GmbH contemporaneously with payments of the Purchase Price. Membrana GmbH
shall without undue delay prior to Closing issue a proper invoice compliant
with all invoice requirements under German VAT law to Acquiror which shows the
Purchase Price attributable to the transferred German based Transferred Assets
(other than the assets transferred under  _Section 7.04(a), (b) and (c)_) as
a net payment together with the amount of VAT levied on such net payment. The
Company shall promptly correct any material failure of such invoice to meet
the requirements of the German VAT Act as is reasonably identified by the
Acquiror in writing within a reasonable period following the Closing.

 



64 (e) If, according to the competent tax authority, Acquiror is not entitled to
an input VAT refund in the full amount of the VAT payable levied for a sale
and transfer under this Agreement, the non-recoverable VAT shall be borne
entirely by Acquiror.

 

Section 7.05 _Tax Contests_. If any claim, suit, action, litigation,
proceeding, assessment, proposed assessment, or demand for Taxes (" _Tax
Contest_ ") related to the Transferred Assets or Business is asserted against
Sellers in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this
Agreement against Acquiror, or any of its Affiliates, Sellers shall notify
Acquiror of such Tax Contest or notice within ten (10) days of receipt thereof
and shall give the Acquiror such information with respect thereto as the
Acquiror may reasonably request. Failure by Sellers to comply with these
provisions shall not relieve the Acquiror of its indemnity obligations under
this Agreement except to the extent that Acquiror is materially prejudiced
thereby. Acquiror may, at its own election and expense, control the defense of
any Tax Contest described in this _Section 7.05_ to the extent such Tax
Contest relates primarily to a Tax for which it is reasonably likely that
Acquiror would have liability under this Agreement. If Acquiror does not elect
to exercise such control, Acquiror shall have the right to participate, at
its own expense, in such Tax Contest to the extent Acquiror had the right to
control such Tax Contest pursuant to this Section 7.05. Sellers shall have the
right, at Sellers own expense, to participate in any such Tax Contest that
Acquiror elects to control. Acquiror shall not settle any such Tax Contest
that it controls without the advance written consent of Sellers (such consent
not to be withheld, delayed or conditioned unreasonably), and Sellers shall
not settle any such Tax Contest that Sellers control in a manner that would
increase the amount of any Tax for which Acquiror is liable under this
Agreement without the advance written consent of Acquiror (such consent not to
be withheld, delayed or conditioned unreasonably).

Section 7.06 _Cooperation_. The parties agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records), documents and powers of
attorney relating to the Transferred Assets and the Business as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election
relating to Taxes, the conduct of any audit, examination or request by any
Governmental Entity, the conduct (control or participation) of a Tax Contest
and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to
any Tax pursuant to this Article VII. The parties shall cooperate in the
conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the
Transferred Assets or the Business. Nothing in _Section 7.05_ or this 
_Section 7.06_ shall be interpreted to require Sellers to share with Acquiror
any information or Tax Returns that do not directly relate to Taxes for which
Acquiror would be required to indemnify Sellers pursuant to this Agreement as
a result of such Tax Contest.

 



65 ARTICLE VIII

 

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

 

Section 8.01 _Conditions to Obligations of each Party_. The respective
obligation of each party to effect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver by such party at or prior to the
Closing of the following conditions:

 

(a) _HSR Approval_. HSR Approval shall have been obtained.

respects as of the date hereof and as of the Closing as though made at and as

Agreement.

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ shall
not be available to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of such party in this Agreement resulted in the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior such date (B) if on November 23, 2015, the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 8.01(a)_ , _8.01(b)_ , _8.01(c)_
or _8.01(d)_ (in the case of _Sections 8.01(c)_ or _8.01(d)_ as a result of
any Restraint or any pending or threatened suit, action or proceeding by any
Governmental Authority or private party, in each case arising under any

shall not have been satisfied or waived but all other conditions to Closing
shall have been satisfied or waived (or, in the case of conditions that by

conclusively resolved and (2) May 23, 2016; or

 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining

this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_ shall not be available
to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor (as it may be adjourned or
postponed);

 



68 (c) by the Acquiror, if there is any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in _Article III_ or if the Company
shall have breached or failed to perform any of their covenants or agreements

8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured
(in each case, to the extent necessary to satisfy the applicable condition set
forth in  _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_), by the Company within 30 days

inaccuracy or failure to perform;

 

(d) by the Company, if there is any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in _Article IV_ or if the Acquiror

set forth in this Agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform
(i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section
8.01_ or _Section 8.03_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured
(in each case, to the extent necessary to satisfy the applicable condition set
forth in _Section 8.01_ or  _Section 8.03_) by the Acquiror within 30 days
following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform;

 

(e) by either the Company or the Acquiror, if the Merger Agreement shall have
been terminated for any reason;

 

(f) by Acquiror, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval,

69 Section 9.02 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Acquiror pursuant to _Section
9.01(f)_ or (B) by the Acquiror or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_
(but, in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, only if the
Merger Agreement was terminated by the Merger Buyer pursuant to Section
8.01(f) of the Merger Agreement);

(ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.01(g)_ or (B) by the Acquiror or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_
(but, in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, only if the
Merger Agreement was terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(g)
of the Merger Agreement);

(iii) (A) after the date hereof and prior to the termination of this
Agreement, a Competing Proposal shall have been made public or communicated
to the Company Board (or any Person shall have publicly announced,
communicated or made known to the Company an intention, whether or not
conditional, to make a Competing Proposal), (B) this Agreement is terminated
(1) by either Acquiror or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_
(unless the Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained prior to any such
termination pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i))_,  _Section 9.01(b)(iii)_ or
_Section 9.01(e)_ (but, in the case of termination pursuant to _Section
9.01(e)_, only if the Merger Agreement was terminated (x) by the Company or
the Merger Buyer pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) of the Merger Agreement or
Section 8.01(b)(iii) of the Merger Agreement (unless the Stockholder Approval
shall have been obtained prior to any such termination pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) of the Merger Agreement) or (y) by the Merger Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.01(c) of the Merger Agreement) or (2) by Acquiror pursuant to
_Section 9.01(c)_ and (C) within twelve months after the date of such
termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement to
consummate, shall have consummated, or the Company Board shall have
recommended to the Companys stockholders, any transaction of the type
referred to in the definition of Competing Proposal (whether or not involving
the Competing Proposal referred to in clause (A) above), then the Company
shall pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee. If the Termination Fee becomes
payable pursuant _Section 9.02(a)(i)_, then the Company shall pay
to Acquiror the Termination Fee as promptly as practicable (and, in any
event, within two Business Days) following such termination. If the
Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_, then the
Company shall pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee concurrently with such
termination. If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section
9.02(a)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee on
the date of consummation of the applicable Competing Proposal. The "
_Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $16,750,000.

 



70 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, payment of the
Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages, and from and after such
termination as described in _Section 9.02(a),_ the Sellers shall have no
further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement
or the termination hereof other than as provided under _Sections 9.02(a)_ and
_9.02(c)_ ; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve the Sellers from any
liability for any intentional and material breach hereof prior to such
termination (it being understood that, without limiting the foregoing, in the
case of any intentional and material breach hereof, any prior payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ shall be taken into account
when determining any remedies). Except in the case of any intentional and
material breach of this Agreement, under no circumstances will the Acquiror be
entitled to monetary damages for any loss or other liability of any kind
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement hereunder or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated in excess of the Termination Fee together with any amounts
due pursuant to _Section 9.02(c)_. In no event shall the Acquiror be
entitled to be paid the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Acquiror would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a
timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Acquiror commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall pay to the Acquiror its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such suit and the collection of such overdue
amount, together with interest on the amount of the judgment, from and
including the date such payment was required to be made until but excluding
the date of payment at the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

 

Section 9.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the
part of any party to this Agreement, except that _Section 5.04(a)_, _Section
9.02_, this _Section 9.03_, and  _Article X_ shall survive such termination;
_provided_ that nothing herein (including the payment of any amounts under
_Section 9.02_) shall relieve any party from any liability for any
intentional and material breach hereof prior to such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _intentional and material breach_ " means a
material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching
party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking of such act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement
(it being understood that the failure of any party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement when known to be or should be
known to be required under the terms of this Agreement, as applicable, shall
constitute an intentional and material breach), and the aggrieved party will
be entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law or in equity,
including in the case of a breach by the Acquiror, liability to the Company
for damages, determined taking into account all relevant factors including the
lost stockholder premium, if any, suffered by the Companys stockholders,
which shall be deemed damages to the

 



71  Company, the Acquirors role (or lack thereof) in causing any such lost
stockholder premium, and any benefit to the Acquiror or its stockholders
arising from such breach, _provided_  that, in the event that the Company
pursues any proceeding against the Acquiror that alleges the failure of the
Acquiror to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
seeks monetary damages in connection with such alleged failure, the Acquiror
may at any time from the commencement of any such proceeding until, if a court
of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment ordering the Acquiror to pay
any such damages, the later of (a) the fifth Business Day after the entry of
such final judgment and (b) if the Acquiror shall have filed a notice
appealing such final judgment within five Business Days after its issuance,
the fifth Business Day after such final judgment shall have become final
and nonappealable (such later date, the " _Closing Notice Deadline_ "),
notify the Company in writing that it will consummate the Closing within five
Business Days following such notice, in which case the parties shall
consummate the Closing on or prior to such fifth Business Day. The Company
shall not be permitted or entitled to enforce any such judgment (i) until the
later of (A) the day following the Closing Notice Deadline and (B) if the
Acquiror provides notice on or prior to the Closing Notice Deadline that it
will consummate the Closing, the end of the fifth Business Day following such
notice or (ii) if the Closing shall have occurred.

 

Section 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after such approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company or Acquiror without such further approval having been obtained. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 9.05 _Extension; Waiver_. Either the Company, with respect to the
Acquiror, or the Acquiror, with respect to the Company, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the party
or parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party or parties hereto contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other party or parties hereto contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

ARTICLE X

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 10.01 _Nonsurvival_. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered

Section 10.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including via facsimile or electronic transmission), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and each of which shall
be deemed to be an original.

 

Section 10.04 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the other Transaction
Agreements and all the other documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement and (b)
are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights,
benefits or remedies, other than the rights of Merger Buyer under _Section

5.08(g)_, _Section 10.01_ and  _Section 10.14(a)_.

Section 10.05 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising out of,
relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or of any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware,
except where German law is mandatory, including the transfer and assignment in
rem of the German Transferred Assets in relation to which German law shall
apply.

 



74 Section 10.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void, except that the Acquiror may
assign any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any direct or indirect, wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, but
no such assignment shall relieve the Acquiror of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.07 _Enforcement of Agreement; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party
hereby agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to the Laws of any jurisdiction or
inequitable, and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), in the chancery courts of the State of
Delaware or in any federal court located in the State of Delaware, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. In addition, each of the Company and the Acquiror (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any such court with respect to
any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
chancery courts of the State of Delaware or in any federal court located in
the State of Delaware. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the chancery
courts of the State of Delaware or in any Federal court located in the State
of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and
agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. The Company hereby agrees that in addition to any other
legally permissible means of service, service of any process, summons, notice
or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in
_Section 10.02_ shall be effective service of process for any proceeding
arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

 



75 Section 10.08 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE COMPANY AND THE ACQUIROR
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY OR
THE ACQUIROR IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF.

Section 10.09 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination

Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third party
beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be resolved in the manner
provided in this _Section 10.14_. Should there

 



77  develop any Dispute, either party may, by written notice to the other party,
request that such Dispute be referred to a representative of the Company or
Merger Buyer (or his or her designee) to be specified by Merger Buyer prior
to the Closing and the Vice President and General Manager of the 3M
Purification Division (or successor business) of the Acquiror (or his or her
designee) and (together, the " _Principals_ "), who shall negotiate in good
faith to attempt to resolve such Dispute. No settlement reached under this
_Section 10.14(a)_ shall be binding on the parties until reduced to a writing
signed by the Principals on behalf of the parties.

 

(b) Should the procedure outlined in _Section 10.14(a)_ fail to bring about a
resolution of each outstanding Dispute within thirty (30) days following the
giving of the written notice referred to therein, then the parties shall
promptly initiate a voluntary, non-binding mediation conducted by a mutually-
agreed mediator. The Company and the Acquiror shall (i) endeavor in good
faith to resolve in such mediation each outstanding Dispute and (ii) each bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of such mediator and such mediation;
_provided_ , that all other costs and expenses incurred by the parties
in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section 10.14(b)_ shall
be borne by the parties in accordance with _Section 10.02_. No settlement
reached under this _Section 10.14(b)_ shall be binding on the parties until
reduced to a writing signed by the Principals on behalf of the parties.

(c) Neither Party shall commence any Action in respect of any Dispute until
forty-five (45) days following the appointment of a mediator in respect of
such Dispute as contemplated by _Section 10.14(b)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this _Section
10.14_, and without prejudice to the above procedures, either party may at
any time, in connection with any Dispute, apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction in the forum and venue specified in _Section 10.07_ for
temporary injunctive or other provisional judicial relief if, in such
partys sole judgment, such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage
or to preserve the status quo until such time as the Dispute is otherwise
resolved in accordance with this _Section 10.14_.

 

Section 10.15 _Performance of Sellers  Obligations Hereunder_. To the extent
that any provision in this Agreement represents a direct obligation or
covenant of any Seller or Sellers (including any Sellers German Entity), then
(i) to the extent that such obligation is required to be performed by such
Person prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause each such Person, to the
extent within such Persons control, to perform such obligation or covenant
completely and in full and (ii) to the extent that such obligation is required
to be performed by such Person at or following the Closing, the Company shall
cause each such Person to perform such obligation or covenant, as if such
Person were a party hereto.
