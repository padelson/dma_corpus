agree and acknowledge that they are entering into this  Agreement on behalf
of themselves and certain of their respective Affiliates. Seller guarantees
the performance or non-performance of all actions, agreements and obligations
to be performed or not to be performed by any Subsidiaries or Affiliates  of

Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Seller under  the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Seller shall be deemed to be acting on behalf of such Subsidiaries
or Affiliates.

Notwithstanding          anything to the contrary contained herein,

assignment or transfer thereof, without the Consent of any third party or

Closing. Prior to the Closing, and except as set forth in _Section 6.2_ , the
Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective 
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consents required to assign or
transfer any such Non-Transferable Asset. If the Parties are not successful in
obtaining any Consents to assign or transfer any Non-Transferable Asset at or
prior to the  Closing,

 

 

-22-  

then the Parties agree that for a period of one (1) year after the Closing,
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to  obtain such Consent. The
fact of a failure to obtain any such Consent shall not, in and of itself,
result in a breach of this Agreement in any manner.

 

(b) If the Parties are not successful in assigning or transferring any Non-
Transferable Asset or any right, benefit or obligation thereunder or resulting
therefrom  at or prior to the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_ ,

arrangements designed  to provide Buyer with the benefits and burdens of any
such Non-Transferable Asset and any right, benefit or obligation thereunder or
resulting therefrom as if the appropriate Consent had been obtained, including
provision of the consideration and  other economic benefits to be received by
Buyer in and under every Non-Transferable Asset and right, benefit or
obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom, which consideration shall be
held for the benefit of, and shall be promptly delivered to,  Buyer (it being
acknowledged and agreed that, in connection therewith, Seller will cause the
Shared Products to be acquired pursuant to any such Non-Transferable Asset to
be allocated to Buyer in accordance with the applicable Inventory 
Proportion). Once the applicable Consent for the assignment or transfer of any
such Non-Transferable Asset not assigned or transferred at the Closing is
obtained, Seller shall assign and transfer such Non-Transferable Asset to
Buyer at no  additional cost. To the extent that Buyer is provided the
benefits and burdens of any Non-Transferable Asset or right, benefit or
obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom referred to herein (whether from
Seller or otherwise) as if the  appropriate Consent had been obtained, Buyer
shall discharge and perform the Liabilities of Seller thereunder or in
connection therewith (other than obligations under Shared Contracts relating
to requirements obligations, exclusivity,  non-competition or other
restrictive covenants), as applicable, to the same extent as if the
appropriate Consent had been obtained (it being understood that any assumption
by Buyer of any burdens, obligations or Liabilities shall be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement, including _Section 2.4_ ).

 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, after the Closing Seller shall exercise
and  enforce, on behalf of and at the request of Buyer, the rights of Seller
and its Subsidiaries under the Shared Contracts to which Buyer is entitled
pursuant to _Section  2.5(b)_.

 

(d) Neither Party nor any of its respective Affiliates shall (i) in connection
with obtaining the Consents referred to in _Section 2.5(a),_ have any
obligation to pay sums of money or provide any guarantee or other
consideration, or agree to any undertaking, or otherwise agree to any  action
that would adversely affect such Party or its Affiliates, or such Party's or
its Affiliates' businesses or operations, or any right or obligation of such
Party or under any Contract related to such Consents, (ii) waive or discharge
any  liabilities or obligations owing to the other Party or its Affiliates by
any counterparty under any Contract, (iii) waive any rights of the other Party
or its Affiliates under any Contract or (iv) amend, modify, supplement or
otherwise change in  any material respect (including any change that
adversely affects pricing) the terms of any Contract that would adversely
affect the other Party or its Affiliates (except, in the case of this clause
(iv), as contemplated by _Section 9.3_ ).

 

Section 2.6 _Purchase Price_. As full consideration for the sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and delivery to Buyer of the Acquired Assets by the
Selling Parties, Buyer  shall (i) deliver to Seller at the Closing a wire
transfer(s) of immediately available funds in an amount equal to $167,500,000
(the "Base Consideration"),         minus (x) the Inventory

Section 2.8 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities

manner consistent with the principles set forth  on _Schedule 2.8(a)_ and in

Closing Date, Buyer will deliver a draft schedule to Seller  (the "Allocation
Schedule") consistent with _Schedule 2.8(a)_ and  the Allocation Laws that

items) to the Acquired Assets. Unless Seller notifies Buyer in writing within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of the draft Allocation  Schedule that
Seller considers the amount allocated to any assets to not be in accordance
with the Allocation Laws, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to the
Allocation Schedule as prepared by Buyer. If Seller disputes any portion of
the draft  Allocation Schedule in accordance with the preceding sentence, the
Parties shall attempt to resolve any disagreement in good faith. If the
Parties do not agree on an alternative allocation in the ten (10) days
following the date Buyer received  Seller's written notice, the Parties shall
submit the dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule on the next
Business Day to an independent accountant whose review shall be limited to
whether a disputed item has been prepared in accordance  with the Allocation
Laws and shall be final and binding on all Parties. The fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be shared in equal amounts by
Seller and Buyer. If the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this 
Agreement, the final Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted as appropriate and
the Parties shall cooperate in making any such adjustments.

 

(b) The Parties shall report all Taxes and timely file all Tax Returns
(including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) consistent with  the
final Allocation Schedule and shall take no position inconsistent therewith
except to the extent required by any audits or examinations by any Taxing
Authority. Buyer and Seller (or any of their respective Affiliates) shall

forms and shall cooperate in the filing of any  such forms, including any
amendments to such forms required as a result of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.3 _Post-Closing Inventory Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail Buyer's good faith calculations of (i) the Closing Inventory
and (ii) the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 2.6_.

 

(b) In the event that Seller does not object to the Closing Statement by a
written notice of objection (the "Closing Statement Dispute Notice") delivered
to Buyer within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Statement by
Seller, Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to the  Closing
Statement shall be deemed final and binding on each party hereto. If Seller
disputes the Closing Statement prepared by Buyer, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Statement, the
Closing  Statement Dispute Notice setting forth Seller's calculation of the
Closing Inventory and its resulting calculation of the Purchase Price. Buyer
and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve the dispute for a
period of thirty (30) days  after Seller has submitted to Buyer the Closing
Statement Dispute Notice. In connection with the preparation or review of the
Closing Statement or the Closing Statement Dispute Notice, as the case may be,
each Party shall provide promptly to the  other Party and such other Party's
Representatives all non-privileged and historical books, records and
documentation as the other Party shall reasonably request.

 

(c) If Buyer and Seller have not resolved the calculation of Closing Inventory
within thirty (30) days after Seller submitted to Buyer the Closing Statement
Dispute  Notice, then, within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such
period, Buyer and Seller shall submit the dispute to a jointly appointed (x)
independent and impartial certified public accountant who is a partner at a
neutral nationally  recognized accounting firm in the United States that is
not the auditor or independent accounting firm of, and is otherwise
independent of, the Parties or any of their

 

 

-26-  

respective Affiliates or (y) a partner at a neutral nationally recognized
business advisory or consulting firm that is  independent of the Parties and
any of their respective Affiliates (the "Transaction Expert") for final and
binding determination of Closing Inventory.  If the Parties are unable to
timely appoint a Transaction Expert within fifteen (15) days of the expiration
of the thirty (30) day resolution period described above, either Buyer or
Seller may request that the American Arbitration Association  appoint a
Transaction Expert, which Transaction Expert shall be a certified public
accountant (with significant public accounting experience, including in
connection with business combinations) and shall not have provided services to
Buyer or  Seller or any of their Affiliates in the preceding two (2) years.
The fees and disbursements of the Transaction Expert and the American
Arbitration Association shall be borne by Buyer and Seller, in inverse
proportion to how each of Buyer or Seller  prevails on matters resolved by
the Transaction Expert, which proportionate allocations shall also be
determined by the Transaction Expert.

 

(d) The Transaction Expert shall review and determine the Closing Inventory,
in a manner consistent with this _Section 3.3(d)_ and the definition of
Closing Inventory. The Transaction Expert is not to make any determination
other than the Closing Inventory, including any determination as to whether
the Inventory  Threshold is correct. The review and determination of the
Transaction Expert shall be based solely on the written submissions presented
by Buyer and Seller (without any evidentiary hearing) and not by independent
review. In no event shall the  Transaction Expert's determination of Closing
Inventory be for an amount outside the ranges proposed by Seller and Buyer in
the Closing Statement and the Closing Statement Dispute Notice, respectively.

 

(e) Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Transaction
Expert to issue its final written award regarding the Closing Inventory within
thirty (30)  days after such written submissions are provided for review, and
otherwise as soon as practicable. The award shall include a reasonably
detailed explanation of the changes, if any, required to be made to the
Closing Statement. The award shall be  final and binding upon the Parties,
and judgment may be entered on the award; provided, however, that within seven
(7) days after transmittal by the Transaction Expert of the award, either
Party may request in writing with a copy to the other  Party, that the
Transaction Expert correct any clerical or typographical errors in the award.
The other Party shall have seven (7) days to respond and the Parties shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the Transaction Expert to issue a ruling on  such
request within five (5) days after such seven (7) day period.

 

(f) The Parties agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.3_
for  resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Statement shall be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes and, without
limiting the representations or warranties in this Agreement, the
indemnifications provisions set forth in  _Article XII_ hereof shall not
apply to any such dispute; provided, that this provision shall not prohibit
any Party from instituting litigation to enforce the  ruling of the
Transaction Expert.

 

(g) If Buyer and Seller resolve the Disputed Items during the thirty (30) day
period referred to in _Section 3.3(b)_ , such resolution shall be memorialized
in writing and the Purchase Price agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to
be the "Purchase Price". If Buyer and Seller do not so resolve the  Disputed
Items during the thirty (30) day period referred to in _Section 3.3(b)_ and
the Closing Inventory is determined by the Transaction Expert, the Purchase 
Price as adjusted by the Parties to reflect the determination by the
Transaction Expert of the Closing Inventory pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 3.3_ or as  otherwise agreed pursuant to a written

 

 

-27-  

agreement of the Parties shall be deemed to be the "Purchase Price". If Seller
does not timely deliver a Closing Statement  Dispute Notice to Buyer or the
Parties agree in writing that Seller shall not deliver a Closing Statement
Dispute Notice, then the Purchase Price proposed by Buyer in its Closing
Statement shall be deemed to be the "Purchase Price".

 

(h) If the Purchase Price determined in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_ is
less  than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price and such
Purchase Price. If the Purchase Price determined in accordance with _Section
3.3(g)_ is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to the difference between such Purchase Price and the
Estimated Purchase Price.   If the Purchase Price determined in accordance
with _Section 3.3(g)_ is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, then no
payment shall be due under this _Section 3.3(h)_. Any amounts due pursuant to
this _Section 3.3(h)_ shall be paid  promptly by the relevant Party (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days) after the final determination thereof
in cash in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller or Buyer (as  applicable).

Party and  the conduct of the Business thereat does not violate any
applicable Laws (including zoning Laws) or any Permitted Liens. To Seller's

accepts and commences employment with Buyer on or within five (5) Business
Days following the Closing Date shall be a "Continuing  Employee." Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enroll the Continuing Employees
on Buyer's or an Affiliate's Benefits Plans that provide for health and
welfare benefits ("Buyer HandW Plans") immediately as of the Closing, and at
such time the Continuing Employees shall cease to participate in or accrue
further benefits under any Seller Benefit Plan, except  that if Buyer is
unable to enroll the Continuing Employees in Buyer HandW Plans immediately as of
the Closing, the Continuing Employees shall continue to participate in Seller
Benefit Plans that provide for health and welfare benefits for a  period of
up to sixty (60) days following the Closing (or such shorter period of time,
or not at all, as determined by the Buyer, in its sole discretion); _provided_
,  that Buyer shall reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for the
reasonable, out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller and its Affiliates with
respect to such benefits continuation, following Buyer's receipt of
documentation which is reasonably  satisfactory to Buyer evidencing such
costs incurred by Seller, which shall be provided no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days following the end of the calendar month in which such costs were
incurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Business  Employee on a leave of
absence on the Closing Date shall be offered employment with the Buyer,
effective following the expiration of such leave of absence (provided that
such employee returns from leave of absence on or prior to the six-month 
anniversary of the Closing Date) and until such time such Business Employee
shall remain an employee of Seller and the Liabilities of such Business
Employee shall remain the Liabilities of Seller.

 

Section 7.2 _Compensation          and Benefits_. Effective as of the
Closing and through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing, Buyer shall
provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, to each Continuing
Employee, (a) a base salary or hourly wage rate that  is not less than the
base salary or hourly wage rate in effect for such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, as disclosed under _Schedule 4.16(a)_ , 
(b) annual cash bonus and/or commission opportunities using targets and
metrics determined by Buyer to be substantially no less favorable in the
aggregate for all Continuing Employees (taken as a whole) than the aggregate
annual cash bonus and  commission opportunities for all Continuing Employees
(taken as a whole) that are in effect prior to the Closing and (c) employee
benefits (excluding any long-term incentive or equity-based incentive
opportunities) that are no less favorable than  those provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates.

 

Section 7.3 _Service Credit_. Effective as of the Closing and thereafter,
Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, use commercially reasonable 
efforts to fully recognize for each Continuing Employee those periods of
employment with Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to the

 

 

-52-  

same extent such service was recognized by Seller or its Affiliates for
vesting and eligibility and level of benefits purposes  under all Benefit
Plans maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates, including vacation or other paid-
time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k) plans and any severance or health or
welfare plans (other than for purposes of determining any accrued benefit 
under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a duplication of
benefits).

 

Section 7.4 _Welfare Plans_. Effective as of the Closing and thereafter, Buyer
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) ensure that no eligibility waiting periods or  pre-existing condition
limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing Employees
under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (except to the extent applicable under Seller Benefit  Plans
immediately prior to the Closing) and (b) waive any and all evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to the Continuing Employees to the
extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the
Continuing  Employees under the Seller Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing.

 

Section 7.5 _Defined Contribution Plans_.  Buyer shall cause each Continuing
Employee who is a participant in a Seller Benefit Plan intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code that includes a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the  Code (the
"Seller 401(k) Plan") to be allowed to participate, effective as of the
Closing, in a tax qualified plan which includes a cash or deferred 
arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code
that is sponsored and maintained by Buyer or an Affiliate thereof (the
"Buyer  401(k) Plan"). In addition, subject to acceptance by the
administrator of Buyer 401(k) Plan (which Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such administrator to accept), Buyer shall cause
the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept  rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
excluding loans) from the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

Section 7.6 _No Transfer of Seller Benefit Plan or  Assets_. No Seller
Benefit Plan or any assets thereunder shall be transferred to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (or, in the case of plan assets, to any benefit plan of Buyer)
(other than by way of a rollover contribution elected by a  Business Employee
in accordance with _Section 7.5_ or except as required by applicable Law).
Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all liabilities  and
obligations under the Seller Benefit Plans and any other benefit plans of
Seller or its Affiliates, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any liability with respect thereto, other than as provided in the
immediately preceding  sentence.

 

Section 7.7 _WARN Act_. On or before the Closing Date, Seller will provide to
Buyer an accurate and complete list of the  employees, by position and
location, who have experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or
layoff (as defined in the U.S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act or any other similar displaced worker notification Law ("WARN")) within 90
days prior to the Closing Date, along with the date of the employment loss or
layoff.

 

Section 7.8 _Non-U.S. Employees_. The principles and provisions of this
_Article          VII_ shall apply to Business Employees and
Continuing Employees based outside of the United States ("Non-U.S. Employees")
in the same  manner as Business Employees and Continuing Employees,
respectively, based in the United States, to the maximum extent practicable
and permissible by applicable Law. Buyer and Seller agree to comply with all
applicable non-U.S. Laws regarding

 

 

-53-  

the transfer of Non-U.S. Employees and to cooperate with each other in
effectuating this _Article VII_ as it applies to Non-U.S. Employees.

 

Section 7.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in  this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (a) be treated as an amendment
or modification of any Benefit Plan; (b) without limiting the generality of
_Section 13.7_ ,  give any Person (including, without limitation, any current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any Benefit
Plan or trustee thereof) other than a Party any right to enforce the
provisions of this _Article VII_ ; (c) modify the at-will nature of any
employee's employment (or in the case of Business Employees located in Canada,
prevent a termination on reasonable  notice or pay in lieu thereof in
accordance with applicable Laws); or (d) obligate Seller or Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular Benefit Plan, (ii)
refrain from amending or terminating any particular Benefit  Plan, (iii)
retain the employment of any particular employee or (iv) refrain from changing
the terms and conditions of employment.

 

Section 7.10 _Cooperation for Employees; Communications_. Except as prohibited
by applicable Law, Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer, at  Buyer's
reasonable request, to provide Buyer with any information or copies of
personnel records (including addresses, dates of birth, dates of hire and
dependent information) relating to the Continuing Employees or relating to the
service of  Continuing Employees with the Selling Parties prior to the
Closing Date that are necessary for the Seller's and its Affiliates'
compliance with the provisions of this _Article          VII_. Seller
shall not, at any time prior to, on, or after the Closing, communicate with
Business Employees regarding any compensation or benefits to be  provided by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing without the prior consent of
Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, other than providing (i)
the form offer letter provided by Buyer to Seller and (ii) a summary of
Buyer's  Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may participate
following the Closing (which summary may be in "FAQ" form and shall be
provided by Buyer to Seller no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof).

 

Section 7.11 _Accrued Sick Leave Time and Bonus_. Seller shall be responsible
for, and within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date shall pay, 
accrued but unused sick leave time and annual bonuses and commissions as
follows: (i) Seller or one of its Affiliates shall pay each Business Employee
a lump sum payment equal to his or her accrued but unused sick leave time;
(ii) Seller or one of  its Affiliates shall pay each Business Employee a lump
sum payment equal to his or her fiscal 2019 annual bonus and accrued but
unpaid fiscal 2019 commissions, with the amounts of the fiscal 2019 annual
bonuses and fiscal 2019 commissions  determined by Seller in the Ordinary
Course of Business; (iii) Seller or one of its Affiliates shall pay each
Continuing Employee a lump sum payment equal to his or her target fiscal 2020
annual bonus, with the target fiscal 2020 annual bonuses to  be no less than
the target opportunity established for fiscal 2019 and prorated for the period
of service during fiscal 2020 prior to the Closing Date; and (iv) Seller or
one of its Affiliates shall pay each Business Employee any unpaid fiscal
2020  commissions earned through the Closing Date, with such commissions
determined by Seller in the Ordinary Course of Business. The foregoing amounts
shall be reduced for applicable withholding taxes and other authorized and
required deductions.

  TAX MATTERS

 

Section 8.1 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50%  by Buyer
and 50% by Seller, and each Party shall indemnify the other Party for any such
Transfer Taxes to the extent necessary to achieve such sharing. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate to timely prepare any Tax Returns relating to such
Transfer  Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the
imposition of any Transfer Taxes. The Party required by applicable Law to file
any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes shall do so and promptly
following the filing thereof,  furnish to the other Party a copy of such Tax
Return and a copy of a receipt showing payment of any such Transfer Tax.

 

Section 8.2 _Straddle Period Non-Income Taxes_. In the case of any Property
Taxes and other  non-income Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes governed by
_Section 8.1_ ) attributable to the Acquired Assets for any Straddle Period,
Seller shall be responsible for  the portion of such Taxes attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Buyer shall be responsible for the portion of
such Taxes attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. The amount of such
Taxes that are allocable to Seller for the Pre-Closing  Tax Period shall be
the amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the 
entire Straddle Period, and the amount of such Taxes allocable to Buyer for
the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be determined in the same manner except that
the numerator shall be the number of days in such Straddle Period beginning on
the day after  the Closing Date. The Party required by applicable Law to pay
to the Governmental Authority any such Taxes for a Straddle Period and to file
any related Tax Return (the "Paying Party") shall provide the other party (the
"Non-Paying Party") a statement setting forth the Non-Paying Party's  share
of such Taxes for a Straddle Period as determined pursuant to this _Section
8.2_ , together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to 
calculate such amount, and the Non-Paying Party shall pay the Paying Party its
share of such Taxes, not later than five (5) Business Days before the due date
for payment of such Taxes. The Paying Party shall furnish the Non-Paying Party
a copy of  any such Tax Return and a copy of a receipt showing payment of any
such Taxes to the Governmental Authority.

 

Section 8.3 _Tax Cooperation_. Subject  to _Section 9.1_ , Buyer and Seller
agree to furnish or cause their Affiliates to furnish, to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information  and assistance
relating to the Acquired Assets or the Business as is reasonably necessary for
the filing of all Tax Returns and other Tax filings, the preparation for any
audit by any Taxing Authority and the defense of any Claim or Proceeding 
relating to Taxes of the Acquired Assets or the Business; _provided_ , that
Buyer will not be permitted to inspect or otherwise review any Consolidated
Tax Return.

 

Section 8.4 _Miscellaneous_. After the Closing, except as required under
applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall not  cause or permit any of its
Affiliates to, (a) make, change or revoke any Tax election with respect to the
Acquired Assets or the Business that has any retroactive effect for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, or (b) grant an extension of any applicable  statute of
limitations that relates to Taxes with respect to the Acquired Assets or the
Business that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the prior written
consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably

 

 

-55-  

withheld. Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate to,
take any action on the Closing Date other than in  the ordinary course of
business.

 

Section 8.5 _Tax Provision Priority_. To the extent that this _Article VIII_
conflicts with any other provision in  this Agreement, this _Article VIII_
shall govern.

 

ARTICLE IX 


 

  OTHER AGREEMENTS

 

Section 9.1 _Books and Records; Access;  Assistance_. (a) For a period of six
(6) years following the Closing, Buyer and Seller will, upon reasonable
notice, provide access to the financial and other records, information, books
and records and  Tax Returns solely pertaining to the Business, the Acquired
Assets or the Products of the Business (other than any Consolidated Tax
Returns) (a) relating to the period prior to the Closing and to the extent
necessary or useful for Seller or its  Affiliates in connection with any
audit, investigation, dispute or litigation, in each case with a third party,
or with or by any Governmental Authority, or any other reasonable business
purpose, or to comply with any tax, accounting, regulatory or  similar
requirements or (b) to the extent requested by Buyer for any reason;
_provided_ , that any such access by Buyer or Seller shall not unreasonably
interfere  with the conduct of Buyer's or Seller's business. Buyer and Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to preserve, for at least six (6) years
after the Closing Date or, if applicable and later, the expiration of the
applicable statutes of  limitations or extensions thereof: (i) all such
financial and other records, information and books and records, and (ii) Tax
Returns solely pertaining to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Products
(other than any Consolidated Tax Returns).  Seller shall have the right to
retain copies of all information and documents provided by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and copies of all other Books  and Records, in each
case to the extent such information, documents or Books and Records includes
information related to the Retained Business; _provided_ that  such copies
shall be deemed Buyer Information. The right to access provided by this
_Section 9.1_ shall include the right to make copies of accessed documents;
_provided_ , that all such copies shall be at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting Party. The Party providing access under this _Section 9.1_ shall
have the right to reasonably redact all such documents.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 9.1_ shall not provide Buyer
or  Seller (or Representatives or Subsidiaries of any thereof) any access
rights to documents or information of the other Party (i) which access would
violate any Laws or obligations regarding the confidentiality thereof (unless
any such violation  could be and is avoided by the recipient's execution and
delivery of an appropriate confidentiality agreement), (ii) with respect to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
personnel-related information, the  disclosure of which would, in a Party's
good faith opinion, subject the Party or any of its Affiliates to risk of
Liability or (iii) which access would waive any attorney-client, work product,
or like privilege (it being understood that Buyer and  Seller shall take
reasonable actions to eliminate any such impediments set forth in clauses (i)
through (iii) to providing such information).

 

Section 9.2 _Wrong Pocket Assets; Transfer of Assets_. (a) Subject to _Section
2.5_ , if any Acquired Asset remains vested in or in the possession of Seller
or any of its Affiliates following Closing, Seller shall (or shall cause its 
applicable Affiliate to) transfer such Acquired Asset as soon

 

 

-56-  

as reasonably practicable to Buyer or its designee for no additional
consideration (it being acknowledged and agreed that Buyer  shall have
already paid good consideration for all Acquired Assets by paying the Purchase
Price). Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable upon
becoming aware that that there are any Acquired Assets in its possession or
control  or that of any Affiliate of Seller.

 

(b) If any Excluded Asset, including the amount of any Seller Tax Refund, is
vested in or in the possession of Buyer or any of its Affiliates following
Closing,  Buyer shall (or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to) transfer
such Excluded Asset (including the amount of any Seller Tax Refund) as soon as
reasonably practicable to Seller or its designee for no consideration (it
being acknowledged and agreed  that the Parties have not agreed to sell such
Excluded Asset). Buyer shall notify Seller as soon as reasonably practicable
upon becoming aware that that there are any Excluded Assets in its possession
or control. Buyer and its Affiliates shall use  commercially reasonable
efforts to file or make any claim for such Seller Tax Refund at the sole cost
and expense of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall bear 50% of
the reasonable costs and expenses of filing a claim for any Straddle Period.

 

(c) From time to time following the Closing, as and when requested by a Party,
the other Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,  at the requesting
Party's expense (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement),
execute such documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably
required to carry out the provisions hereof and consummate and evidence the 
Transactions, including executing and delivering or causing to be executed and
delivered to such Party such documents as such Party or its counsel may
reasonably request as necessary for such purpose.

 

Section 9.3 _Shared Contracts_. From and after the date hereof,  Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer to cause the counterparty to any
Shared Contract to consent to the partial assignment, effective not prior to
the Closing  Date, of those rights of Seller and its Subsidiaries related to
the Business or enter into a new agreement with Buyer with respect to the
matters addressed by such Shared Contract that are related to the Business;
_provided_ , that neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to compromise any right, asset or benefit (nor shall they be permitted to do
so) or expend any amount or incur any  liabilities or provide any other
consideration in connection therewith. Any Shared Contract for which the
arrangements described in this _Section 9.3_ could not be entered into prior
to the Closing shall be a Non-Transferable Asset.

 

Section 9.4 _Accounts Receivable_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that all Accounts  Receivable shall remain the property of Seller and its
Affiliates and shall be collected by Seller subsequent to the Closing solely
in the Ordinary Course of Business. In the event that, subsequent to the
Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates  receives any payments from any
obligor with respect to an account receivable outstanding on the Closing Date,
then Buyer shall within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of such payment
remit the full amount of such payment to Seller or its  Affiliate, as
applicable. In the case of the receipt by Buyer of any payment from any
obligor of Seller and Buyer, then unless otherwise specified by such
obligor,  Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether
such payment constitutes a payment made with respect to an Account Receivable
of Seller or its Affiliates related to the operation of the Business prior to
the Closing Date or a  payment made with respect to an account receivable of
Buyer or the

 

 

-57-  

Business related to the operation of the Business on or after the Closing
Date. In the event that, subsequent to the Closing,  Seller or any of its
Affiliates receives any payments from any obligor with respect to an account
receivable of Buyer or the Business, including an account receivable related
to a Shared Contract for which Buyer is entitled to the right or benefit 
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ , for any period after the Closing Date, then Seller
or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall within twenty (20) Business Days of
receipt of  such payment remit the full amount of such payment to Buyer. In
the case of the receipt by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any payment from
any obligor of Seller and Buyer, then unless otherwise specified by such
obligor, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether
such payment constitutes a payment made with respect to an Account Receivable
of Seller or its  Affiliates related to the operation of the Business prior
to the Closing Date or a payment made with respect to an account receivable of
Buyer or the Business related to the operation of the Business on or after the
Closing Date.

 

Section 9.5 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, the Business shall cease
to be insured by Seller or its Affiliates' current and historical insurance
policies or programs or by any of the current and historical  self-insured
programs of Seller or its Affiliates, and neither Buyer nor its Affiliates
shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in any insurance
policies or programs or self-insured programs of Seller and its Affiliates
(including to  any claims or rights to make claims or any rights to
proceeds). Seller or any of its Affiliates may, to be effective at the
Closing, amend any insurance policies and ancillary arrangements in the manner
they deem appropriate to give effect to this  _Section 9.5_. From and after
the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for its operation of the Business. Buyer  further
covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise any rights or claims
of the Business under or in respect of any past or current insurance policy,
program or self-insurance program of Seller or its Affiliates.

 

Section 9.6 _Product Returns and Recalls_. Buyer shall be solely responsible
for handling, processing, providing refunds  for and otherwise administering
returns for all Products after the Closing Date; _provided_ that  Seller
shall be financially responsible for returns that are Excluded Liabilities. If
any Selling Party is asked by a customer to process, issue credit or remit
payment for any Product return for which Buyer is responsible under this
_Section 9.6_ , such Selling Party shall refer such customer to Buyer for
processing. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the sole right
to conduct all  voluntary and involuntary recalls or market withdrawals of
Products (whether sold before or after Closing), including (a) recalls
required by any Governmental Authority and (b) voluntary recalls and market
withdrawals of Product sold prior to or  after the Closing. Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer's reasonable requests to assist Buyer in implementing and
effecting such recall or market withdrawal, to the extent relating to Products
manufactured or sold prior to Closing or Products included in the Acquired
Assets.

 

Section 9.7 _Data Room_. Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer ten (10) DVDs containing copies of the 
Data Room, which shall include for each document contained therein the date
such document was uploaded to the Data Room.

 

 

-58-  

Section 9.8 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) Seller covenants and agrees that, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (whether as principal, agent, 
independent contractor, partner or otherwise):

 

(i) for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, engage, invest or have any interest (either 
directly or indirectly, as a principal or for its own account, solely or
jointly with others, or as equity holders or otherwise) in the Business or in
any business or Person that competes with the Business as conducted as of the
Closing Date (a "Competing Business") anywhere in the world (it being
understood by the parties hereto that the Business is not limited to any
particular geographic  region and that the Business may be engaged in
effectively from any location); provided that nothing in this _Section 9.8_
shall preclude Seller or any of its Affiliates from:

 

(A) owning up to two percent (2%) of any Person engaged in a Competing
Business if (A) such Competing Business is publicly traded and  (B) Seller or
such Affiliate does not control the operation or management of such Competing
Business;

 

(B) entering into and consummating an agreement with any Person with respect
to a merger, share exchange or other business combination  transaction with
respect to Seller immediately following which the beneficial owners of the

twenty-five percent (25%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding
voting capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(or Persons performing a similar function) of the entity resulting from such
transaction, and in  the event of such transaction, the restrictions
contained in this _Section 9.8_ shall not apply to such acquirer or its
Affiliates, except that such restrictions  shall continue to apply to Seller
(or the surviving company in a merger or combination with Seller if the
surviving company is a Subsidiary of such acquirer) and its  Subsidiaries; or

 

(C) acquiring any entity, assets or business that is or are engaged in a
Competing Business if the revenues from the Competing Business  constitute
less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total revenues generated by such
entity, assets or business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller or its
Affiliate, as applicable, shall divest the portion of such entity, assets or
business that is engaged in a Competing Business within twelve (12) months 
following the acquisition thereof;

 

(ii) for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, solicit for purposes of employment or
hire  (or engage as a contractor or consultant) any Business Employee, or
otherwise solicit, induce or otherwise encourage any Business Employee to
discontinue, or refrain from entering into any employment relationship
(contractual or otherwise) with  Buyer or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the  foregoing, for purposes of this
Agreement, the Selling Parties shall not be prohibited from (A) placing
general advertisements or conducting general employment

 

 

-59-  

solicitations (including via a search firm inquiry) that are not targeted at
any Continuing Employee or the Business, or (B)  soliciting or hiring any
Continuing Employee that has been terminated without cause by Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Buyer covenants and agrees that for a period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the second  (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly
(whether as principal, agent, independent contractor, partner or otherwise)
solicit for purposes of employment or hire (or engage  as a contractor or
consultant) any Non-Business Employee with whom Buyer or its Representatives
has had contact prior to Closing to discontinue or refrain from entering into
any employment relationship (contractual or otherwise) with Seller or any  of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the 
foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
be prohibited from (i) placing general advertisements or conducting general
employment solicitations (including via a search firm inquiry) that are not
targeted at any  such Non-Business Employee, or (ii) soliciting or hiring any
such Non-Business Employee that has been terminated without cause by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) It is the intent and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any
action before any court or agency legally empowered to enforce this _Section
9.8_ , any term, restriction, covenant or promise in this _Section 9.8_   is
found to be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term,
restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable by such court or agency. The period of time
in which a Person is  required to act, or refrain from acting, pursuant to
this _Section 9.8_ shall be tolled (shall not run) for so long as such Person
is in breach of any of such  Person's obligations hereunder.

representations and warranties, other than _Section 4.5(a)_ , read for such
purposes without any materiality  or Material Adverse Effect qualifications)
as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date with the
same force and effect as if they had been made at such time (except that
representations and warranties that by their terms speak  specifically as of
the date of this Agreement or some other date shall be true and correct as of
such date), except for inaccuracies that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse
Effect, and (iii) since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have
occurred any Effect that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior  to the

controlling the  Business or the Acquired Assets or materially impairs the
right or ability of Buyer to own, operate or control the Business or the

to prevent the consummation of the  Transactions or seeks to prohibit or
materially impair the right or ability of Buyer to own, operate or control the
Business or the Acquired Assets, or (iii) any Proceeding by any Governmental
Authority that may result in the imposition of criminal  liability or the
imposition of regulatory fines or material damages with respect to the
Business.

(d) Seller shall have delivered to Buyer each of the documents and other
deliverables required to be delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_.

 

Section 10.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Except as required by Law,
neither Seller nor  Buyer may rely on the failure of any condition set forth
in _Section 10.1_ , _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ , as the case may be, to
be satisfied if such Party's breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set  forth in this Agreement has been the principal cause of
such failure.

has not occurred by 11:59 p.m.,  New York City Time, on the date that is one
hundred twenty (120) days after the date hereof (the "Outside Date");
_provided_ , that if all of the conditions set forth in _Section 10.1_ ,

initial Outside; _provided_ , _further_ , that  the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant  or agreement
set forth in this Agreement has been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the
Closing not occurring prior to the Outside Date;

 

(c) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if Buyer shall have breached any of
its representations or warranties or failed to comply with  any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure
(i) would give rise to the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
10.2(a)_   or _Section 10.2(b)_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is
not cured, by Buyer within thirty (30) days following receipt of written
notice of such breach or  failure to comply from Seller _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to  terminate this Agreement under this _Section
11.1(c)_ shall not be available to Seller if Seller has breached any of its
representations or warranties or failed to  comply with any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure would
result in any of the closing conditions in _Section 10.3(a)_ or  _Section
10.3(b)_ not being satisfied;

 

(d) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller, if Seller shall have breached any
of its representations or  warranties or failed to comply with any of its

(i) would give rise to the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
10.3(a)_ or _Section 10.3(b)_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not
cured, by Seller within thirty  (30) days following receipt of written notice
of such breach or failure to comply from Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(d)_ shall not
be available to Buyer if  Buyer has breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to comply with any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure

 

 

-62-  

would result in any of the closing conditions in
_Section            10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.2(b)_ not being
satisfied; or

 

(e) by either Seller or Buyer, by written notice to the other, in the event of
any final and nonappealable  Adverse Law or Order.

 

Each termination condition set forth in this _Section  11.1_ shall be
considered separate and distinct from each other such condition. If more than
one of the termination conditions set forth in this _Section 11.1_   are
applicable, the applicable Party shall have the right to choose the
termination condition or conditions pursuant to which this Agreement is to be
terminated.

 

Section 11.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this  Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_ , written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party
and Buyer shall return to Seller  or destroy all documents, work papers and
other materials of Seller relating to the Business and to the Transactions,
whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_ , no Party to this
Agreement shall have any Liability under this Agreement to any other Party

for Fraud or for Willful Breach by such Party; it being understood and agreed
that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Article XI_ , and _Article XIII_
(except for _Section 13.3_ and _Section 13.11_ ) hereof and all provisions of
this Agreement necessary for the interpretation and enforcement thereof shall
remain in full force and effect following such termination (and all  other

12.4_ or _Section 12.5_ , as the case may be, within the applicable survival
period, the representations and warranties or covenants that are the subject
of such indemnification  claim (and the right to pursue such claim) shall
survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is finally
resolved. It is the intention of the Parties that the survival periods and
termination dates set forth in this _Section 12.1_ supersede any statute of
limitations applicable to such representations and warranties and covenants or
any claim with respect thereof.

of  any Losses in respect of any breach or inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement, any express qualifications or
limitations set forth in such representation or warranty as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or  other words of similar import contained therein
shall be disregarded; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that this clause (c) shall
not apply to, and such qualifications and limitations shall not be disregarded
for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred or the amount of
Losses in respect of any such breach with respect to, any breach or 
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5(a)_
(Material Adverse Effect), _Section 4.5(b)_ (Conduct of Business), _Section
4.6(a)_ (Financial Statements) or _Section 4.6(c)_ (Undisclosed Liabilities).

 

Section 12.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. (a) From and after the Closing and
subject to the  provisions of this _Article XII_ , Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees,  agents, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect
of any and all Losses imposed  on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from:

 

 

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement or the certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)(iii)_ of this Agreement;

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement;

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 

 

 

(i) Seller shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ unless (A) the Losses for which Seller would be
responsible for such claim and all related claims exceed the De Minimis Amount
and (B) the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of  breaches of Seller's
representations and warranties (excluding all Losses associated with claims
less than the De Minimis Amount) exceeds the Deductible, in which event Seller
shall be liable solely for Losses in excess of the Deductible up to  the Cap;
and

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Seller's aggregate liability for indemnification under _Section
12.2(a)(i)_ shall in no  event exceed $13,500,000 (the "Cap").

 

 

 

 

-64-  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the De Minimis  Amount, Deductible and Cap
shall not apply to Seller's indemnification obligations (a) arising out of,
relating to or resulting from Fraud by Seller with respect to Seller's 
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ , or (b) arising out
of, relating to or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy in a Seller
Fundamental Representation, and none of the foregoing shall count toward the
Deductible or the Cap.

subject to the  provisions of this _Article XII_ , Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors,  employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties," and each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and the  Seller Indemnified Parties, an "Indemnified
Party") from, against and in respect of any and all Losses imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered by  any of the Seller Indemnified Parties
arising out of or resulting from:

 

 

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement or the certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to _Section
3.2(b)(iii)_ of this Agreement;

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement;
or

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) any Assumed Liability.

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 

 

 

(i) Buyer shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section          12.3(a)(i)_ unless (A) the Losses for which
Buyer would be responsible for such claim and all related claims exceed the De
Minimis Amount and (B) the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of breaches
of Buyer's representations and  warranties (excluding all Losses associated
with claims less than the De Minimis Amount) exceeds the Deductible, in which
event Buyer shall be liable solely for Losses in excess of the Deductible up
to the Cap; and

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Buyer's aggregate liability for indemnification under _Section
12.3(a)(i)_   shall in no event exceed the Cap.

 

 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the De Minimis Amount, Deductible and Cap shall
not apply to Buyer's indemnification obligations (a) arising out of, relating

resulting from a breach or  inaccuracy in a Buyer Fundamental Representation,
and none of the foregoing shall count toward the Deductible or the Cap.

 

Section 12.4 _Third Party Claims_. (a) In the event that any claim or demand
for which an  indemnifying party (an "Indemnifying Party") may have Liability
to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be
collected from  any Indemnified Party by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten
(10) Business  Days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of a Third
Party Claim, notify the

 

 

-65-  

Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party Claim. Such notice (a "Claim
Notice") shall specify the section(s) of this Agreement that form the basis of
the claim for indemnification, the amount or the estimated amount of damages
sought under such Third Party  Claim (if known) and shall include all
material correspondence and documentation in the possession of the Indemnified
Party relating to such claim. After providing such notice, the Indemnified
Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably  informed with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to timely give a Claim
Notice, include any information in a Claim Notice, and to keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed shall  affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. Upon receipt of a
Claim  Notice, the Indemnifying Party may object to such claim and/or reserve
its rights under this Agreement in connection therewith, and any such
objection and/or reservation of rights shall not be deemed a repudiation of
this Agreement or any of  Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim and shall have the
sole power  to direct and control such defense with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that the  Indemnifying Party shall first
acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligation under and subject to
this _Article XII_; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
if (i) the Indemnified Party shall have one or more legal or equitable 
defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, and, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnified Party, counsel for the Indemnifying Party could not adequately
represent the interests  of the Indemnified Party because such interests
could be in conflict with those of the Indemnifying Party; (ii) such Third
Party Claim is reasonably likely, in the reasonable judgment of  the
Indemnified Party, to have a material effect on the Indemnified Party or the
Business or involve Losses beyond the scope  or limits of the indemnification
obligation of the Indemnifying Party; or (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall
not have assumed the defense of the litigation in a timely fashion (but in any
event within thirty (30) days of notice of such Third Party  Claim). Once the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate
in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its
own  cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim on a basis (i) that would result in the imposition of a consent order,
injunction, decree or  agreement that would restrict the future activity or
conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) that includes
a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any
Person by the Indemnified Party or any  of its Affiliates (iii) that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the
plaintiff of a full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates from all Liability with respect to the  matters that are subject
to such Third Party Claim or (iv) that provides for any payment by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates that is not fully covered by the
indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim within thirty (30) days of notice of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party  shall have the right to assume and control its own
defense. If the Indemnified Party assumes its own defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed as to the status of, and any material  developments related to, the
Third Party Claim, provide to the

 

 

-66-  

Indemnifying Party any documentation or information reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party relating to such Third Party  Claim, and shall consult
with the Indemnifying Party, and consider in good faith the Indemnifying
Party's views, with respect to the defense strategy and budget for such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not, without the written  consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which written consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), pay, compromise or settle any such Third
Party Claim, except that no such consent shall be required if, following a
written  request from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
fail, within fourteen (14) days after the making of such request, to
acknowledge and agree in writing that, if such Third Party Claim shall be
adversely determined, such Indemnifying  Party has an obligation to provide
indemnification hereunder to such Indemnified Party under and subject to this
_Article XII_.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, provide reasonable cooperation to the other party in all
aspects of any  investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial,
compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which the
Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ ,
including, but not limited to, by providing the other party with reasonable
access to books, records, employees and officers (including as witnesses) of
such party and its Affiliates; _provided_ , that neither party shall be
required to grant access or furnish information to the other party to the
extent that such information is subject to an  attorney-client, work product
or other applicable legal privilege; _provided_ , _further_ ,  that each
party and/or its counsel shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss or  waiver of attorney-client, work product or other
applicable legal privilege.

 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable  Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client, work product or other applicable
legal privilege.

 

Section 12.5 _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party desires to  make a
claim for indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a
Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall  notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Direct Claim. Such notice shall specify
the section(s) of this Agreement that form the basis of the Direct Claim for
indemnification, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought with
respect  to such Direct Claim (if known), any other remedy sought thereunder,
and any relevant time constraints relating thereto and shall include all
material correspondence and documentation in the possession of the
Indemnifying Party related to such  Direct Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to include any information in a Direct Claim shall affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure
has a prejudicial effect  on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Direct Claim. Upon receipt of notice
of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party may object to such claim and/or
reserve its rights under this Agreement in  connection therewith, and any
such objection and/or reservation of rights shall not be deemed a repudiation
of this Agreement or any of the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder.

 

 

-67-  

Section 12.6 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 

(a) _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._ The amount of any Loss for which 
indemnification is provided under _Section 12.2_ or _12.3_ shall be net of
(i)  any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification by, or indemnification agreement with, any third party that is
not an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party and (ii) any insurance proceeds or
other cash receipts  or sources of reimbursement received from any third
party that is not an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party as an offset against
such Loss (each third party that is not an Affiliate of such Indemnified Party
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), a  "Collateral Source"), in each case
net of reasonable costs of recovery and, if applicable, premium increases or 
adjustments. If the amount to be netted hereunder in connection with a
Collateral Source from any payment required under _Sections_ _12.2_ and _12.3_
is received after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise
required to  be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XII_ ,
the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after
such receipt, any  amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to
pay pursuant to this _Article XII_ had such receipt been made at or prior to
the time of such  indemnification payment.

 

(b) _Other Recovery_. The provisions of this _Article XII_ are not intended to
permit duplicate recoveries on the same Loss.

 

Section 12.7 _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES_. 
NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER FOR, AND LOSSES SHALL NOT
INCLUDE, ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGES; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT THE FOREGOING
SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE RECOVERY IN RESPECT OF (I) ANY LOSSES
INCURRED OR SUFFERED FROM THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS OR (II) ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGES
BASED SOLELY ON  THE CONDUCT OF THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY AWARDED BY A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL JUDGMENT NOT SUBJECT TO APPEAL.

 

Section 12.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying
Party  to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to _Section
12.2_ or Section _  12.3_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for all applicable Tax purposes.

 

Section 12.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims arising out of  or based
upon Fraud or as provided in _Section 3.3_ and _Section 13.11_ , from  and
after the Closing, the exclusive remedy for any Indemnified Party for
misrepresentations, breach of warranties or breach of covenants contained in
this Agreement, for any claim arising out of, relating to or based upon this
Agreement, or the  Transactions shall be the indemnification provided in this
_Article XII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, except for claims arising out
of or based upon Fraud or as provided in _Section 3.3_ and _Section 13.11_ ,
subject to the indemnification provided in this _Article XII_ , the Parties
hereby waive  and release, effective upon the occurrence of the Closing, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights,
claims and causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any),
whether at law or in equity, known or  unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which
exist or may arise in the future, that they may have against Seller, its
Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives, or Buyer, its Affiliates or
any of its or their Representatives, as the case may be,  arising out of,
relating to or based upon any latent or patent defects or physical conditions,

 

 

-68-  

any and all other acts, omissions, events, circumstances or matters regarding
this Agreement, the Business, the Acquired Assets,  the Assumed Liabilities
or the transactions contemplated hereby or any applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit the Buyer's, Seller's or other
Indemnified  Party's rights under _Section 3.3_ and _Section 13.11_ any
claims arising out of or based upon Fraud, or any claims or rights under the
Intellectual Property License  Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement
or the Transition Manufacturing Agreement.

 

Section 12.10 _Limitation of Set-Off_. Neither Party shall have any right to
set off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XII_
against any payment due pursuant to _Article II_ or under any  Ancillary
Agreement.

 

Section 12.11 _Duty to Mitigate_. Each Indemnified Party shall take
commercially  reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses, to the extent required
by applicable Law, after becoming aware of any event that
would          reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder; _provided_ , that such mitigation is not 
detrimental in any material respect to the Indemnified Party and any costs of
such mitigation shall be considered additional indemnifiable Losses hereunder;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to mitigate
pursuant to the terms  hereof shall only reduce the rights of the Indemnified
Party to recover for Losses to the extent of the Losses that would have been
avoided by such  required mitigation.

 

ARTICLE XIII 


 

  MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 13.1 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure  to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
permitted successors and assigns. No Party to this Agreement may assign or
delegate, by operation of law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights,
obligations or Liabilities under this Agreement  without the prior written
consent of the other Party, which any such Party may withhold in its absolute
discretion, except that Buyer may assign this Agreement or any of its rights
or obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates or to any  successor of all
or a portion of the Business without Seller's prior written consent (but with
written notice to Seller); _provided_ that any such permitted  assignment
shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 13.2 _Public Announcements_.  Neither Party nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall issue any press release or make any public
announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any  Party and any of their respective Affiliates may make any public
disclosure (a) it believes in good faith, upon advice of counsel, is required
by applicable Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly
traded securities (in which  case the disclosing Party or Affiliate will
provide reasonable advance notice, to the extent reasonably practicable, to
the other Party prior to making the disclosure and will in good faith consider
the reasonable comments of the other Party on  such disclosure) or (b) that
is substantially consistent with a prior press release or public announcement
made with the consent of the other Party.

 

 

-69-  

Section 13.3 _Confidentiality_. (a) Buyer and Seller agree that the
Confidentiality  Agreement shall, as of the Closing Date, be terminated and
of no further force and effect.

 

(b) Seller agrees that, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing (or,
with respect to trade secrets, the longest period of time  permitted under
Law), Seller and its Representatives shall keep confidential and shall not
disclose to any Person, or use (other than in respect of the discharge of
Excluded Liabilities), any Buyer Information. Seller and its Representatives
shall  exercise the same degree of care with respect to maintaining the
confidentiality of any Buyer Information that Seller exercises with respect to
similar types of its own proprietary information, but in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care,  except that if any Buyer Information is required
by Law or legal or administrative process to be disclosed, Seller shall
promptly (and in any event prior to making such disclosure, to the extent
permitted by Law) notify Buyer of such disclosure  requirement so that Buyer
or its Affiliates may seek a protective Order or other appropriate remedy. In
the event that no such protective Order or other remedy is obtained, or Buyer
does not waive compliance with this _Section 13.3(b)_ , and Seller or its
Representatives are nonetheless legally required to disclose such Buyer
Information, Seller or its Representatives, as the case may be, will furnish
only  that portion of the Buyer Information which Seller or Representative is
advised by counsel is legally required to be furnished and will give Buyer
written notice of the Buyer Information to be disclosed as far in advance as
reasonably practicable  and exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Buyer
Information. For purposes of this _Section 13.3(b)_ ,  the term "Buyer
Information" means (i) all  information, knowledge and data of Seller and its
Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing to the extent related to the
Business, the Acquired Assets, the Products and/or the Assumed Liabilities,
(ii) all information, knowledge and data  provided by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to Seller in connection with the Transactions other than any
information contemplated by clause (i), and (iii) all analyses, compilations,
forecasts, studies, interpretations, summaries, notes, data and  other
documents and materials (in any form or medium of communication, whether
written, oral, electronic or magnetic), whether prepared by Seller, its
Representatives or others, which contain, reflect or are generated from or
based upon, in whole  or in part, the information referred to in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this sentence, other than any such information that (A) only with
respect to (ii) above, is known to Seller prior to receipt thereof from Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, (B) is  disclosed to Seller by a third party which
has, or is reasonably believed by Seller to have, a legal right to make such
disclosure without requiring Seller to maintain the confidentiality thereof,
(C) is or becomes part of the public domain through  no fault of Seller, or
(D) is independently developed by or for Seller, without reliance on or
reference to any information contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii) of this
sentence.

 

(c) Buyer agrees that, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing (or,
with respect to trade secrets, the longest period of time  permitted under
Law), Buyer and its Representatives shall keep confidential and shall not
disclose to any Person, or use, any Seller Information. Buyer and its
Representatives shall exercise the same degree of care with respect to
maintaining the  confidentiality of any Seller Information that Buyer
exercises with respect to similar types of its own proprietary information,
but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care, except that if any
Seller Information is required by Law or  legal or administrative process to
be disclosed, Buyer shall promptly (and in any event prior to making such
disclosure, to the extent permitted by Law) notify Seller of such disclosure
requirement so that Seller or its Affiliates may seek a  protective Order or
other appropriate remedy. In the event that no such protective Order or other
remedy is

 

 

-70-  

obtained, or Seller does not waive compliance with this
_Section          13.3(c)_ , and Buyer or its Representatives are
nonetheless legally compelled to disclose such Seller Information, Buyer or
its Representatives, as the case may be, will furnish only that portion of the
Seller Information which Buyer  or its Representatives are advised by counsel
is legally required to be furnished and will give Seller written notice of the
Seller Information to be disclosed as far in advance as reasonably practicable
and exercise all reasonable efforts to  obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded the Seller Information. For purposes
of this _Section 13.3(c)_ , the term "Seller Information" means (i) all
information, knowledge and data provided in connection with the Transactions
by Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer to the  extent related to the Retained
Business, the Excluded Assets, the Retained Products and/or the Excluded
Liabilities, and (ii) the portion of such analyses, compilations, forecasts,
studies, interpretations, summaries, notes, data and other  documents and
materials (in any form or medium of communication, whether written, oral,
electronic or magnetic), whether prepared by Buyer, Buyer's Representatives or
others, which contain the information referred to in clause (i) of this
sentence,  other than any such information that (A) is known to Buyer prior
to receipt thereof from Seller or any of its Affiliates, (B) is disclosed to
Buyer by a third party which has, or is reasonably believed by Buyer to have,
a legal right to make such  disclosure without requiring Buyer to maintain
the confidentiality thereof, (C) is or becomes part of the public domain
through no fault of Buyer, or (D) is independently developed by or for Buyer,
without reliance on or reference to any  information related to the Retained
Business received from Seller or any of its Affiliates, or (E) constitutes
Buyer Information or is otherwise reasonably necessary for Buyer to conduct
the Business or discharge the Assumed Liabilities.

 

Section 13.4 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, and
except as  otherwise specified herein, including _Section 6.2(g)_ , each
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement
and the Ancillary  Agreements and with respect to the Transactions.

 

Section 13.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
or the  application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or  circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. Further, the Parties agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the  extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

Section 13.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, the 
Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including the Transfer
Documents after their execution and delivery hereunder) including any and all
Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits contain the entire agreement of the Parties
with respect to  the Transactions, superseding all negotiations, prior
discussions and preliminary agreements made prior to the date hereof. This
Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by an
instrument in writing signed by both  Seller and Buyer. No such supplement,
amendment or addition shall be evidence, in and of itself, that the
representations and warranties in the corresponding section are no longer true
and correct in all material respects.

 

Section 13.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is  solely for
the benefit of the Parties and, to the extent set forth herein, their
respective Affiliates and the Indemnified Parties,

 

 

-71-  

and no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to otherwise confer upon
any other third parties any remedy, Claim,  Liability, reimbursement or other
right.

 

Section 13.8 _Waiver_. The waiver by a Party of any breach of any of the
terms, covenants or  conditions of this Agreement or of any right or
privilege conferred by this Agreement shall not be construed as a subsequent
waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges or as a
waiver of any other terms, covenants,  conditions, rights or privileges. No
waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized
Representative of the waiving Party.

 

Section 13.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any Claim or controversy
arising out of or  relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the Laws of any  jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 

Section 13.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) Each Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property,
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware state court, or federal court of
the United States of America, in each case  sitting in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement delivered in connection 
herewith or the Transactions or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment
relating thereto, and each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (i)
agrees not to commence any such action, suit or proceeding except in such
courts; (ii)  agrees that any claim in respect of any such action, suit or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware state court or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, in such federal court; (iii) waives, to
the fullest extent it may  legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit
or proceeding in any such Delaware state or federal court; and (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by  applicable Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, suit or proceeding in
any such Delaware state or federal court. Each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be  conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 13.15_. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS IS LIKELY  TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT  AND ANY OF THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH  OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS,

 

 

-72-  

(C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE  MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13.10(b)_.

 

Section 13.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that  irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties  shall be entitled (without proof of actual damages or otherwise or
posting or securing any bond) to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, these  being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific performance
shall include the right of Seller to cause Buyer to cause the Transactions to
be consummated on the terms and subject to the  conditions and obligations
set forth in this Agreement. The Parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary  damages
would provide adequate remedy. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the right to specific performance and the other relief contemplated
herein is an integral part of the Transactions and without such right, none of
the Parties  would have entered into this Agreement.

 

Section 13.12 _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party represents and agrees
with each other that  it has been represented by or had the opportunity to be
represented by independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had
the full right and opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s),
that to the extent, if any, that it  desired, it availed itself of this right
and opportunity, that it or its authorized officers (as the case may be) have
carefully read and fully understand this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements in their entirety and have had them fully  explained to them by
such Party's respective counsel, that each is fully aware of the contents
thereof and their meaning, intent and legal effect, and that it or its
authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement
and  has executed this Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue
influence.

 

Section 13.13 _Bulk Transfers_. Buyer  waives compliance with the provisions
of all applicable Laws relating to bulk transfers in connection with the
transfer of the Acquired Assets.

 

Section 13.14 _Counterparts; Signature Pages_. The Parties may execute this
Agreement in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an 
original and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. Any signature page hereto delivered by facsimile
machine or by e-mail (including in portable document format (pdf), as a joint
photographic  experts group (jpg) file, or otherwise) shall be binding to the
same extent as an original signature page, with regard to any agreement
subject to the terms hereof or any amendment thereto and may be used in lieu
of the original signatures for all  purposes. Any Party that delivers such a
signature page agrees to later deliver an original counterpart to any Party
that requests it.

 

Section 13.15 _Notices_. All notices or other communications required  or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and may be delivered by
hand, by nationally recognized overnight courier (for delivery in no fewer
than two (2) Business Days), by facsimile or by email of a pdf document.
Except as provided otherwise herein, notices delivered by hand shall be deemed
given upon receipt; notices delivered by nationally recognized overnight
courier shall be deemed

 

 

-73-  

given upon receipt; notices delivered by facsimile shall be deemed given on
the date of the sender's receipt of confirmation  of successful transmission;
and notices delivered by email shall be deemed given on the date delivered. If
a notice deemed given upon receipt is given after 5:00 p.m. in the place of
receipt (the Parties understand and agree that the foregoing  applies only to
notice and not to copies), such notice will be deemed given on the next
succeeding Business Day. All notices shall be addressed as follows:

_Section 13.15_.

 

Section 13.16 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Cadwalader has been
engaged by Seller and its Affiliates to represent  it in connection with the
Transactions, Buyer hereby (i) waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause
its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts arising from Cadwalader's
representation of Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the
Transaction  that may arise after the Closing between Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, in a dispute between Buyer and Seller related to the Transactions, and
(ii) agrees that Cadwalader may  represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in
such dispute even though the interest of Seller may be directly adverse to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and even though Cadwalader may have
represented Buyer or any of its Affiliates in a matter  substantially related
to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. In addition, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates, further agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to  the contrary, as to all communications among any of Cadwalader, Seller or
any of Seller's Affiliates or any of their respective directors, managers,
members, partners, officers or employees or Affiliates that relate in any way
to this Agreement or  the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and shall be controlled
solely by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. Accordingly, Buyer shall not  have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Cadwalader relating to its engagement,
whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Notwithstanding those efforts,
Buyer, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, further  understands
and agrees that the consummation of the Transactions may result in the
inadvertent disclosure of such information that may be confidential or subject
to a claim of privilege. Buyer, on its behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates,  further understands and agrees that any disclosure of such
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will
not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege.
Buyer, on its behalf and on behalf of  its Affiliates, agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to return promptly any such inadvertently
disclosed information to the appropriate Person upon becoming aware of its
existence. Buyer agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to  take, all
steps reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this _Section 13.16_.
Recognizing that Sidley has been engaged by Buyer and its Affiliates to 
represent it in connection with the Transactions, Seller hereby (i) waives, on
its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts
arising from Sidley's representation of Buyer and its Affiliates in connection
with the  Transaction that may arise after the Closing between Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, in a dispute between Seller and Buyer related to the Transactions,
and (ii) agrees that  Sidley may represent Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
such dispute even though the interest of Buyer may be directly adverse to
Seller or any of its Affiliates, and  even though Sidley may have represented
Seller or any of its Affiliates in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Seller or any of its
Affiliates.
