     | (a) | the documents required or contemplated to be delivered by it

Arrangement becoming effective; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | written confirmation as to the satisfaction or waiver of all

---|---|--- ---|--- 

The Acquiror, the Company, the Parent and the Depositary shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
to any Person hereunder and from all distributions otherwise payable to any
Shareholder, Optionholder or Debentureholder such amounts as the Acquiror, the
Company, the Parent or the Depositary is required or permitted to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the Code or any
provision of any applicable federal, provincial, state, local or foreign Tax
law or other Applicable Law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes hereof as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority.



   2.10 | Dividends and Distributions 
---|--- 

If, on or after the date hereof, the Company declares, sets aside or pays any
dividend or other distribution (other than the Permitted Dividend) payable in
cash, securities, property or otherwise with respect to the Common Shares, or
sets a record date therefor that is prior to the Effective Time, then the
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect each such dividend or other
distribution by way of a reduction in the Consideration by an amount equal to
the amount of such dividend or distribution per Common Share.

 



   2.11 | Payment of Consideration 
---|--- 

Not more than one Business Day prior to the Effective Date, the Acquiror
shall provide the Depositary with sufficient funds in escrow (the terms and
conditions of such escrow to be satisfactory to the Parties) to pay the
aggregate Consideration for all of the Common Shares (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the unvested Restricted Shares with respect to which
Common Shares are issued in accordance with Section 2.3(a)(i)) to be acquired
pursuant to the Arrangement. The Depositary shall cause such funds to be (a)
held for the benefit of the Shareholders and (b) promptly applied to making
the payments provided for in the agreement with the Depositary. The Depositary
shall invest any cash in such escrow as directed by the Parent or the
Acquiror; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankerÂ’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Parent. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the amount held by the Depositary
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the cash payable to Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the amount lost through investments or
other events so as to ensure that the escrow fund is, at all times, maintained
at a level sufficient to make such payments. The Depositary shall deliver the
Consideration contemplated to be paid to Shareholders pursuant to  _Section
2.3(a)_ out of such escrow funds. The Parent or the Acquiror shall instruct
the Depositary, as soon as reasonably practicable after  the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days following
the Effective Time), to mail to each record holder of Common Shares, which at
the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Common Shares shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Common Shares to the Depositary, and shall contain instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of such Common Shares in exchange for the
Consideration (the "Letter of Transmittal")). Upon surrender for cancellation
to the Depositary of its, his or her Common Shares, together with the Letter
of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, the holder of such Common
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Consideration
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, and any
Common Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If any portion of
the Consideration is to be paid to any person other than the person in whose
name the applicable surrendered Common Share is registered, it shall be a
condition to the payment thereof that the surrendered Common Share be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment of the
Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of
such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Common Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Depositary that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.11_,
each Common Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Consideration upon such surrender.
Except for interest required to be paid under Applicable Laws in respect of
Dissent Shares, no interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Common Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or
the Plan of Arrangement.

   6.3 | Responding to Acquisition Proposals and Superior Proposals 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Notwithstanding _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.1(b)_ , if after
the date hereof and prior to obtaining the approval of the Arrangement
Resolution from the requisite Shareholders at the Meeting, provided that
the Company is then in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement,
the Company receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that provides
for consideration per Common Share that is greater than the Consideration and
that was not solicited after the date hereof, the Board shall be permitted to
engage in discussions or negotiations, and provide information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal for the purpose of explaining or supplementing the CompanyÂ’s due
diligence materials, if and only to the extent that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Company has provided the Acquiror with the notice
required by _Section 6.2_ in respect of such Acquisition Proposal and with at
least 48 hours prior written notice of its decision to engage in any
such discussions or negotiations or to provide any such information; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Laws; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | prior to providing any information or data, the Board
receives from such Person an executed non-disclosure and standstill agreement
that contains provisions that are not less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and not more favorable to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal than those which apply to the
Acquiror under the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Company sends an
executed copy of any such non-disclosure agreement to the Acquiror promptly
upon its execution and prior to any non-public information being provided to
such Person; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | prior to providing any information or data that has not
been provided to the Parent, the Company provides such information to the
Parent; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | the Acquiror is provided promptly with a list of any
information provided to such Person; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | access to information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries in respect of one or more Acquisition Proposals made by that
Person or persons acting jointly or in concert with such Person shall not
continue for a period in excess of thirty days in the aggregate. 
---|---|--- Company may (i) enter into an agreement (in addition to a confidentiality
agreement contemplated by _Section 6.3(a)(iii)_) with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal, and/or (ii) withdraw,
modify or qualify its approval or recommendation of the Arrangement and
recommend or approve an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal,
provided in each case:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Meeting has not occurred and the Company shall have
complied with all of its obligations under this _Article 6_ (including having
provided the Acquiror with the notice required by _Section 6.2_ in respect
of such Acquisition Proposal); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the Company has delivered written notice to the Acquiror
of the determination of the Board that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal and of the intention of the Board to approve or recommend such
Superior Proposal and the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, together with a copy of such agreement and all other
documentation comprising the Acquisition Proposal to the extent not previously
provided and all documentation relating to the CompanyÂ’s valuation of any
non-cash consideration included in the Acquisition Proposal (the "Superior
Proposal Notice"); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | at least five Business Days have elapsed since the date the
Superior Proposal Notice was received by the Acquiror, which five Business Day
period is referred to herein as the "Match Period";  
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | if the Acquiror has offered to amend the provisions of the
Arrangement and this Agreement during the Match Period pursuant to _Section
6.3(c)_, the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal compared to the Arrangement and this Agreement as proposed to be
amended by the Acquiror as of immediately prior to the termination of the
Match Period; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.1(e)_ and the Company concurrently makes the Termination Payment to the
Acquiror (with the receipt by the Acquiror of such Termination Payment being
a condition to the effectiveness of any such termination). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | During the Match Period, the Parent and the Acquiror shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the provisions of
the Arrangement and this Agreement. The Company shall cooperate with the
Parent and the Acquiror with respect to any such offer and shall negotiate in
good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the 
---|---|--- related transactions on such adjusted terms. The Board shall review any such
offer by the Acquiror or the Parent to amend the provisions of the
Arrangement and this Agreement in order to determine whether the AcquirorÂ’s
or the ParentÂ’s offer to amend the provisions of the Arrangement and this
Agreement, upon its acceptance, would result in the Acquisition Proposal
ceasing to be a Superior Proposal compared to the amendment to the provisions
of the Arrangement and this Agreement offered by the Acquiror or the Parent.
If the Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal, the
Company, the Parent and the Acquiror shall enter into an amendment to this
Agreement reflecting the offer by the Acquiror or the Parent to amend the
provisions of the Arrangement and this Agreement. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board from
responding through a directorsÂ’ circular or otherwise as required by
Applicable Laws to an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a
Superior Proposal, including to the extent the Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
to the Shareholders under Applicable Law. In addition, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2 under the 1934 Act or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934
Act; _provided_ that, in the case of a disclosure pursuant to (A) clause (i)
of this paragraph that is not a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act or (B) the first
sentence of this paragraph, the Board shall expressly reaffirm its
recommendation of the Arrangement in such disclosure unless its approval or
recommendation has been withdrawn, modified or qualified in accordance with
_Section 6.3(b)_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | If the Company provides the Acquiror with a Superior
Proposal Notice on a date that is less than five Business Days prior to the
Meeting, the Company will, at the request of the Acquiror, adjourn the Meeting
to a date specified by the Acquiror that is not less than five Business Days
and not more than 10 Business Days after the date the Superior Proposal Notice
is provided to the Acquiror. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | Each successive modification of any Acquisition Proposal
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section 6.3(b)_
and all of the provisions of _Section 6.3(b)_ shall apply again to such new
Acquisition Proposal. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

The Board will promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement
Resolution and the Arrangement by press release after any of (i)
an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or made and the Board
determines it is not a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Board determines that a
proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement pursuant to _Section
6.3(c)_ would result in an Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal
when assessed against the Arrangement as it is proposed to be amended as of
immediately prior to the 

---|---|--- of a Superior Proposal, the Acquiror, acting reasonably, requests
reaffirmation of such recommendation by the Board. The Parent and the
Acquiror will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
form and content of any such press release. 
---|--- 



     | (h) | The Company shall ensure that its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives are aware of the provisions of this _Article 6_ , and
the Company shall be responsible for any breach of this _Article 6_ by
such Subsidiaries and Representatives as if such Subsidiaries and
Representatives were parties hereto agreeing to the same restrictions as the
Company.

Subject to Applicable Laws, the Company shall and, where appropriate, shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, effect such reorganizations of the
business, operations and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or such
other transactions as the 

---|---|--- Reorganization"), and co-operate with the Acquiror and its advisors in order
to determine the nature of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization that might be
undertaken and the manner in which they might most effectively be undertaken;
_provided_ , however, that the Company shall not be required to carry out any
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization which: (i) would impede or materially delay
the completion of the Arrangement; (ii) would expose the Company (in the event
the Arrangement is not completed) to additional adverse Tax consequences that
it would not otherwise be exposed to in the absence of completing the Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization; (iii) would require the Company or any of its

time as may be agreed to by the Acquiror. The Acquiror acknowledges and agrees

capital properties owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement or acquired by such entities subsequent to the date of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without first

reasonably required by the Acquiror in this regard on a timely basis and to
assist in the obtaining of any such information in order to facilitate a
successful completion of such transactions or any such other reorganizations
or transactions as is reasonably requested by the Acquiror.

connection therewith, the Board shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to adjust the terms of all outstanding
Options, whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the
Effective Time, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to
receive the cash payment described in _Section 2.3(b)_ of this Agreement and
make such other changes to the Option Plan and any other applicable benefit
plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as the Company and Parent may
agree are appropriate to give effect to the Arrangement on the terms
set forth herein and in the Plan of Arrangement. In addition, the Board shall
take such actions as may be required to terminate the RSP Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Date. The Company shall ensure that following the
Effective Time, no holder of Options or other stock-based awards (or former
holder of any Option or other stock-based award) or any current or former
participant in any benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates
(including pursuant to the RSP Plan) shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
other equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock, "phantom" stock
rights, stock appreciation rights or stock based performance units).

to the extent the same is within its control and to consummate and make
effective as promptly as is practicable the transactions contemplated herein
and (b) for the discharge by each party of its respective obligations under

including its obligations under Applicable Laws, in each case including the

time, as and when reasonably requested by any Party, the other Party shall

provided such documents, instruments or actions are consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement and accepted industry practices. All such
further documents, instruments or actions shall be delivered or taken at no

other Party with a draft of that release at least one Business Day prior to
its release to enable the other Party to review that draft and advise of any
comments it may have with respect thereto. The Party proposing to make the
press release will not unreasonably refuse to incorporate the requested
changes in the public announcement except to the extent its counsel advises
that doing so will result in non-compliance with Applicable Law. The Company
will file such press release, together with a material change report
in prescribed form, with applicable Government Authorities in each province

   10.3 | Acknowledgement 
---|--- 

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in  _Section
10.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the Termination Payment and
the Reverse Termination Payment set out in _Section 10.2_ are payments of
liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the
Parent or the Company, as applicable, will suffer or incur as a result of the
event giving rise to such payment and the resulting termination of this
Agreement and are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right that
it may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are
excessive or punitive. Each Party agrees that the payment of the Termination
Payment or Reverse Termination Payment, as applicable, in accordance with
_Section 10.2_ is the sole monetary remedy of such Party in respect of the
event giving rise to the payment (subject to  _Section 10.2(d)_). The
Parties shall also have the right to injunctive relief and other equitable
relief in accordance with _Section 10.4_ to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce compliance with the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.3_
shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for willful, knowing or
intentional breach.

 



   10.4 | Remedies 
---|--- 

Subject to _Section 10.3_, the parties acknowledge and agree that an award of
money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any
party or its Representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching
party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties agree that, in the event of
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the
non-breaching party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting
a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and
specific performance. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for
any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity to each of the parties. ---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, other than with respect to
an intentional or willful breach, in no event shall a party hereto be liable
for damages or losses in respect of the covenants, agreements,
representations, warranties and indemnities contained in this Agreement or in
any certification, agreement or other document furnished pursuant to this
Agreement which are consequential, indirect or punitive damages or losses
(including any special or incidental loss of any kind and any lost profits)
suffered, sustained, paid or incurred by another party or its respective
Representatives.



   10.6 | Effect of Termination 
---|--- 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect without liability of any Party (or any
shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative
of such Party) to any other Party hereto, except that the provisions of this 
_Section 10.6_, _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_, _Section 10.4_, _Section
10.5_, _Section 11.3_, _Section 11.4_, _Section 11.6_ and _Section 11.8_
(including all related definitions set forth herein and any related
provisions necessary to give effect to such surviving provisions) shall
survive such termination.

holders of Common Shares cash with the Depositary in the aggregate amount
equal to the payments in respect thereof required by _Section 2.2(d)_ of
this Plan of Arrangement, with the amount per Common Share in respect of which
Dissent Rights have been exercised being deemed to be the Consideration per
Common Share for this purpose, net of applicable withholdings. The cash

---|---|--- certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Common Shares that were transferred pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_, together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the Shareholder represented by such surrendered certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to
such holder, the cash which such holder has the right to receive under the
Arrangement for such Common Shares less any amounts withheld pursuant to
_Section 4.4_, and any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 4.1(c)_,
each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Common Shares shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender a cash payment in lieu of such
certificate as contemplated in this _Section 4.1_, less any amounts withheld
pursuant to _Section 4.4_. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | No holder of Common Shares or Options shall be entitled to
receive any consideration with respect to such Common Shares or Options other
than any cash payment to which such holder is entitled to receive in

certainty, no such holder will be entitled to receive any interest, dividends,
premium or other payment in connection therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



   4.2 | Lost Certificates 
---|--- 

In the event that any certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective

of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, cash deliverable in accordance
with such holderÂ’s Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment and
delivery in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
Person to whom such cash is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to
the delivery of such cash, give a bond satisfactory to the Acquiror and the
Depositary in such sum as the Acquiror may direct, or otherwise indemnify the
Parent and the Acquiror in a manner satisfactory to the Parent and the
Acquiror, against any claim that may be made against the Parent or the
Acquiror in respect of the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.



   4.3 | Extinction of Rights 
---|--- 

Subject to any applicable laws governing unclaimed personal property, if
any Shareholder fails for any reason to deliver to the Depositary for
cancellation the certificates formerly representing Common Shares (or an
affidavit of loss and bond or other indemnity pursuant to _Section 4.2_),
together with such other documents or instruments required to effect the
transfer of Common Shares, on or before the last Business Day before the third
anniversary of the Effective Date, such Shareholder shall be deemed to have
donated and forfeited to the Acquiror any cash, net of  any applicable withholding or other taxes, held by the Depositary in trust
for such Shareholder to which such Shareholder is entitled. At and after the
Effective Time, any certificate formerly representing Common Shares shall
represent only the right to receive the consideration provided in _Section
2.2_ or _Section 3.1_ in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement; provided
that such certificates shall, on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date,
cease to represent a claim of any nature whatsoever and shall be deemed to
have been surrendered to the Acquiror and shall be cancelled.



   4.4 | Withholding Rights 
---|--- 

The Company, the Acquiror and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Shareholder or
Optionholder such amounts as the Company, the Acquiror or the Depositary, as
applicable, determines, acting reasonably, are required or permitted to deduct
and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the Code or any
provision of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or foreign Tax law
or other Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid
to the Shareholder or Optionholder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

 



   4.5 | No Liens 
---|--- 

Any exchange or transfer of securities pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement
shall be free and clear of any Encumbrances.



   4.6 | Paramountcy 
---|--- 

From and after the Effective Time: (a) this Plan of Arrangement shall take
precedence and priority over any and all Common Shares and options (including
the Options) issued or outstanding prior to the Effective Time, (b) the rights
and obligations of the holders of Common Shares and Options, the Company, the
Acquiror, the Acquiror, the Depositary and any transfer agent or other
depositary therefor in relation thereto, shall be solely as provided for in
this Plan of Arrangement, and (c) all actions, causes of action, claims or
proceedings (actual or contingent and whether or not previously asserted)
based on or in any way relating to any Common Shares or Options shall be
deemed to have been settled, compromised, released and determined without
liability except as set forth in this Plan of Arrangement.
