Reverse Termination Payment set out in <U>Section&nbsp;10.2</U> are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Parent or the Company, as applicable, will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving
rise to such payment and the resulting termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. Each Party agrees
that the payment of the Termination Payment or Reverse Termination Payment, as applicable, in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;10.2</U> is the sole monetary remedy of such Party in respect of the event giving rise to the payment (subject to
<U>Section&nbsp;10.2(d)</U>). The Parties shall also have the right to injunctive relief and other equitable relief in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;10.4</U> to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.3</U> shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for willful, knowing or intentional breach. </P>
