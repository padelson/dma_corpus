Section 2.01

|

|

The Sale; Closing. 

(a)Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at
the Closing, the Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to
Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Sellers, all
rights, title and interests in and to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens
(the "Sale"). Each Seller by its agreement hereunder waives its pre-emption
rights under any agreement binding the Sellers in respect of the Sale of the
Shares to the Buyer.

(b)In full payment for the Shares of the Sellers that do not constitute

(including Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section 2.06, Article 11 and Article
12), each Seller shall be entitled to receive the following consideration:

(i)an amount of cash and/or Buyer Shares equal to the (A) Closing Per Share
Consideration Value multiplied by (B) the number of Shares that do not
constitute Restricted Shares owned by such Seller, as set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet;

(ii)an amount of cash and/or Buyer Shares equal to such Seller's Pro Rata
Share of the Holdback Funds (to the extent released to the Equityholders as
provided herein), as set forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet;

(iii)an amount of cash and/or Buyer Shares equal to such Seller's Pro Rata
Share of any Shortfall Consideration (to the extent payable to the
Equityholders as provided herein), as set forth on the Consideration
Spreadsheet; and

(iv)an amount of cash equal to such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount (to the extent released to the
Equityholders as provided herein), as set forth on the Consideration
Spreadsheet.

(c)In full payment for the Restricted Shares, and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement (including Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section
2.06), each Restricted Shareholder shall be entitled to receive a number of
Buyer Shares equal to the (A) the number of Restricted Shares owned by such
Restricted Shareholder multiplied by (B) the Per Share Consideration Value
divided by (C) the Buyer Stock Price, as set forth on the Consideration
Spreadsheet, and the Buyer Shares issued to such Restricted Shareholders shall
remain subject to the Restricted Share Agreement applicable to the related
Restricted Shares in all respects.

(d)The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place electronically by exchange of PDF copies of
documents, unless Applicable Laws governing the Sale require otherwise. The
Closing shall be carried out on the date hereof (at a time and place to be
agreed by the parties), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the last of
the conditions set forth in Article 9 to be satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject 

to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), and otherwise on a date to
be agreed by the parties that is no later than third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in Article 9 to
be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions). The date on which the Closing actually takes place is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date." Unless otherwise
explicitly specified, all transactions taking place at the Closing shall be
deemed to occur simultaneously.

Section 2.02

Closing Working Capital Adjustment. 

(a)Pre-Closing Estimate. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Buyer the Company's good-faith estimate of each of (A) Closing Cash, (B)
Closing Indebtedness, (C) Closing Working Capital and (D) Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses, such estimates to be prepared in accordance with (x) the
same accounting principles and methods the Company has used to produce the
Company's most recent Financial Statements (to the extent consistent with
SFRS) and (y) the illustration set forth on Schedule 2.02(a). The Company
shall deliver all relevant backup materials and schedules, in detail
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, concurrently with the delivery of such
estimates and the Allocation Schedule. Based on such estimates and prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall reasonably and in good faith
calculate estimates of Closing Cash ("Estimated Closing Cash"), Closing
Indebtedness ("Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), Closing Working Capital
("Estimated Closing Working Capital") and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
("Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses"), which estimates shall be
used to determine the Estimated Total Consideration Value for purposes of the
Closing.

(b)Post-Closing Adjustment.

(i)As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 90 calendar days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared in accordance
with the Specified Accounting Principles, and delivered to the Equityholder
Representative an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing
(the "Closing Balance Sheet"), together with a statement (the "Buyer Closing
Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Buyer's calculation of each of
(i) Closing Cash, (ii) Closing Indebtedness, (iii) Closing Working Capital,
(iv) Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and (v) the Total Consideration Value
and attaching all relevant backup materials and schedules.

(ii)From and after the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Buyer
Closing Statement, Buyer shall provide the Equityholder Representative and any
accountants or advisors retained by the Equityholder Representative with
reasonable access to the books and records of the Acquired Companies and cause
appropriate representatives of Buyer and the Acquired Companies to be
reasonably available to discuss the Closing Balance Sheet and the Buyer
Closing Statement and respond to reasonable questions of the Equityholder
Representative and its accountant with regard thereto, solely for the purposes
of: (A) enabling the Equityholder Representative and its accountants and
advisors to calculate and to review Buyer's calculations as reflected Buyer
Closing Statement and (B) identifying any dispute related to the calculations
set forth in the Buyer Closing Statement.

(iii)If the Equityholder Representative disputes the calculation of Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital, Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses or the Total Consideration Value set forth in the Buyer
Closing Statement, then the Equityholder Representative shall deliver a
written notice (an "Adjustment Dispute Notice") to Buyer during the 30-day
period commencing upon receipt by the Equityholder Representative of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Buyer Closing Statement (the "Review Period").
The Adjustment Dispute Notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
for the dispute of such calculation.

(iv)If the Equityholder Representative does not deliver an Adjustment Dispute
Notice to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer's
calculations of each of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working
Capital, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and the Total Consideration Value
shall be deemed final and binding on Buyer, the Equityholder Representative
and the Equityholders for all purposes of this Agreement. 

(v)If the Equityholder Representative delivers an Adjustment Dispute Notice to
Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period with respect to Buyer's
calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital,
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses or the Total Consideration Value, then the
Equityholder Representative and Buyer shall meet, confer and exchange any
additional relevant information reasonably requested by the other party
regarding the computation of such disputed items for a period of 30 calendar
days after the end of the Review Period, and use reasonable efforts to resolve
by written agreement (the "Agreed Adjustments") any differences as to such
disputed items. In the event Buyer and the Equityholder Representative so
resolve any such differences, Buyer's calculations set forth in the Buyer
Closing Statement, as adjusted by the Agreed Adjustments, shall be final and
binding for purposes of this Agreement. If the Equityholder Representative and
Buyer are unable to reach agreement on any disputed item within the 30
calendar day period, then either the Equityholder Representative or Buyer may
submit the objections to the objections to the New York office of an
internationally recognized independent accounting firm (such firm, or any
successor thereto, being referred to herein as the "Designated Accounting
Firm") after such 30th day. The Designated Accounting Firm shall be directed
by Buyer and the Equityholder Representative to resolve the unresolved
objections as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with the
Specified Accounting Principles, and, in any event, within 45 calendar days of
such referral, and, upon reaching such determination, to deliver a copy of its
calculations (the "Expert Calculations") to the Equityholder Representative
and Buyer. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the
Designated Accounting Firm, each of Buyer, the Equityholder Representative and
their respective advisors and accountants shall have a reasonable opportunity
to meet with the Designated Accounting Firm to provide their respective views
as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital, Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses or the Total Consideration Value. The determination of Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital, Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses or the Total Consideration Value (as applicable) made by the
Designated Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on Buyer, the
Equityholder Representative and the Equityholders for all purposes of this
Agreement, absent manifest error. In calculating Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and
the Total Consideration Value (as applicable), the Designated Accounting Firm
shall be limited to addressing only the particular disputes referred to in the
Adjustment Dispute Notice. The Expert Calculations (A) shall reflect in detail
the differences, if any, between the disputed items reflected therein and the
disputed items set forth in the Buyer Closing Statement, and (B) with respect
to any specific discrepancy or disagreement, shall be no greater than the
higher amount calculated by Buyer or the Equityholder Representative, as the
case may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by Buyer or the
Equityholder Representative, as the case may be. The fees and expenses of the
Designated Accounting Firm shall be paid by Buyer and the Equityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders) in inverse proportion as they
may prevail (based on the disputed items as resolved by the Designated
Accounting Firm as compared to the disputed items proposed by Buyer and the
Equityholder Representative, respectively), as determined by the Designated
Accounting Firm. For example, if Equityholder Representative claims that the
appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer
and if the Designated Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding to the Equityholder Representative $300 of the $1,000 contested, then
the fees, costs and expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm shall be
allocated thirty percent (30%) (i.e., 300 divided by 1,000) to Buyer and
seventy percent (70%) (i.e., 700 divided by 1,000) to the Equityholder
Representative.

(vi)If the Total Consideration Value, as finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.02, is less than the Estimated Total Consideration Value (such
amount, "Excess Consideration"), then such Excess Consideration shall be
satisfied by forfeiture by the Equityholders of Holdback Funds in an amount
equal to the Excess Consideration (with each Equityholder forfeiting cash and
Buyer Shares (x) in an amount equal to such Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of
such Excess Consideration, (y) in the same ratio of cash to Buyer Shares as
such Equityholder received as part of such Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of
the Estimated Total Consideration Value and (z) with Buyer Shares being valued
at the Buyer Stock Price); provided, however, in the event that the Holdback
Funds are 

insufficient to satisfy the Excess Consideration, each Equityholder shall pay
to Buyer in cash such Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of the excess of such
Excess Consideration over the value of the Holdback Funds. If the Total
Consideration Value, as finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.02, is greater than the Estimated Total Consideration Value (such amount,
"Shortfall Consideration"), then Buyer shall cause such Shortfall
Consideration to be paid promptly to the Equityholders in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Share of such Shortfall Consideration as set forth in the
Consideration Spreadsheet.

Treatment of Company Options. 

(a)At the Closing, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Closing shall vest in full (to the extent then-unvested), and shall
automatically be canceled and converted solely into the right to receive,
subject to and conditioned upon the holder's timely execution and delivery to
the Company of an Option Acknowledgement and further subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including with respect to deductions and
withholding and to Section 2.04(a), Section 2.06 and Article 11), (i) an
amount in cash (the "Closing Option Consideration") equal to (A) the excess of
the Per Share Consideration Value over the per-share exercise price of such
Company Option, multiplied by (B) the aggregate number of Company Ordinary
Shares underlying such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Closing,
less (C) such Award Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Holdback Funds Value and
the Equityholder Representative Expense Amount, and (ii) such Award Holder's
Pro Rata Share, to be paid in cash, of (A) the Holdback Funds Value and
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount, if any, to be released pursuant to
this Agreement and (B) the Shortfall Consideration, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.02(b)(vi) (collectively, the amounts in clauses (i) and (ii), the
"Option Consideration"). The Buyer, in its discretion, shall either (a) pay
the Closing Option Consideration directly to Award Holders promptly following
the Closing or (b) cause the Closing Option Consideration to be remitted
through the payroll or accounts payable systems of the Acquired Companies on
the next payroll date at least three (3) Business Days following the Closing;
provided, that, in any event, the Closing Option Consideration shall be paid
to Award Holders not later than fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date,
subject to local payroll requirements.

(b)From and after the Closing, the holders of Company Options shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the
Option Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03(a) (if applicable). The
Option Consideration shall constitute the sole consideration payable in
respect of all canceled Company Options.

(c)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall notify, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D ("Option Acknowledgement"), each Award Holder of the
treatment as provided in Section 2.03(a) of all Company Options held by such
Award Holder and request that each such Award Holder holding Company Options
execute and return such Option Acknowledgement to the Company no later than
the Closing Date. No later than immediately prior to the Closing, the Company
shall terminate the Company ESOP. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take
all actions (including providing all notices, adopting all resolutions and
obtaining all consents and making any amendments) that may be necessary (under
the Company ESOP and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of Section
2.03(a) and to ensure that, from and after the Closing, Award Holders have no
rights with respect to the Company ESOP or Company Options other than those
specifically provided in this Section 2.03. Buyer shall be entitled to
reasonable advance review and approval of the Option Acknowledgement and any
other documentation contemplated by this Section 2.03(c) or as may otherwise
be required under each Company ESOP to give effect to this Section 2.03(c).

deliver or cause to be delivered or made available to Buyer the following in
connection with the Shares (collectively, the "Share Closing Deliverables"): 

(i)original share certificates in respect of the Shares;

(ii)valid share transfer forms (each, a "Share Transfer Form") in respect of
the Shares, duly executed by each of the Sellers in favor of Buyer;

(iii)a working sheet signed by a director or secretary of the Company
computing the net asset value per share of the Company and/or such other
document(s) as may be prescribed from time to time by the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore for the purpose of assessing the stamp duty payable on
the transfer of the Shares together with a certified copy of the relevant

(c)Closing Deposits. At or prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, each of the Sellers and Award Holders agree
and acknowledge that Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Exchange Agent,

(i)an amount in cash equal to the portion of the Aggregate Closing Cash
Consideration payable to the Sellers in accordance with the Consideration
Spreadsheet (which amount accounts for the deductions in connection with the
Escrow Cash and Equityholder Representative Expense Amount, as described in
Section 2.04(d) and Section 2.04(e), respectively);

(ii)the Aggregate Closing Share Consideration payable to the Sellers in
accordance with the Consideration Spreadsheet (which number of Buyer Shares
accounts for the deduction in connection with the Holdback Shares, as
described in Section 2.04(d)) duly and validly issued by the Buyer to the
applicable Sellers in accordance with the Consideration Spreadsheet; and

(iii)certified true copies of the resolutions passed by the Buyer's board of
directors: (A) approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(B) authorizing the issuance of the Aggregate Share Consideration, in the case
of each of (A) and (B), in accordance with, and subject to the conditions of,
this Agreement.

(d)Holdback Funds. At the Closing, (i) the Holdback Shares shall be issued,
but not distributed, and the Holdback Shares shall be withheld from the
Aggregate Share Consideration otherwise payable hereunder to the Equityholders
(in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) as set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Escrow
Agent, an amount equal to the Escrow Cash to be held in an escrow account (the
"Escrow Account") in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, which Escrow Cash
shall be deducted from the Aggregate Cash Consideration otherwise payable
hereunder to the Equityholders (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares) as set forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet. The Holdback Shares and
Escrow Cash shall be held by Buyer and the Escrow Agent, respectively, and
constitute partial security for any Excess Consideration, if applicable, and
the indemnification obligations of the Equityholder Indemnitors pursuant to
Article 11, and shall be held, distributed or restricted in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, the Vesting Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Except to the extent there is a forfeiture of Holdback Shares
pursuant to this Agreement and/or Buyer Shares pursuant to the Vesting
Agreement or the Restricted Share Agreements, such Buyer Shares shall be
treated by the Buyer as issued and outstanding Buyer Shares as of the Closing
which are registered in the name of the applicable Equityholder entitled to
such shares (subject to appropriate legends and restrictions on the books of
Buyer's transfer agent with respect to the restrictions imposed on such shares
under this Agreement, the Vesting Agreement and the Restricted Share
Agreements, as applicable).

(e)Equityholder Representative Expense Account. At the Closing, Buyer shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the Equityholder Representative
at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount to be held by the Equityholder
Representative (the "Equityholder Representative Expense Account") for
purposes of paying the expenses incurred by the Equityholder Representative in
fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement. 

(f)Exchange Procedures. Within two Business Days following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each Seller a letter of
transmittal and instructions in substantially the form attached as Exhibit E
hereto for use in the Sale. Upon delivery of the letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, in
exchange for each Seller's Shares, such Seller shall be entitled to receive
the consideration due to such Seller in accordance with the Consideration
Spreadsheet in connection with the Closing following the Closing. The Exchange
Agent shall use reasonable best efforts to make (and Buyer shall cause the
Exchange Agent use reasonable best efforts to make) the payments described in
the preceding sentence to each Seller in the method designated by such Seller
in the letter of transmittal within five Business Days following delivery of
the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, to the Exchange Agent.

(g)Transaction Costs. At or promptly following the Closing, Buyer shall pay,
or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Acquired Companies, the Estimated Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses (excluding Accrued Income Taxes) as to which
Invoices therefor (including wire instructions) have been provided to Buyer,
in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated in such Invoices. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company
Transaction Expenses paid by the Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.04(g) shall
be deemed Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses for purposes of this Agreement.

(h)Indebtedness. At or promptly following the Closing, the Buyer shall repay,

Agreement. The number of Buyer Shares which each Seller is entitled to receive
hereunder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Buyer Shares
(after aggregating, for each particular share certificate representing Shares,
all fractional Buyer Shares to be received by such Seller). In lieu of any
fractional Buyer Shares to which any Seller would otherwise be entitled (after
aggregating, for each particular share certificate representing Shares, all
fractional Buyer Shares to be received by such Seller), such Seller shall
receive an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Buyer Stock Price.

Section 2.05

Restrictions on Buyer Shares. 

The Buyer Shares issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be issued
in a transaction exempt from or not subject to registration under the
Securities Act (by reason of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rule 506
of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and/or
Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act) and therefore may not be
re-offered or resold other than in conformity with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and such other applicable rules and
regulations or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. All recipients of such
Buyer Shares either shall be "accredited investors" or not "U.S. Persons" as
such terms are defined in Regulation D and Regulation S, respectively. The
Buyer Shares to be issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be
"restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities
Act and may not be offered, sold, pledged, assigned or otherwise transferred
unless pursuant to (A) a registration statement with respect thereto is
effective under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or
(B) an exemption from such registration exists and either Buyer's transfer
agent receives an opinion of counsel to the holder of such securities, which
counsel and opinion are reasonably satisfactory to Buyer's transfer agent,
that such securities may be offered, sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in
the manner contemplated without an effective registration statement under the

party or any regulatory or other governmental body or official, foreign or
domestic, regarding the Processing of Personal Data, and no such complaint,
audit, proceeding, investigation or claim has been threatened in writing

(a)Each Acquired Company has duly and timely filed (taking into account any
valid extensions) with the appropriate Tax authorities all income and other
material Tax Returns required to be filed. All such Tax Returns are complete
and accurate in all material respects when filed. All Taxes due and owing by

Since the Balance Sheet Date, no Acquired Company has incurred any liability
for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent
with past custom and practice.

(c)No deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any Acquired Company have been
claimed, proposed or assessed in writing by any Tax authority or other
Governmental Authority that have not been fully resolved. There are no pending
audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any liability in
respect of Taxes of any Acquired Company, nor has any been threatened in
writing. No issues relating to Taxes of any Acquired Company were raised by
the relevant Tax authority in any completed audit or examination that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability in respect of Taxes
in a later taxable period. No Acquired Company (or any predecessor thereof)
has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, nor has any
request been made in writing for any such extension or waiver.

(d)The Company has delivered or made available to Buyer complete and accurate
copies of all annual income and other material Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies (and any predecessor thereof) for all taxable years remaining open
under the applicable statute of limitations, and complete and accurate copies
of all audit or examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed
against or agreed to by any Acquired Company (or any predecessors thereof)
since January 1, 2016, or in relation to any taxable years remaining open
under Applicable Law. No power of attorney (other than powers of attorney
authorizing the ongoing tax advisor of the Acquired Companies to act on behalf
of the Acquired Companies) with respect to any Taxes has been executed or

Companies who is authorized to act on behalf of any Acquired Companies with
respect to any Taxes is identified on Section 3.18(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

301.7701-3 (or any similar provision of non-U.S. Tax law) has been filed with
respect to any Acquired Company.

(g)No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, Taxable income for any period (or any
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any installment
sale or other transaction on or prior to the Closing Date, any accounting
method change or agreement with any Tax authority prior to the Closing, the
use of an improper method of accounting for any period or portion thereof
ending prior to the Closing Date, any prepaid amount received on or prior to
the Closing or any intercompany transaction or excess loss account described
in Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local,
or non-U.S. Tax law), or any election under Section 108(i) of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law).

as defined in Section 957 of the Code or a "passive foreign investment
company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, or (ii) engaged in a
trade or business, had a permanent establishment (within the meaning of an
applicable Tax treaty) or otherwise become subject to Tax jurisdiction in a
country other than the country of its formation.

(i)No Acquired Company is a partner for Tax purposes with respect to any joint
venture, partnership, or other arrangement or Contract which is treated as a
partnership for Tax purposes.

(j)No Acquired Company is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity agreement,
Tax sharing agreement, Tax allocation agreement or similar Contract, other
than customary indemnification provisions in a commercial Contract entered
into in the ordinary course of business which Contract does not relate
primarily to Taxes.

(k)No Acquired Company has been a party to a transaction that is or is
substantially similar to a "reportable transaction," as such term is defined
in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1), or any other transaction
requiring disclosure under analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax
law. If any Acquired Company has entered into any transaction such that, if
the treatment claimed by it were to be disallowed, the transaction would
constitute a substantial understatement of U.S. federal income Tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code, then such Acquired Company, as the case
may be, believes that it has either (i) substantial authority for the tax
treatment of such transaction or (ii) disclosed on its Tax Return the relevant
facts affecting the tax treatment of such transaction. No Acquired Company has
participated or plans to participate in any Tax amnesty program.

(l)No Acquired Company has ever been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return. No Acquired Company has
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Taxes of such Acquired
Company), other than pursuant to customary indemnification provisions in a
commercial Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business which
Contract does not relate primarily to Taxes.

(m)Each Acquired Company has timely withheld and paid all Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
Service Provider and to any creditor, securityholders of such Acquired Company
or other Person. Sellers, the Acquired Companies and their respective
Affiliates have properly classified all Service Providers as employees or non-
employees for all purposes (including, without limitation, for purposes of the
Benefit Plans), and have made all required and appropriate filings and reports
in connection with services provided by, and compensation paid to, such
Service Providers.

(n)No Acquired Company or any of its predecessors has been, since January 1,
2016, a party to any distribution that the parties to which treated as
satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the Code (or any corresponding
provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law).

(o)The Company has provided or made available to Buyer all material
documentation relating to, and is in full compliance with all terms and
conditions of, any Tax exemption, Tax holiday, Tax incentive or other Tax

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not have any adverse
effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemption,
Tax holiday, Tax incentive or other Tax reduction agreement or order.

(p)No Acquired Company (i) is or was a "surrogate foreign corporation" within
the meaning of Section 7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code or is treated as a U.S.
corporation under Section 7874(b) of the Code; or (ii) was created or
organized in the United States such that such entity would be taxable in the
United States as a domestic entity pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 301.7701-5(a).

Section 3.19

|

|

Employees and Employee Benefit Plans. 

(a)Each Acquired Company has duly and timely filed (taking into account any
valid extensions) with the appropriate Tax authorities all income and other
material Tax Returns required to be filed. All such Tax Returns are complete
and accurate in all material respects when filed. All Taxes due and owing by
any Acquired Company (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) have been paid.
No Acquired Company is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by a Tax
authority or other Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where an Acquired
Company does not file Tax Returns that any such Acquired Company is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b)The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Companies did not, as of the Balance Sheet
Date, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
set forth on the face of the Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto).
Since the Balance Sheet Date, no Acquired Company has incurred any liability
for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent
with past custom and practice.

(c)No deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any Acquired Company have been
claimed, proposed or assessed in writing by any Tax authority or other
Governmental Authority that have not been fully resolved. There are no pending
audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any liability in
respect of Taxes of any Acquired Company, nor has any been threatened in
writing. No issues relating to Taxes of any Acquired Company were raised by
the relevant Tax authority in any completed audit or examination that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability in respect of Taxes
in a later taxable period. No Acquired Company (or any predecessor thereof)
has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, nor has any
request been made in writing for any such extension or waiver.

(d)The Company has delivered or made available to Buyer complete and accurate
copies of all annual income and other material Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies (and any predecessor thereof) for all taxable years remaining open
under the applicable statute of limitations, and complete and accurate copies
of all audit or examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed
against or agreed to by any Acquired Company (or any predecessors thereof)
since January 1, 2016, or in relation to any taxable years remaining open
under Applicable Law. No power of attorney (other than powers of attorney
authorizing the ongoing tax advisor of the Acquired Companies to act on behalf
of the Acquired Companies) with respect to any Taxes has been executed or
filed with any Tax authority, and the ongoing Tax advisor of the Acquired
Companies who is authorized to act on behalf of any Acquired Companies with
respect to any Taxes is identified on Section 3.18(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(e)There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of any Acquired
Company (other than statutory liens for current Taxes not yet due and
payable).

(f)No entity classification election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3 (or any similar provision of non-U.S. Tax law) has been filed with
respect to any Acquired Company.

(g)No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, Taxable income for any period (or any
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any installment
sale or other transaction on or prior to the Closing Date, any accounting
method change or agreement with any Tax authority prior to the Closing, the
use of an improper method of accounting for any period or portion thereof
ending prior to the Closing Date, any prepaid amount received on or prior to
the Closing or any intercompany transaction or excess loss account described
in Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, 

local, or non-U.S. Tax law), or any election under Section 108(i) of the Code
(or any corresponding provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law).

(h)No Acquired Company (i) is or has been a "controlled foreign corporation"
as defined in Section 957 of the Code or a "passive foreign investment
company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, or (ii) engaged in a
trade or business, had a permanent establishment (within the meaning of an
applicable Tax treaty) or otherwise become subject to Tax jurisdiction in a
country other than the country of its formation.

(i)No Acquired Company is a partner for Tax purposes with respect to any joint
venture, partnership, or other arrangement or Contract which is treated as a
partnership for Tax purposes.

(j)No Acquired Company is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity agreement,
Tax sharing agreement, Tax allocation agreement or similar Contract, other
than customary indemnification provisions in a commercial Contract entered
into in the ordinary course of business which Contract does not relate
primarily to Taxes.

(k)No Acquired Company has been a party to a transaction that is or is
substantially similar to a "reportable transaction," as such term is defined
in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1), or any other transaction
requiring disclosure under analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax
law. If any Acquired Company has entered into any transaction such that, if
the treatment claimed by it were to be disallowed, the transaction would
constitute a substantial understatement of U.S. federal income Tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code, then such Acquired Company, as the case
may be, believes that it has either (i) substantial authority for the tax
treatment of such transaction or (ii) disclosed on its Tax Return the relevant
facts affecting the tax treatment of such transaction. No Acquired Company has
participated or plans to participate in any Tax amnesty program.

(l)No Acquired Company has ever been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return. No Acquired Company has
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Taxes of such Acquired
Company), other than pursuant to customary indemnification provisions in a
commercial Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business which
Contract does not relate primarily to Taxes.

(m)Each Acquired Company has timely withheld and paid all Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
Service Provider and to any creditor, securityholders of such Acquired Company
or other Person. Sellers, the Acquired Companies and their respective
Affiliates have properly classified all Service Providers as employees or non-
employees for all purposes (including, without limitation, for purposes of the
Benefit Plans), and have made all required and appropriate filings and reports
in connection with services provided by, and compensation paid to, such
Service Providers.

(n)No Acquired Company or any of its predecessors has been, since January 1,
2016, a party to any distribution that the parties to which treated as
satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the Code (or any corresponding
provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law).

(o)The Company has provided or made available to Buyer all material
documentation relating to, and is in full compliance with all terms and
conditions of, any Tax exemption, Tax holiday, Tax incentive or other Tax
reduction agreement or order of a territorial government. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not have any adverse
effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemption,
Tax holiday, Tax incentive or other Tax reduction agreement or order.

(p)No Acquired Company (i) is or was a "surrogate foreign corporation" within
the meaning of Section 7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code or is treated as a U.S.
corporation under Section 7874(b) of the Code; or (ii) was created or
organized in the United States such that such entity would be taxable in the
United States as a domestic entity pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 301.7701-5(a).

(q)Each Acquired Company maintains contemporaneous documentation
substantiating the transfer pricing practices and methodology between such
Acquired Company and its Affiliates as required by Applicable Law, and such
transfer pricing is on arm's-length terms.

(r)No Acquired Company has participated in or cooperated with, or has agreed
to participate in or cooperate with, or is participating in or cooperating
with, any international boycott within the meaning of Section 999 of the Code. 

(s)Except as disclosed in Section 3.18(s) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Service Provider is subject to taxation in the United States.

(t)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with
another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will result in any "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law).

(u)There is no Contract, agreement, plan (including any Company Benefit Plan)
or arrangement which requires (i) any Seller or Affiliate thereof (other than
any Acquired Company) to pay a Tax gross-up or reimbursement payment to any
Service Provider or (ii) any Acquired Company to pay a Tax gross-up or
reimbursement payment to any Person.

Acquired Company) receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any Tax
Return of an Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including the pre-
Closing portion of a Straddle Period) with respect to which Buyer claims a
right to indemnification under this Agreement, then within thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice, Buyer shall notify the Equityholder
Representative of such notice; provided, however, that any failure on the part
of Buyer to so notify the Equityholder Representative shall not limit any of
the obligations of Sellers under Article 11 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Tax Contest). Buyer shall have the
right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided that
Buyer shall keep the Equityholder Representative reasonably informed of all
material developments and may not settle, compromise or resolve any such Tax
claim without the consent of the Equityholder Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. This Section 8.04,
and not Section 11.06, shall control with respect to Tax Contests.

similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
("Transfer Taxes") will be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer, on the one
hand, and fifty percent (50%) by the Equityholders (as a Company Transaction
Expense), on the other hand, regardless of the Person liable for such

applicable Governmental Authority or other third party; provided, the any
Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the exchange of Restricted Shares

the Acquired Companies filed with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
(ii) make any Tax election with respect to the Acquired Companies that has a

any corresponding provision of U.S. state and local Applicable Law with
respect to the Acquired Companies and the transactions contemplated hereunder,

Survival of Representations, Etc. 

(a)Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.01(f), the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Article 3 and in the Company Closing
Certificate and the representations and warranties made by each Seller in
Article 4 shall survive the Closing and expire on the date that is eighteen
(18) months after the Closing Date (the "General Expiration Date"); provided,
that the Fundamental Company Representations shall survive the General
Expiration Date and expire 90 days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any applicable extensions) (the "FR
Expiration Date"). The indemnification obligations under clauses (iv) and
(viii) of Section 11.02(a) shall survive until the General Expiration Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the General Expiration
Date or FR Expiration Date, as applicable, the Buyer delivers to the
Equityholder Representative in good faith a written notice which complies with
Section 11.04(a) alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any
representation or warranty and asserting a claim for recovery under Section
11.02 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in
such notice, and only such claim, shall survive the expiration of the
applicable time period until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved.

(b)Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.01(f), the Fundamental Buyer
Representations shall survive the Closing and expire on the FR Expiration
Date. All other representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein and
in any certificate or other writing delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto
shall not survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
prior to the FR Expiration Date the Equityholder Representative delivers, or
causes to be delivered, to the Buyer in good faith a written notice describing
in reasonable detail an inaccuracy in or a breach of any representation or
warranty and asserting a claim for recovery under Section 11.02 based on such
alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice, and only
such claim, shall survive the expiration of the applicable time period until
such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

(c)The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of each party to
this Agreement, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the
Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of
any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of,
any of the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

(d)The parties acknowledge and agree that if any of the Acquired Companies
suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages arising from or as
a result of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation set forth herein, then (without limiting any of the
rights of Buyer as an Indemnitee) Buyer shall also be deemed, by virtue of its
ownership of the stock of the Acquired Companies, to have incurred Damages as
a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach.

(e)All covenants and agreements contained herein shall survive the Closing and
will continue in accordance with their terms until such covenants and
agreements are fully performed and satisfied.

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 11.01(a) or
11.01(b), any representation or warranty made by a Seller, the Company or
Buyer in this Agreement or the Company Closing Certificate, as applicable,
shall survive the Closing indefinitely in the event of Fraud or Willful
Breach.

Indemnitees or to which any of the Buyer Indemnitees may otherwise become
subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third Party
Claim) and which arise from or as a result of:

(i)any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company under this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement; 

(ii)any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection
with the Closing as if such representation and warranty had been made on and
as of the Closing Date (except for such representations and warranties that
address matters only as of a particular time, which need only be accurate as
of such time);

(iii)any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company set forth in this
Agreement;

(iv)any Closing Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses, to the extent
not accounted for in the determination of the Total Consideration Value;

(v)any claims or threatened claims by or purportedly on behalf of any holder
or former holder of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
any Acquired Company (or rights to acquire shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of any Acquired Company) in such capacity, including any
claims or threatened claims by any such holder or former holder in such
capacity arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, actions taken by the Equityholder Representative (in its capacity as
the Equityholder Representative) and/or the allocation of the Total
Consideration Value, and any claims or threatened claims alleging violations
of fiduciary duty by any current or former director or officer of any Acquired
Company;

(vi)any inaccuracy contained in or failure of the Consideration Spreadsheet to
allocate the Total Consideration Value in accordance with the constituent
documents of the Acquired Companies, Applicable Law, this Agreement or any

purported or alleged holder of any Shares or Company Options challenging,
disputing or objecting to the amount of the Total Consideration Value received
or to be received by such current or former holder or purported or alleged
holder of any Shares or Company Options);

(vii)Indemnified Taxes; and

(viii)any items set forth on Schedule 11.02(a)(viii).

(b)From and after the Closing, each Seller shall hold harmless and indemnify

any Damages which are suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnitees or
to which any of the Buyer Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless
of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third Party Claim) and which
arise from or as a result of:

(i)any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by such
Seller (but not those made by any other Seller) under this Agreement as of the
date of this Agreement;

(ii)any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by such
Seller under this Agreement as of the Closing Date as if such representation
or warranty had been made as of the Closing Date (except for such
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
time, which need only be accurate as of such time); and

(iii)any breach of any covenant or agreement of such Seller (but not of any
other Seller) set forth in this Agreement.

(c)From and after the date hereof, the Buyer shall hold harmless and indemnify
each of the Equityholders from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each of the Equityholders for, any Damages which are suffered or incurred by
such Equityholder or other applicable Equityholder Indemnitees or to which
such Equityholder or other applicable Equityholder Indemnitees may otherwise
become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third
Party Claim) and which arise from or as a result of:

(i)any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Buyer Representations made
by the Buyer under this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement;

(ii)any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Buyer Representations made
by the Buyer under this Agreement as of the Closing Date as if such
representation or warranty had been made as of the Closing Date (except for
such representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular time, which need only be accurate as of such time); and 

(iii)any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 11.03

|

|

Limitations 

(a)The Equityholder Indemnitors shall not be required to make any
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i) and Section
11.02(a)(ii) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties of the Company under this Agreement until such time as the total
amount of all Damages (including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or
breach and all other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies in or
breaches of any representations or warranties) that have been directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Buyer Indemnitees,
or to which any one or more of the Buyer Indemnitees has or have otherwise
become subject, exceeds an amount equal to US$1,000,000 (the "Basket") in the
aggregate (it being understood that if the total amount of such Damages
exceeds the Basket, then the Buyer shall be entitled to be indemnified against
and compensated and reimbursed for all such Damages, including the amount of
the Basket); provided, however, that the Basket shall not apply to any Damages
related to inaccuracies or breaches of Fundamental Company Representations or
any Damages arising out of Fraud or Willful Breach.

(b)The maximum liability of the Equityholder Indemnitors, taken as a whole,
under Section 11.02(a)(i), Section 11.02(a)(ii) and clauses (iv) and (viii) of
Section 11.02(a) shall be equal to the Holdback Funds; provided, however, that
the foregoing limitation does not apply to any Damages (i) related to
inaccuracies or breaches of the Fundamental Company Representations (which
shall be capped at the Total Consideration Value) or (ii) with respect to
claims of, or arising out of Fraud or Willful Breach; provided, further, that
the Buyer shall recover all Damages subject to indemnification under Section
11.02 first from the Holdback Funds before the Buyer shall be entitled to
recover any Damages directly from any Equityholder Indemnitor. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, to the extent any
amounts are released from the Holdback Funds to the Buyer with respect to
claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement for which the
maximum liability of the Equityholder Indemnitors is not equal to the Holdback
Funds, such released amounts shall not reduce the amount that the Buyer may
recover with respect to claims for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement that are subject to the limitation set forth in this Section
11.03(b). The maximum liability of the Buyer Indemnitors for Damages under
Section 11.02(c) shall be equal to the Total Consideration Value, to the
extent not paid in the form of cash or validly issued shares of Buyer Common
Stock (valued based on the Buyer Stock Price) in accordance with the terms of,
and subject to the conditions in, this Agreement; provided, that payment of
any amounts in the form of cash or validly issued shares of Buyer Common Stock
shall not reduce the amount any Equityholder can recover for any breach or
inaccuracy of any Buyer Fundamental Representations.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall the
cumulative indemnification obligations of any Equityholder Indemnitor under
Section 11.02 exceed the portion of the Total Consideration Value actually
received by such Indemnitor, other than with respect to claims of, or arising
out of, Fraud or Willful Breach of such Equityholder Indemnitor.

(d)Absent Fraud or Willful Breach, the indemnification provisions contained in
this Article 11 provide the sole and exclusive monetary remedy following the
Closing as to all Damages any Indemnitee may incur in connection with this
Agreement (without limiting the procedures contemplated by Section 2.02 and it
being understood that nothing in this Section 11.03(d) or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall affect the parties' rights to specific performance or other
non-monetary equitable remedies with respect to the covenants referred to in
this Agreement or to be performed after the Closing). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, Buyer may recover from the Holdback Funds
any Damages which are suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to
which any of the Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of
whether or not such Damages relate to any Third Party Claim) and which arise
from or as a result of any Fraud or Willful Breach.

(e)The amount of Damages recoverable by any Indemnitee under this Article 11
and Section 8.06 with respect to any claim shall be (i) reduced by the amount
of any payment actually received by such Indemnitee from an insurance carrier
with respect to the Damages to which such claim relates (net of any deductible
or retention amount or any other third-party costs or expenses incurred by the
Indemnitee in obtaining such recovery, including any increased insurance
premiums); and (ii) reduced by the amount of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the applicable Indemnitee attributable to such Damages, but only
to the extent such net Tax benefit is actually realized by the Indemnitee 

in the taxable year in which such Damages were incurred or the immediately
succeeding taxable year, in each case determined on a "with and without" basis
(i.e., calculating the applicable Indemnitee's actual Tax liability as
compared to the applicable Indemnitee's hypothetical Tax liability as if the
Damages had not been incurred). Solely for the purposes of calculating the
amount of Damages recoverable by any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article 11
(and not for determining the existence of a breach of any representation or
warranty), the representations and warranties in this Agreement that are
qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be made
without such materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers; provided,
however, that this sentence shall not apply to the term "Material Contract" or
Section 3.05(a) or Section 3.06(a).

(f)Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve or abrogate any
Indemnitee of its duty to mitigate its Damages under common law, pursuant to
the laws of the state of New York.

Claims and Procedures; Holdbacks and Escrow 

(a)If (x) an Equityholder determines in good faith that the Equityholder has a
bona fide claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 11, such
Equityholder may deliver to the Buyer Indemnitor or (y) the Buyer determines
in good faith that the Buyer has a bona fide claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article 11, the Buyer may deliver to the Equityholder
Representative, in the case of each of clause (x) or (y), a certificate signed
by the Equityholder Representative or an authorized officer of the Buyer,
respectively (any certificate delivered in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 11.04(a) an "Claim Certificate"):

(i)stating that such Indemnitee has a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Article 11;

(ii)to the extent possible, containing a good faith non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled to
receive, which shall be the amount of Damages such Indemnitee claims to have
so incurred or suffered or could reasonably be expected to incur or suffer;
and

(iii)specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed) the material facts known to the Indemnitee giving rise to such
claim.

No delay in providing such Claim Certificate shall affect an Indemnitee's
rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitors
are prejudiced thereby.

(b)At any time of delivery of any Claim Certificate by the Buyer to the
Equityholder Representative, a duplicate copy of such Claim Certificate shall
be delivered to the Escrow Agent by or on behalf of the Buyer.

(c)If the Buyer Indemnitor or Equityholder Representative, as applicable, in
good faith objects to any claim made by the applicable Indemnitee in any Claim
Certificate, then the Buyer Indemnitor or Equityholder Representative,
respectively, shall deliver a written notice (a "Claim Dispute Notice") to the
Equityholder Representative or Buyer Indemnitor, respectively, during the
30-day period commencing upon receipt by the Buyer Indemnitor or Equityholder
Representative, respectively, of the Claim Certificate. The Claim Dispute
Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the principal basis for the
dispute of any claim made by the applicable Indemnitee in the Claim
Certificate. If the Equityholder Representative or Buyer Indemnitor, as
applicable, does not deliver a Claim Dispute Notice to the Buyer Indemnitor or
Equityholder Representative, respectively, prior to the expiration of such
30-day period, then each claim or indemnification set forth in such Claim
Certificate shall be deemed to have been conclusively determined in the
applicable Indemnitee's favor for purposes of this Article 11 on the terms set
forth in the Claim Certificate.

(d)In the event a party delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, then the parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections raised by the
applicable Indemnitor in such Claim Dispute Notice. If the parties agree to a
resolution of such objection, then a memorandum setting forth the matters
conclusively determined by the parties shall be prepared and signed by both
parties, and the parties shall promptly act in accordance with such
memorandum.

(e)If no such resolution can be reached during the 45-day period following the
receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon the expiration of such
45-day period, either party may bring a suit to resolve the objection in
accordance with Sections 12.08, 12.09 and 12.10. The decision of the trial
court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate
shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon each applicable
Indemnitee, 

each applicable Indemnitor and the Equityholder Representative, and the
parties shall promptly act in accordance with such decision. Judgment upon any
award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction.

(f)The Holdback Shares and Escrow Cash shall be held by Buyer and the Escrow
Agent, respectively, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and be available to compensate the Buyer for any claims by
such parties for any Damages suffered or incurred by them and for which they
are entitled to recovery under this Article 11. Each claim for Damages
pursuant to this Article 11 that is to be satisfied from (i) the Holdback
Shares shall be satisfied by forfeiture by the Indemnitors of the Holdback
Shares and (ii) the Escrow Cash shall be satisfied by release of such Escrow
Cash by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, in each case, in an amount as determined pursuant to Section
11.04(h) below. For purposes of this Article 11, Buyer Shares held as Holdback
Shares or received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be valued at
the Buyer Stock Price per Holdback Share.

(g)Except as set forth below, the period during which claims for Damages to be
recovered from the Holdback Funds may be made under this Agreement shall
commence at the Closing and terminate 15 days after the General Expiration
Date (the "Holdback Period"). Promptly, and in any event within 20 Business
Days, following (i) the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
(the "Initial Holdback Release Date"), the Holdback Initial Release Funds less
(x) the aggregate of all Due Amounts as of the Initial Holdback Release Date
and (y) without duplication of subclause (x), any amount of actual or good
faith estimated Damages in respect of any resolved claims that have yet to be
satisfied or any unresolved and pending claims specified in any Claim
Certificate ("Unresolved Claims") delivered to the Equityholder Representative
in accordance with Section 11.04(a) on or prior to the end of the Holdback
Period, shall be distributed to the Equityholders (through the Buyer, an
Acquired Company or a paying agent designated by the Buyer) in accordance with
Section 11.04(h) and (ii) the end of the Holdback Period, the undistributed
Holdback Funds, less the amount of actual or good faith estimated Damages in
respect of any Unresolved Claims delivered to the Equityholder Representative
in accordance with Section 11.04(a) on or prior to the end of the Holdback
Period, shall be distributed to the Equityholders (through the Buyer, an
Acquired Company or a paying agent designated by the Buyer) in accordance with
Section 11.04(h). In the event that there exist Unresolved Claims as of the
expiration of the Holdback Period, as soon as any such Unresolved Claim has
been resolved, Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within 20 Business Days
following the resolution or satisfaction of such Unresolved Claim, deliver (or
cause to be delivered) in accordance with Section 11.04(h), the portion of the
Holdback Funds, if any, that was retained for purposes of satisfying such
claim that was not needed to satisfy such claim or other Unresolved Claims.

(h) To the extent the Holdback Funds or any portion thereof are released to
the Equityholders pursuant to this Section 11.04, such funds shall be released
(i) in amounts equal to each such Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of such
released amounts and (ii) in the same ratio of cash to Buyer Shares as such
Equityholder received as part of such Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of the
Estimated Total Consideration Value (i.e., if such Equityholder received 55%
of its Pro Rata Share of the Estimated Total Consideration Value in cash and
45% in Buyer Shares, then such Equityholder would receive 55% of its Pro Rata
Share of the released Holdback Funds in cash, and 45% of its Pro Rata Share of
the released Holdback Funds in Buyer Shares). The amount of any Buyer Shares
so delivered to any Equityholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
number of Buyer Shares.

(i)The release of the Holdback Funds or any portion thereof to the
Equityholders pursuant to this Section 11.04 shall be made by (i) the Buyer
with respect to the Holdback Shares, in accordance with this Agreement, and
(ii) the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Cash, in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other

Defense of Third-Party Claims 

Except as otherwise provided in Article 8, in the event of the assertion of
any claim or the commencement by any Person of any Proceeding against (i) an
Indemnitee with respect to which any of the Equityholder Indemnitors may
become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse the
Buyer pursuant to this Article 11 (each, a "Third Party Claim"), the Buyer
shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such
Third Party Claim on its own; provided, however, that the Equityholder
Representative and its counsel (at the Indemnitors' sole expense) may
participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense of such Third
Party Claim. If Buyer so proceeds with the defense of any such Third Party
Claim:

(a)the Equityholder Representative shall, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Indemnitor to, make available to Buyer any
documents and materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to
the defense of such Third Party Claim;

(b)the Buyer shall keep the Equityholder Representative reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Third Party Claim; and

(c)the Buyer shall have the right to control, settle, adjust or compromise
such Proceeding without the consent of the Equityholder Representative;
provided, however, that except with the consent of the Equityholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), no settlement of any such Proceeding shall be determinative of
either the fact that liability may be recovered by the Buyer in respect of
such Third Party Claim pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this
Article 11 or the amount of such liability that may be recovered by the Buyer
in respect of such Third Party Claim pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of this Article 11. If the Equityholder Representative consents to
such settlement, neither the Equityholder Representative nor any Equityholder
Indemnitor will have any power or authority to object to the amount or
validity of any claim by or on behalf of the Buyer for indemnity with respect
such settlement.

Buyer shall give the Equityholder Representative prompt notice of the
commencement of any such Third Party Claim against Buyer; provided, however,
that any failure on the part of Buyer to so notify the Equityholder
Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors under
this Article 11 (except to the extent such failure prejudices the defense of
such Proceeding).

Equityholder Representative 

(a)By virtue of the executing and delivering this Agreement or an effective
joinder hereto, each of the Equityholders shall have irrevocably constituted
and appointed, upon the Closing (and by execution of this Agreement as
Equityholder Representative, Qualgro Partners Pte. Ltd. hereby accepts
appointment) as the exclusive and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (the
"Equityholder Representative") of the Equityholders for all purposes under
this Agreement, including for the purposes of (a) making, litigating,
arbitrating, resolving, settling, waiving or compromising any claim under or
in connection with this Agreement, (b) giving and receiving notices and
communications under this Agreement or in respect of any claims, (c) executing
and delivering all documents necessary or desirable to carry out the
foregoing, and (d) taking all other actions, or refraining from taking any
action, necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of the
Equityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

(b)The Equityholder Representative shall have and may exercise all of the
powers conferred upon it pursuant to this Agreement, including:

(i)to act for the Equityholders with regard to all matters pertaining to
indemnification referred to in this Agreement, including the power to
compromise and settle any indemnity claim on behalf of the Equityholders and
to transact matters of litigation or other Proceedings;

(ii)to execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
stock powers, certificates and documents that the Equityholder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

(iii)to execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement that
the Equityholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate, whether prior
to, at or after the Closing;

(iv)the power to consult with, engage and rely on any accountants or advisors
retained and other experts, including legal counsel, selected by it, (subject
to Section 12.01(e)) solely at the cost and expense of the Sellers;

(v)the power to review, negotiate and agree the calculation and determination
of any post-Closing adjustments under Section 2.02(b);

(vi)to receive funds for the payment of expenses of the Equityholders and
apply such funds in payment for such expenses;

(vii)the power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement providing
rights or benefits to the Sellers in accordance with the terms hereof and in
the manner provided herein;

(viii)to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the

(ix)to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

(c)The Equityholder Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement
or otherwise a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Equityholder.

(d)Upon receipt or notice of any Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.06,
the Equityholder Representative shall give prompt notice of the amount and
details thereof (to the extent of the information in its possession) to the
relevant Equityholder or Equityholders.

(e)Buyer, the Company and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely
rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the Equityholder Representative in
all matters referred to herein. The Equityholder Representative shall act for
the Equityholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the
manner the Equityholder Representative believes to be in the best interest of
all of the Equityholders, taken as a whole, and consistent with the
obligations under this Agreement, but the Equityholder Representative shall
not be responsible to the Equityholders for any Damages the Equityholders may
suffer by the performance of its duties under this Agreement, other than
Damages arising from willful violation of the law or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties under this Agreement. If the Equityholder
Representative shall be unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, its
successor who shall serve and exercise the powers of the Equityholder
Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be
appointed by a written instrument signed by Equityholders holding at least a
majority of the outstanding Shares (on an as converted to ordinary share
basis) as of immediately prior to the Closing. In the event of removal or
replacement of the Equityholder Representative, the Sellers must be provided
prompt written notice of such replacement, including the contact and notice
information for such newly appointed Equityholder Representative.

(f)The Equityholder Representative shall not be personally liable as the
Equityholder Representative to any Equityholder for any act done or omitted
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as Equityholder Representative
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The
Equityholders shall severally (but not jointly or jointly and severally)
indemnify the Equityholder Representative and hold the Equityholder
Representative harmless against any Damages incurred and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Equityholder
Representative's duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(g)The Equityholder Representative shall serve as the Equityholder
Representative without compensation, provided that the Equityholder
Representative shall use the Equityholder Representative Expense Account to
pay any expenses incurred by the Equityholder Representative in fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each of the
Equityholders agree that, in the event that the Equityholder Representative
Expense Account is depleted prior to the obligations of the Equityholder
Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement being completed,
such Equityholder agrees to reimburse the Equityholder Representative for such
Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of all reasonable documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Equityholder Representative in the performance of its
duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Equityholder
Representative shall distribute any remaining balance of the Equityholder
Representative Expense 

Account to the Equityholders upon completion by the Equityholder
Representative of its duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Any such distributions from the Equityholder Representative Expense Account
shall be paid to the Equityholders, with equal priority and pro rata based on
each such Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of the Equityholder Representative
Expense Account, up to the aggregate total amount the Buyer originally
deposited in the Equityholder Representative Expense Account.
