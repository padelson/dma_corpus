Section 2.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, if such
section provides for appraisal rights for such Shares in the Merger ("
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration unless and until such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without interest. The
Company shall give the Acquiror (a) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
of Shares pursuant to the DGCL, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any
other related instruments, in each case, received by the Company, and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
the Acquiror, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, such demands.

 



 

Section 2.9 _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Option (whether
vested or unvested) shall be cancelled, and the holder of each such Option
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product of (a) the number of Shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Option was formerly vested (including any accelerated vesting as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and exercisable and (b) the
excess of the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration over the per Share
exercise price of such Option, if any. The holder of any Option shall also be
entitled to any amounts that may be payable in respect of such Option as
provided in Section 2.17 of this Agreement, at the respective times and
subject to the contingencies specified herein. All amounts due under this
Section 2.9 in respect of Options shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation
in accordance with, and promptly following receipt of (but in no event prior
to the Effective Time), the Closing Date Payment Allocation Schedule or any
Distribution Date Payment Allocation Schedule, as applicable. The amounts
described in this Section 2.9 shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Options.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Warrant shall
be cancelled, and the holder of each such Warrant shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the number
of Shares of Company Common Stock for which such Warrant was formerly
exercisable and (b) the excess of the Closing Date Per Share Merger
Consideration over the per Share exercise price of such Warrant, if any. The
holder of any Warrant shall also be entitled to any amounts that may be
payable in respect of such Warrant as provided in Section 2.17 of this
Agreement, at the respective times and subject

 



      
 

 



 

to the contingencies specified herein. The amounts described in this Section
2.10 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Warrants.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Payment for Shares and Warrants_.

 



 

(a) The Acquiror designates the Escrow and Paying Agent to act as paying agent
in connection with the Merger pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement. At or
prior to the Closing, the Acquiror shall deposit with the Escrow and Paying
Agent, for the benefit of holders of Shares (each, a " _Company Stockholder_
") and holders of the Warrants, cash in an amount equal to (i) the Closing
Merger Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the Option Closing Payment Amount (the "
_Payment Fund_ "). For purposes of determining the Merger Consideration to be
made available, the Acquiror shall assume that no Company Stockholder will
perfect a right to appraisal of its Shares. The expenses of the Escrow and
Paying Agent shall be paid by the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be.

 



 

(b) The Escrow and Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment
Fund as directed by the Acquiror or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation, in: (i) direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of
and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of
America with a remaining term at the time of acquisition thereof not in excess
of ninety (90) days, (ii) money market accounts or certificates of deposit
maturing within ninety (90) days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a
bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America
or a state thereof and having a combined capital surplus in excess of five-
hundred million dollars ($500 million), or (iii) commercial paper issued by a
domestic corporation and given a rating of no lower than A-1 by Standard and
Poors Corporation or P-1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid as directed by the
Acquiror or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment
Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
payments of the Closing Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the
Acquiror shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund
lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund
is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and
in any event within five (5) Business Days, the Company shall deliver to the
Acquiror and the Escrow and Paying Agent a list with the names and addresses
of the Persons who are holders of record of a certificate or certificates
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced outstanding Shares or
Warrants (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares or Warrants will be
converted into the right to receive the consideration described in Sections
2.7, Section 2.10 and Section 2.17, and as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter the Acquiror shall cause the Escrow and Paying Agent to mail to
each such Person, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Escrow and
Paying Agent) in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment therefor. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Escrow and Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, (i) if

 



      
 

 



 

such surrender is made at least two (2) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, on the Closing Date, or (ii) if such surrender is on or after the
Closing Date, promptly following the Closing Date and in no event more than
three (3) Business Days after such surrender, the consideration set forth in
the Closing Date Payment Allocation Schedule to which the former holder
thereof is entitled as of the Closing with respect to the Shares or Warrants
formerly represented by such Certificate, without interest, and such
Certificate shall, upon such surrender, be cancelled. If payment in respect of
any Certificate is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
such Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Acquiror and the Escrow and Paying
Agent that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate have been paid
or are not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 2.11, any Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, in cash, without interest,
as contemplated herein.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any Shares
or Warrants thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective
Time, a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Cancelled Shares) is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.11.

 



 

(e) All cash paid or required to be paid upon conversion of the Shares and
Warrants in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall, when paid in
full, be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares and Warrants. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Shares or Warrants represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Company, if
prior to the Closing Date, shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a replacement Certificate, and the
Surviving Corporation, if after the Closing Date, shall pay or cause to be
paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the relevant
portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.11(c) for the Shares or Warrants represented thereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow and
Paying Agent may, in their discretion, require the delivery of a reasonable
indemnity.

 



 

(g) At any time following the expiration of twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Escrow and Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Escrow and
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
such funds shall thereafter become the property of the Surviving Corporation.
Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation

 



      
 

 



 

(subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable consideration payable
as contemplated by this Agreement (net of any amounts that would be subject to
withholding) upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Any portion of such remaining cash unclaimed by Equityholders as of a
date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, the Acquiror will make (or
cause to be made) the following payments, in each case by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the payee
in writing no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) to the Escrow and Paying Agent, (i) an amount equal to the Payment Fund as
specified in Section 2.11(a), (ii) for deposit into the Escrow Account, the
Escrow Amount and (iii) for deposit into the Net Adjustment Holdback Account,
the Net Adjustment Holdback Amount;

 



 

(b) to the Stockholder Representative, for deposit into the Stockholder
Representative Expense Holdback Account, the Stockholder Representative
Expense Holdback Amount;

 



 

(c) to the Company, an amount equal to the Option Closing Payment Amount,
which amount shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the holders of
outstanding Options as set forth in Section 2.9 utilizing the Surviving
Corporations payroll system;

 



 

(d) on behalf of the Company, the amount payable to each counterparty or
holder of Funded Indebtedness in order to fully discharge such Funded
Indebtedness and terminate all applicable obligations, liabilities and
Encumbrances of the Company and any of its Affiliates related thereto; and

 



 

(e) on behalf of the Company, an amount equal to the Estimated Other Seller
Expenses, plus the Estimated Transaction Expenses, plus the Estimated PBG
Payment Amount, which amount shall be paid to each Person who is owed a
portion thereof as and when such amounts are due.

 



 

Section 2.13 _Merger Consideration Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to the Acquiror a statement (the " _Preliminary
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a good-faith estimate of each of the
Companys (i) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "),
(ii) Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Cash (the "
_Estimated Cash_ "), (iv) Other Seller Expenses (the " _Estimated Other Seller
Expenses_ "), (v) Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_
"), (vi) PBG Payment Amount (the " _Estimated PBG Payment Amount_ "), and
(vii) Tax Amount (the " _Estimated Tax Amount_ ") each determined as of the
Closing Date (and, except for Estimated Other Seller Expenses, Estimated
Transaction Expenses, the Estimated PBG Payment Amount, and the Estimated Tax

 



       
 

 



 

Amount, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), based
on the Companys books and records and other information available to the
Company at the Closing and, on the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of
the Closing Merger Consideration. An illustrative example of a Preliminary
Closing Statement and calculation of Net Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash,
Other Seller Expenses, Transaction Expenses, the PBG Payment Amount and the
Estimated Tax Amount is set forth as _Schedule 2.13(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules (the " _Sample Statement_ "). Estimated Net Working Capital,
Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Cash, Estimated Other Seller Expenses,
Estimated Transaction Expenses, the Estimated PBG Payment Amount and the
Estimated Tax Amount shall be calculated on a basis consistent with the Sample
Statement, the Net Working Capital Methodology and the Applicable Accounting
Principles. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the current
liabilities figure used in the calculation of Net Working Capital include any
liabilities of any kind that are included in the figures in Section
2.13(a)(ii)-(vii) above.

 



 

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written statement
(the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") that shall include and set forth a
calculation in reasonable detail of the actual (i) Net Working Capital ("
_Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) Indebtedness (" _Closing Indebtedness_
"), (iii) Cash (" _Closing Cash_ "), (iv) Other Seller Expenses (" _Closing
Other Seller Expenses_ "), (v) Transaction Expenses (" _Closing Transaction
Expenses_ "), (vi) the PBG Payment Amount (" _Closing PBG Payment Amount_ "),
and (vii) the Tax Amount (" _Closing Tax Amount_ "), each determined as of the
Closing Date (and, except for Closing Other Seller Expenses, Closing
Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount and the Closing Tax
Amount, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein). The
Final Closing Statement shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
Applicable Accounting Principles, the Net Working Capital Methodology and the
Sample Statement.

 



 

(c) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the
thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of
such period, the Stockholder Representative delivers to the Acquiror written
notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying the
nature and amount of any dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other Seller Expenses, Closing
Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount and/or the Closing Tax
Amount, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement. The Stockholder
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other
Seller Expenses, Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount
and/or the Closing Tax Amount not specifically referenced in the Notice of
Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review in
accordance with Section 2.13(d). Any Notice of Disagreement may only set forth
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on the amounts of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other
Seller Expenses, Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount
and/or the Closing Tax Amount as reflected on the Final Closing Statement not
being calculated in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles, the
Net Working Capital Methodology and the Sample Statement.

 



 

(d) During the fifteen (15)-day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Stockholder Representative to the Acquiror, the parties in
good faith shall

 



      
 

 



 

seek to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash, Closing Other Seller Expenses, Closing Transaction Expenses, the
Closing PBG Payment Amount and/or the Closing Tax Amount as specified therein.
Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Stockholder Representative
and the Acquiror within such 15-day period shall be final and binding with
respect to such items, and if the Stockholder Representative and the Acquiror
agree in writing on the resolution of each disputed item specified by the
Acquiror in the Notice of Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other Seller
Expenses, Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount and the
Closing Tax Amount, the amounts so determined shall be final and binding on
the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Stockholder Representative and
the Acquiror have not resolved all such differences by the end of such fifteen
(15)-day period, the Stockholder Representative and the Acquiror shall have an
additional fifteen (15) days thereafter to submit, in writing, to an
independent public accounting firm (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
their briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each
item remaining in dispute and the amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other Seller Expenses, Closing
Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount and the Closing Tax
Amount, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination
as to each such disputed item and the amount of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other Seller Expenses,
Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount and the Closing
Tax Amount. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be BDO USA, LLP or, if such
firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public accounting
firm as shall be agreed in writing by the Stockholder Representative and the
Acquiror. The Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to
render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within thirty
(30) days following the submission thereof. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items and amounts in the Acquirors and the
Stockholder Representatives respective calculations of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other Seller
Expenses, Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount and the
Closing Tax Amount that are identified as being items and amounts to which the
Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative have been unable to agree. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be limited to correcting mathematical errors and determining whether the items
and amounts in dispute were determined in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles, the Net Working Capital Methodology and the Sample
Statement and the Independent Accounting Firm is not to make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether the Target Net
Working Capital or any estimates on the Preliminary Closing Statement are
correct, adequate or sufficient. In resolving any disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Independent
Accounting Firms determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash, Closing Other Seller Expenses, Closing Transaction
Expenses, the Closing PBG Payment Amount and/or the Closing Tax Amount shall
be based solely on written materials submitted by the Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative (i.e., not on any extraneous information or data).
The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto and shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be subject to appeal or further review. Judgment may be entered upon the
written determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with
Section 10.9. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm
will be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

 



 

(e) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Equityholders, and
paid out of the Escrow Account) and the Acquiror in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on
the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined
by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm
is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. Except as provided in the
first sentence of this Section 2.13(e), the fees and disbursements of each
party, including those of such partys Representatives, incurred in connection
with the preparation or review of the Final Closing Statement, the preparation
or review of any Notice of Disagreement, and/or any written briefs submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm, as applicable, shall be borne by such
party. The costs and expenses of any enforcement of the determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm (including reasonable attorneys fees) shall be
payable by the Acquiror or the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of
the Equityholders, and paid out of the Escrow Account), as applicable, whose
failure to comply with the conclusive and binding order of the Independent
Accounting Firm causes the other party to pursue and enforcement action.

 



 

(f) The Acquiror and the Company will, and the Acquiror will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, during the period from and after the Closing Date
through the resolution of any adjustment to the Merger Consideration
contemplated by this Section 2.13, afford the Stockholder Representative and
its Representatives access, to the personnel, properties, books and records of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and their
Subsidiaries and to any other information reasonably necessary for purposes of
reviewing the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.13. Each of the
Acquiror, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative, as applicable, shall authorize its accountants to disclose
work papers generated by such accountants in connection with preparing and
reviewing the calculations specified in this Section 2.13; _provided_ that
such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers available
except in accordance with such accountants disclosure procedures and then
only after the non-client party has signed an agreement relating to access to
such work papers in form and substance acceptable to such accountants.

 



 

(g) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as
follows:

 



 

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means
an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to

 



 

(A) the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.13, _minus_ the Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_

 



      
 

 



 

(B) the Estimated Indebtedness, _minus_ the Closing Indebtedness as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.13, _plus_

 



 

(C) the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.13,
_minus_ the Estimated Cash, _plus_

 



 

(D) the Estimated Other Seller Expenses, _minus_ the Closing Other Seller
Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.13, _plus_

 



 

(E) the Estimated Transaction Expenses, _minus_ the Closing Transaction
Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.13, _plus_

 



 

(F) the Estimated PBG Payment Amount, _minus_ the Closing PBG Payment Amount
as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.13, _plus_

 



 

(G) the Estimated Tax Amount, _minus_ the Closing Tax Amount.

 



 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In such
event, the Acquiror shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to (A) the Escrow and
Paying Agent for prompt distribution and delivery to the holders of the Shares
and Warrants and (B) the Surviving Corporation for prompt distribution and
delivery to holders of Options through the Surviving Corporations payroll
system, which payments shall be allocated in accordance with Section 2.17
hereof.

 



 

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In such
event, the Escrow and Paying Agent (on behalf of the Equityholders) shall
promptly deliver to the Acquiror the Net Adjustment Amount from the Net
Adjustment Holdback Account and, if the Net Adjustment Amount is greater than
the available funds in the Net Adjustment Holdback Account, the Escrow
Account.

 



 

(iv) In the event any funds remain in the Net Adjustment Holdback Account
after completion of the payment of the adjustments described in Section
2.13(g)(ii) or (iii), the Escrow and Paying Agent shall promptly distribute
all remaining amounts in the Net Adjustment Holdback Account to (A) the
holders of the Shares and Warrants and (B) the Surviving Corporation for
prompt distribution and delivery to holders of Options through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the
entire amount of the Net Adjustment Holdback Account in the event a payment
was made under Section 2.13(g)(ii)), which payments shall be allocated in
accordance with Section 2.17 hereof.

 



 

(h) Amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.13(g) shall bear interest from
the Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by _The Wall Street Journal_ as
the prime rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number
of days elapsed. Payments in respect of Section 2.13(g) shall

 



      
 

 



 

be made within three (3) Business Days of final determination of the Net
Adjustment Amount pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.13.

 



 

Section 2.14 _Withholding_. Each of the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation
and the Escrow and Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as (i) if prior to the Closing, the Acquiror, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, and (ii) if after the Closing, the
Acquiror, reasonably determine that it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, Treasury Regulations or
any provision of applicable Tax Law, subject to approval by the Stockholder
Representative. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld or paid over
to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by the Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation or the Escrow and Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.15 _Offset_. Each of the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the
Escrow and Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts that are owed by such Person to the Company as of the Closing Date
(the "Offset Amount"), as set forth on _Schedule 2.15_ of the Disclosure
Schedules or the Closing Date Payment Allocation Schedule. Any consideration
otherwise payable to a Person that is withheld by the Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section
2.15 in the satisfaction of an amount owed by such Person shall reduce the
amount owed by such Person to the Company, to the extent of the amount of such
withholding by the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.16 _Stockholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) Immediately upon the approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote or
written consent of the Company Stockholders, each Equityholder (other than a
holder of Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed to have consented to the
appointment of Shareholder Representative Services LLC as such Equityholders
representative and attorney-in-fact (the " _Stockholder Representative_ "),
with full power of substitution to act on behalf of the Equityholders (other
than a holder of Dissenting Shares) from and after the Closing to the extent
and in the manner set forth in this Agreement. The Stockholder Representative
shall be authorized, on behalf of the Equityholders (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares), from and after the Closing, (i) to prepare the
Distribution Date Payment Allocation Schedules required to be prepared from
time to time hereunder and to resolve any disputes related to the payment of
any Closing Merger Consideration or any Distribution Date Payment Amounts,
including any Delayed Equityholder Payment Amount, (ii) to discuss, negotiate,
resolve and fully and finally settle on behalf of the Equityholders (other
than holders of Dissenting Shares) any claims for indemnification by any
Indemnitee under Article IX, (iii) to discuss, negotiate, resolve and fully
and finally settle on behalf of the Equityholders (other than Dissenting
Shares) any matter or dispute with respect to the Final Closing Statement and
the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.13, and/or the Delayed Payment
Amount, (iv) to take any action, including litigating, defending or enforcing
any actions, and to make, deliver and sign any certificate, notice, consent or
instrument required or permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement
or under the documents referred to in this Agreement which the Stockholder
Representative determines in its

 



      
 

 



 

discretion to be necessary, appropriate or desirable ( _provided_ , _however_
if any individual Equityholder is named in such litigation, such Equityholder
shall have the right to tender defense), (v) to hire or retain, such counsel,
investment bankers, accountants, representatives and other professional and
technical advisors (including former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) as it determines in its sole and absolute discretion to be
necessary, advisable or appropriate in order to carry out and perform its
rights and obligations hereunder, (vi) to discuss, negotiate, resolve and
fully and finally settle on behalf of the Equityholders and take any other
action with respect to the certain Tax matters discussed in Article VI and
(vii) to receive all documents, certificates and notices and make all
determinations on behalf of the Equityholders required under this Agreement.
All decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Stockholder
Representative shall be binding upon all of the Equityholders (other than a
holder of Dissenting Shares), and no Equityholders (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares) shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The Acquiror shall not have the right to object
to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the authority of the
Stockholder Representative. The Acquiror and Sub shall be entitled to rely on
any decision, action, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative
as being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the Equityholders
(other than a holder of Dissenting Shares), and the Acquiror and Sub are
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction. Each of the
Acquiror, Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby waive, and by their
approval of this Agreement, the Equityholders (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed to have waived, any claims they may have or
assert, including those that may arise in the future, against the Stockholder
Representative for any action or inaction taken or not taken by the
Stockholder Representative in connection with such persons capacity as
Stockholder Representative (including, any action or inaction taken or not
taken in connection with the Stockholder Representatives preparation and
delivery of any Distribution Date Payment Allocation Schedule pursuant to
Section 2.17 hereof) except to the extent that such action or inaction shall
have been held by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Subject to Section 2.16(b), the
Equityholders, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis relative to
their ownership of the Fully Diluted Shares of the Company immediately prior
to the Closing Date compared to the ownership of Fully Diluted Shares of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date of all Equityholders, will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of
document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative
Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
_provided_ , that to the extent that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been caused primarily by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative
will reimburse the Equityholders such portion of the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to recover any such
Representative Losses from (i) the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback
Account, (ii) solely to the extent funds are available after final
determination of the Net Adjustment Amount and the payment, if any, to the
Acquiror pursuant to Section 2.13(g)(iii), the Net

 



      
 

 



 

Adjustment Holdback Account prior to any distribution of such amounts to the
Equityholders and (iii) the Escrow Account, either as provided by this
Agreement or to the extent funds are to be distributed to the Equityholders,
prior to any distribution of such amounts to the Equityholders prior to
proceeding directly against any Equityholder; _provided_ , that this does not
relieve the Equityholders from their several and not joint obligation (on a
pro rata basis relative to their ownership of the Fully Diluted Shares of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date) to pay such Representative
Losses if the funds in the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback
Account, the Net Adjustment Holdback Amount and the Escrow Account are not
available. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Equityholders or otherwise. The
Equityholders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will
survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement. At such time, or from time to time, that the
Stockholder Representative determines that the Stockholder Representative
Expense Holdback Amount or any portion thereof will no longer be required for
the payment of such Representative Losses, the Stockholder Representative
shall distribute such remaining amount or portion of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Holdback Amount to (A) the Escrow and Paying Agent for
prompt distribution and delivery to the holders of the Shares and Warrants and
(B) the Surviving Corporation for prompt distribution and delivery to holders
of Options through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, which payments
shall be allocated in accordance with Section 2.17 hereof.

 



 

(c) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Company
Stockholders holding a majority of the aggregate number of Fully Diluted
Shares held by all Company Stockholders at the Effective Time (the " _Majority
Holders_ "). In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of
the Stockholder Representative, a new Stockholder Representative shall be
appointed by the vote or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of
such vote or a copy of the written consent appointing such new Stockholder
Representative shall be sent to the Acquiror and, after the Effective Time, to
the Surviving Corporation, such appointment to be effective upon the later of
the date indicated in such consent or the date such consent is received by the
Acquiror and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) The approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote or written consent of
Company Stockholders shall also be deemed to constitute approval of all
arrangements relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the
provisions hereof binding upon the Equityholders.

 



 

Section 2.17 _Post-Closing Distributions_.

 



 

(a) _Allocation of Post-Closing Distributions_. Subject to Section 2.16(b), in
the event of any distribution of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section
2.13(g)(ii), any distribution of all or the remaining portion of the Net

Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 9.6(b), in each case to the extent such
distribution is to the Equityholders, the aggregate amount to be distributed

an authorized officer of the Company and, if designated by the Company, its
Representatives, to contact customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers and
business partners at the Company and Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or concerning their relationship
with the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at the Acquirors
expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of the Companys
personnel and in such a manner as not unreasonably to interfere with the
normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose any information to the Acquiror or
its Representatives if such disclosure would, in the Companys sole
discretion, (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or
(ii) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(b) For a period of seven years after the Closing or, if shorter, the
applicable period specified in the Companys document retention policy, but in
no event shorter than the Claims Expiration Date, the Company shall (i) retain
the books and records relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to
periods prior to the Closing and (ii) afford the Representatives of the
Company Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative reasonable access
(including the right to make, at the applicable Company Stockholders or the
Stockholder Representatives expense, photocopies), upon reasonable notice,
and for a reasonable business purpose, during normal business hours, to
inspect the books and records.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Delayed Payment Obligation_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the achievement by the Surviving Company or resulting business group of
certain targets, as set forth in _Exhibit E_ attached hereto, is a factor in
determining the valuation of the Company. The Acquiror shall treat any
resulting Delayed Payment Amount in accordance with this Section 5.3 and
_Exhibit E_ attached hereto. All capitalized terms used in _Exhibit E_
attached hereto and not defined in the body of this Agreement have the meaning
given them in _Exhibit E_ attached hereto.

 



 

(b) Any Delayed Payment Amount payable pursuant to this Section 5.3 and
_Exhibit E_ attached hereto constitutes part of the Merger Consideration and
shall be treated as such for all Tax purposes.

 



 

(c) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.3 and _Exhibit E_ attached
hereto, the Acquiror shall release and pay (i) the Delayed Equityholder
Payment Amount to the Escrow and Paying Agent for subsequent distribution to
the Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.17, (i) the Delayed CS Payment
Amount to Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and (iii) the Delayed PBG Payment
Amount to Bottling Group, LLC.

 



 

(d) The rights of the Equityholders to any Delayed Equityholder Payment Amount
are not intended to constitute securities, will not be represented by a
certificate and are personal to each Equityholder. No Equityholder may sell,
exchange, transfer or otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion of the Delayed
Equityholder Payment Amount, other than by the laws of descent and
distribution or succession, and any transfer in violation of this Section
5.3(e) shall be null and void and shall not be recognized by the Acquiror or
the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Written Consent_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and the Companys
applicable Organizational Documents and the Company Stockholders Agreement to
solicit, and cause to be delivered to Acquiror, (i) an irrevocable written
consent that adopts and approves of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, signed by Company Stockholders having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted and (ii) a termination agreement that terminates the Stockholders
Agreement, effective as of the Closing, signed by the requisite number of
Company Stockholders to terminate the Stockholders Agreement. The Acquiror
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if such irrevocable written
consent and termination agreement are not delivered to the Acquiror at or
before 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the calendar day immediately after the date
hereof; _provided_ , that if such irrevocable written consent and termination
agreement are not delivered to the Acquiror by such time, but is subsequently
delivered prior to Acquiror exercising its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 5.4, the right of termination by the Acquiror
pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall expire at the time such written consent and
termination agreement are delivered to the Acquiror.

 



 

(b) The Company will deliver to all Company Stockholders who have not
consented to the Merger at or prior to the Closing notice of the taking of
such action by Company Stockholders, as required by Section 228(e) of the
DGCL. The Company will comply with the notification requirements under the
DGCL regarding appraisal and dissenters rights for all Company Stockholders.

 



 

(c) In addition, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall, in accordance with the DGCL and the Companys applicable
Organizational Documents and the Company Stockholders Agreement, submit for
approval by the Company Stockholders by the requisite vote, any payments or
benefits set forth on _Schedule 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules
and reasonably expected to constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section
280G of the Code, such that, if approved, any such payments and benefits shall
not be deemed to be "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
or shall be exempt from such treatment under such Section 280G. The Company
shall cause to be delivered to the Acquiror prior to the Closing, confirmation
that the requisite vote has been taken and approved, signed by Company
Stockholders having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be
necessary to constitute the requisite vote.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the Closing, the Company
shall promptly notify the Acquiror in writing of any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware
that will or is reasonably likely to

 



      
 

 



 

result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement
becoming incapable of being satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.6 _No Hire; No Solicitation_. If this Agreement is terminated prior
to Effective Time, the Acquiror will not, for a period of three years
thereafter, without the prior written consent of the Company, either alone or
in combination with any other Person, directly or indirectly, or through its
present or future Affiliates, (a) hire or solicit (other than a hiring or
solicitation by general advertisement) any person who is an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at the date hereof or at any time
hereafter that precedes such termination, to terminate his or her employment
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (b) hire any of the
individuals listed on _Schedule 5.6_ of the Disclosure Schedules. The Acquiror
agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by the Acquiror of this Section
5.6 would be inadequate, and that the Company would be entitled to injunctive
relief in such a case. If it is ever held that this restriction on the
Acquiror is too onerous and is not necessary for the protection of the
Company, the Acquiror agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may
impose such lesser restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary
or appropriate to properly protect the Company.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statutes_. If any applicable state takeover statute or
similar Law shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company and the Acquiror and their respective Board of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or thereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) The Acquiror shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the employees
other than the employees entering into a Consulting/Employment Agreement (the
" _Affected Employees_ ") or former employees (presently entitled to benefits)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, for a period of one year following the
Effective Time, compensation and employee benefits that in the aggregate are
reasonably comparable or superior to those currently provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to their employees, and the Acquiror shall cause to be
provided to any Affected Employee who is terminated during such one-year
period following the Effective Time severance benefits comparable or superior
to those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to similarly
situated employees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Acquiror shall not be required to establish or maintain a stock
option or other equity award plan or any retiree medical plan. From and after
the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor, in accordance with the terms thereof,
all existing employment, severance, change of control and salary continuation
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or
former officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or group of such officers, directors, employees or consultants,
in each case, to the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would have
been required to perform such agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
unused vacation, holiday, sickness and personal days accrued by the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the policies and practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In the event of any change in the welfare
benefits provided to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any plan, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Affected Employees and their covered dependents under such
plan (except to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods
would apply under the Companys or such Subsidiarys then-existing plans
absent any change in such welfare coverage plan) and (ii) provide each
Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in coverage in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such
new or changed plan. The Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, for all purposes other than for benefit accruals under
Acquirors or its Affiliates defined benefit pension retirement plans and
eligibility for retiree medical, provide each Affected Employee with credit
for all service with the Company and its Affiliates under each employee
benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement in which such Affected Employee
is eligible to participate, except to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of services.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.8 shall be construed to create any
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any dependent
thereof) of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment for any specified period, nor
to require the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific
employee benefit plans.

 



 

(d) The Company will take all actions necessary to terminate all Employee
Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, including but
not limited to The Cyto Group 401(k) Plan, effective immediately before the
Effective Time, including adopting the relevant resolutions and any actions
required under the terms of such Employee Plans and any other contractual
obligations of the Company and applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties shall hold, and shall cause
its Representatives to hold in confidence all documents and information
furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party to this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of
the confidentiality agreement dated October 29, 2013 between the Acquiror and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in
full force and effect until the Closing Date, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the parties under this
Section 5.9 shall terminate. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and
make effective the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including to (i)
obtain from Governmental Authorities and other Persons all consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) promptly
(and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof) make
all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions,
with respect to this Agreement required under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Law; (iii) to the extent proper and advisable, participate and
defend against or otherwise pursue any litigation that may be commenced by a
Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iv) in the event that the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the United States Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ ") issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material
(a " _Second Request_ ") under the HSR Act in relation to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take such measures as may
be reasonably necessary to limit the scope of such Second Request, certify
substantial compliance with such Second Request and otherwise respond to and
seek to resolve any requests for information, documents, data or testimony
made by the FTC or the DOJ under the HSR Act; and (v) prevent the entry of,
and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order relating to the HSR Act or other applicable Law that
would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the
parties hereto understand and agree that in no event shall the Acquiror or the
Company be required by this Section 5.10 or any other provision of this
Agreement to: (A) enter into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby; or (B) divest or otherwise hold separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or take any other action (or
otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing) in the case of either of the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B) with respect to any of the material businesses,
assets or properties of the Acquiror or the Company or any of their respective
material Subsidiaries. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each of the parties shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act or any other applicable Law and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other applicable Law as soon as practicable. The Company and the Acquiror
shall each pay one-half of the filing fees for the filing under the HSR Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties shall promptly notify the other parties of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and,
to the extent proper and advisable, permit the other parties to review in
advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority. No party to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry without giving notice to the other parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, giving
the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.

 



 

(c) Certain consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be required from third parties to contracts to which the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is a party that have not been and may
not be obtained prior to the consummation of the Merger. Neither the Company
nor any Equityholder shall have

 



      
 

 



 

any liability, including under Article IX, to the Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
consents or waivers that may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the termination of any contract
as a result thereof, and no such failure or termination shall result in the
failure of any condition set forth in Article VII.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except as may be required by applicable
Law, the parties hereto shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to obtaining the other parties written approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, following the Closing Date and the public
announcement of the Merger, the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted
to publically announce that it has been engaged to serve as the Stockholder
Representative, naming no parties other than the Acquiror and the Company and
disclosing no other terms of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) The Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now,
or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") against any and all Damages arising out of
or relating to any threatened or actual Action or claim based in whole or in
part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or
prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Closing Date (the " _D andO Indemnified Liabilities_"), including all
DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the full extent permitted under
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any DandO
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Closing Date), (i) the
DandO Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably
satisfactory to the Acquiror, and the Acquiror shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, pay all fees and expenses of
such counsel for the DandO Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are
received and (ii) the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries
and each DandO Indemnified Party will use all reasonable efforts to assist in
the vigorous defense of any such matter. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 5.12 shall promptly notify the
Acquiror upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any
liability which it may have under this Section 5.12). The parties hereto agree
that all rights to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to
advances of expenses incurred in defense of any such action or suit, existing
in favor of the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring
through the Closing Date shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of not less than six years from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any DandO

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such DandO Indemnified Liabilities; _provided, further_
, that any DandO Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced or paid to
pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall provide an undertaking to repay such
advances or payments if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have lapsed that such DandO Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law or the
Organizational Documents and pursuant to this Section 5.12(a). The rights to
indemnification hereunder do not replace, and shall be in addition to, any
existing rights to indemnification with respect to each DandO Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a six-year prepaid
"tail policy" covering the persons who are presently covered by the officers
and directors liability insurance policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date on terms and conditions (in both amount
and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Closing Date, covering, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated hereby. The expense of such "tail policy" shall
be a Transaction Expense, and shall not affect the calculation of Net Working
Capital (i.e., any liability for such expense shall be excluded in the
calculation of Net Working Capital). The Acquiror shall cause such policy to
be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) The Acquiror covenants, for itself and its successors and assigns, that it
and they shall not institute any Action or make any claim in any court or
before any administrative agency or before any other tribunal against any of
the current directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in their capacity
as such, with respect to any liabilities, actions or causes of action,
judgments, claims or demands of any nature or description (consequential,
compensatory, punitive or otherwise), in each such case to the extent
resulting from their approval of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall not take any action directly or indirectly
to disaffirm or adversely affect the provisions of the articles of
organization and bylaws and any other written agreements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that provide indemnification of and expense reimbursement to
the DandO Indemnified Parties.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Release of Guarantees_. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the release of any director,
officer, employee or Equityholder and their respective Affiliates that are a
party to any guarantee, performance bond, bid bond and other similar agreement
with respect to the obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including
those listed on _Schedule 5.13_ of the Disclosure Schedules (the "
_Guarantees_ "). In the event any of the Guarantees are not released prior to
or at the Closing, the Acquiror will indemnify and hold such director,
officer, employee or Equityholder and their respective Affiliates, as the case
may be, harmless for any and all payments required to be made under, and costs
and expenses incurred in connection with, such Guarantee by such director,
officer, employee or Equityholder or their respective Affiliates until such
Guarantee is released.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Delivery of FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Acquiror a certificate
pursuant to Treasury Regulations

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h) establishing that the Company is not,
nor has it been, a U.S. real property holding company (as defined in Section
897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c) of the Code, and a copy of the notice provided to the IRS in accordance
with the provisions of Section 1.897-2(h)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Closing Date Payment Allocation Schedule_. At least three
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to
each of the Acquiror and the Escrow and Paying Agent (a) a schedule (and
thereafter through the Closing any interim updates to such schedule as
necessary for the information reflected thereon to be accurate in all material
respects as of the Closing Date) (each, a " _Closing Date Payment Allocation
Schedule_ " ) setting forth for each Equityholder: (i) such Equityholders
name; (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Equityholder immediately prior to the Closing Date; (iii) the number of shares
of Company Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Company Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and
Company Series A-3 Preferred Stock held by such Equityholder immediately prior
to the Closing Date; (iv) the number of shares of Company Liquidation Stock
held by such Equityholder immediately prior to the Closing Date; (v) the
number of Options that are held by such Equityholder and that are In-the-Money
Options as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; (vi) the number of
Warrants that are held by such Equityholder and that are In-the-Money Warrants
as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; (vii) the portion of such Closing
Merger Consideration to be paid to such Equityholder by the Escrow and Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation; and (viii) the Offset Amount in respect to
such Equityholder; and (b) a copy of the Preliminary Closing Statement. The
Closing Date Payment Allocation Schedule, when delivered to the Acquiror and
the Escrow and Paying Agent, will be true and complete in all material
respects as of the Closing, and the payments to the Equityholders described
therein will be the correct payments to be made to the Equityholders in
accordance with the Companys Organizational Documents, the Company
Stockholders Agreement and this Agreement. The Company will also provide a
flow of funds memo providing the payment instructions and estimates of the
amounts payable to the Persons to who the Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated
Other Seller Expenses, Estimated Transaction Expenses and Estimated PBG
Payment Amount, as reflected on the Preliminary Closing Statement, are
payable.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Stock Option Plans; Warrants_. Neither the Acquiror, the Sub,
nor the Surviving Corporation will assume any Options or Warrants. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to cancel all Options and Warrants effective
as of the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.17 _No Shop_. Throughout the period that begins on the date hereof
and ends upon the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company will not, and the Company will
cause each of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Equityholders and any
Representative of any of the foregoing not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, seek or encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer from,
furnish any information to or participate in any discussion or negotiation
with any Person (other than Acquiror, Sub or any Person on Acquirors or Subs
behalf) regarding any acquisition of any of the Companys (or any Subsidiary
of the Companys) capital stock, or all or substantially all of its or their
assets (by purchase, merger, tender offer, statutory share exchange, joint
venture or otherwise), except sales of inventory or other assets in the
Ordinary Course of Business of the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company).
The Company will, and the Company will cause each of its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates and Equityholders and any Representative of any of the

 



       
 

 



 

foregoing to, immediately terminate all such discussions or negotiations that
may be in progress on the date hereof.

 



 

 ** 
****TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall prepare, execute and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that are filed on or before the Closing Date. The Company shall be responsible
for and shall timely pay all Taxes payable with respect to such Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) The Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for
preparing any Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for
any Tax period commencing before and ending after the Closing Date (each, a "
_Straddle Period_ ") and any Tax Returns with respect to any period ending on
or before the Closing Date that are to be filed after the Closing Date (and
for any period ending on or before the Closing Date, _provided_ that the cost
of preparation of such Tax Returns will be reimbursed from the funds in the
Escrow Account to the extent that such costs are reasonable and are approved
by the Stockholder Representative in writing prior to being incurred). The
Acquiror and the Company shall prepare such Tax Returns in accordance with
past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws. The Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation agree to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to file Tax
Returns for periods ending on or before the Closing Date to carry back net
operating losses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for periods ending on or
before the Closing Date to prior Tax periods and to claim Tax refunds
resulting from a carryback of such losses, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. The federal Income Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for 2014 shall be prepared by the Acquiror on the basis that the
taxable year of the Company and its Subsidiaries will end at the end of the
day on the Closing Date to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) and -76(b)(2)(i). Deductions with respect to
Transaction Expenses, Other Seller Expenses, the PBG Payment Amount and other
amounts payable by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including amounts that are related to
compensation (such as bonuses and severance payments), and the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Options, shall be included in Tax Returns
for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. In the case of any Straddle Period: (i) any real, personal and
intangible property Taxes attributable to the pre-Closing portion of the
Straddle Period shall be equal to the amount of such property taxes for such
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the period prior to
Closing and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period; and (ii) all other Taxes attributable to the pre-Closing portion of
the Straddle Period shall be determined based on an actual closing of the
books used to calculate such Taxes as if such tax period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date. In the case of clause (ii), exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions computed as if the Closing Date was
the last day of the Straddle Period) shall be allocated between the portion of

 



      
 

 



 

the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle
Period thereafter in proportion to the number of days in each such portion.

 



 

(c) No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing Tax
Returns referred to in Section 6.1(b), the Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation shall make such Tax Returns available for review by the
Stockholder Representative to provide the Stockholder Representative with an
opportunity to comment on such Tax Returns, but such comments shall be made
only to the extent the Taxes shown on such Tax Return could give rise to
indemnification under Article IX or the Equityholders could be entitled to any
Tax Refunds attributable to such Tax Return, or such Tax Returns may impact
Taxes that could give rise to indemnification under Article IX or Tax Refunds
to which they are entitled. If the Stockholder Representative disputes any
item on any of such Tax Returns, the Stockholder Representative shall notify
the Acquiror of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection
within twenty (20) days of the receipt of such Tax Return. The Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand, shall attempt in good faith mutually to
resolve any disagreement regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date of
filing thereof. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within a ten
(10) day period, the parties shall retain the services of an accounting firm
having a national reputation that is acceptable to the Stockholder
Representative and the Acquiror to resolve the dispute with such resolution
being final and binding upon the parties. Upon resolution of all such
disputes, the relevant Tax Return shall be timely filed on that basis. The
cost of such accounting firm shall be borne one-half by the Acquiror and one-
half by the Equityholders.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Amending of Tax Returns_. Without the prior written consent of
the Stockholder Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld), the Acquiror
and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend (and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to amend) any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries
relating to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period if such amendment would give rise to indemnification by the
Stockholder Representative under Article IX, impact the Tax Amount or have a
material effect on Tax Refunds to which the Equityholders are entitled.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Tax Refunds_. Any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (including the pre-closing portion of any Straddle Period) that
are (i) refunded to the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) credited against
Taxes of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their Affiliates, other than any
refunds of or credits against any Tax that are (x) attributable to a loss,
credit or other Tax attribute arising in periods beginning after the Closing
Date, (y) paid by the Acquiror or the Company post-Closing that are not
indemnified under Article IX (" _Tax Refunds_ ") shall promptly be paid over
to the Escrow and Paying Agent for subsequent distribution to the
Equityholders pursuant to Section 2.17 (except to the extent that such Tax
Refunds are taken into account in arriving at Closing Net Working Capital).
The Acquiror and Surviving Corporation will not elect to waive any carry back
of net operating losses under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code (and comparable
provisions of state, local or foreign tax laws) with respect to any Tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and will carry back net operating
losses with respect to any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
to prior Tax periods to the extent permitted by applicable Tax laws. If the
Stockholder Representative requests that the Company make a claim for Tax
Refunds on behalf of the Company/or and its Subsidiaries with respect to a
period (or

 



      
 

 



 

portion thereof) ending on or prior to Closing (to which Tax Refund the
Equityholders are entitled under this Section 6.3), the Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate in connection therewith, including the
preparation of any Tax Return that is required to be filed by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the
Stockholder Representative, solely on behalf of the Equityholders, agrees to
pay all reasonable expenses incurred by Acquiror or Surviving Corporation in
connection with such claim for Tax Refund with funds from the Escrow Account
and (b) such claim for Tax Refund is in accordance with applicable law and
will not have an adverse effect on the Company, either by creating potential
additional liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to
which there is or will be no right of indemnification under _Article IX_ or
by adversely affecting Taxes of the Company for a period ending after the
Closing. If such claim may have an adverse effect on the Taxes of the Company,
the Company may cooperate in making a claim for refund if the Equityholders
agree to indemnify the Company for such adverse effects and the parties can
agree on the amount of the potential adverse effect and upon a mutually
satisfactory escrow arrangement to facilitate indemnification. For the sake of
clarity, a carry back of net operating losses for periods ending on or before
the Closing Date to prior tax periods and any Tax refunds resulting from a
carry back of such losses shall be deemed not to have an adverse effect on the
Company. In the event that the parties cannot agree on whether a claim for
refund would have an adverse effect on the Company, they will resolve the
dispute in accordance with the procedure described in Section 6.1(c) hereof.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Controversies_.

 



 

(a) Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly notify the
Stockholder Representative in writing upon receipt by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of notice of any Tax audits,
examinations, assessments, or other Tax proceedings that could give rise to
indemnification with respect to Tax matters or that could impact Tax Refunds
to which the Equityholders are entitled under this Agreement. The Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to control the portion of any such audit,
examination or proceeding (including court proceedings) that relates to Taxes
that could give rise to indemnification under Article IX, the Tax Amount or
Tax Refunds to which the Equityholders are entitled under this Agreement. The
Stockholder Representative will not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any Tax proceeding that affects or may affect the Tax liability of
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of the foregoing for any
period ending after the Closing Date, including the portion of a period
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Acquiror and the Company shall, at their own expense, have the opportunity to
participate in any such audit, examination or proceeding that is controlled by
the Stockholder Representative (including being present at all meetings with
the relevant Tax authority and at all other proceedings).

 



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall control any audit,
examination, or proceeding (or portion thereof) that relates to Taxes that are
not controlled by the Stockholder Representative under Section 6.4(a) above
(including cases in which the Stockholder Representative elects not to control
the proceeding). To the extent that any such audit, examination or proceeding
relates to Taxes that could give rise to indemnification under

 



      
 

 



 

Article IX or relates to the Tax Amount or Tax Refunds to which the
Equityholders are entitled under this Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to participate in any such audit,
examination or proceeding (which participation right shall include being
present at all meetings with the relevant Tax authority and at all other
proceedings) limited solely to the portion of such audit, examination or
proceeding with respect to which indemnity is provided under this Agreement or
Tax Refund to which Equityholders are entitled under this Agreement, and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not settle any such Tax claim
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.4, this Section 6.4 shall govern the conduct of
all audits, examinations, assessments or proceedings (including court
proceedings), in each case relating to Tax matters.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Acquiror, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the Stockholder Representative shall, and
shall cause their respective representatives to, (a) provide each other party
and their respective representatives with such assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or
other examination by any taxing authority or judicial or administrative
proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (b) retain and provide each other party and their respective
representatives with reasonable access to all records or information that may
be relevant to such Tax Return (including, without limitation, analysis
regarding any Tax Refunds, audit, examination or proceeding).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
all sales (including bulk sales), use, transfer, recording, ad valorem,
privilege, documentary, gross receipts, conveyance, excise, license, stamp,
duties or similar Taxes and fees (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), if any incurred in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
equally by the Equityholders, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other
hand. The party on whom the Transfer Tax is imposed shall prepare and timely
file all relevant Tax Returns, if any, to be filed in respect of such Transfer
Taxes.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Tax Benefits For Pre-Closing Items_. The Acquiror and the Company
shall pay to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Equityholders,
the amount of any reduction in Taxes payable (Tax refunds to be received) by
the Acquiror, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates or successors
for any period (or portion thereof) commencing after the Closing Date
attributable to (a) any federal net operating losses or federal tax credits of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the period ending on the Closing Date
(including the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period) that may be carried
over to periods commencing after the Closing Date (including the post-Closing
portion of any Straddle Period) to the extent such net operating losses or tax
credits are attributable to any Schedule 6.7 Expenses, or (b) any Schedule 6.7
Expenses that are treated as a deduction on the Tax Returns of the Acquiror,
the Company or their respective Affiliates or successors for periods ending
after the Closing Date, in each case as allowed by applicable Law. For
purposes of this Section 6.7, the Acquiror, the Company and any of their
respective Affiliates shall be deemed to have realized a reduction in cash
Taxes paid (or received a Tax refund) for a particular taxable year if, and to
the extent that the liability for Taxes of the Acquiror, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates, calculated by excluding

 



      
 

 



 

any Tax items attributable to the items set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of
this Section 6.7 for such taxable year, exceeds the actual liability for Taxes
of the Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, calculated
by taking into account any such Tax items, treating such Tax items as the last
items claimed for such taxable year. The Acquiror shall pay, or cause to be
paid, any amounts owed by it pursuant to this Section 6.7 no later than 30
days after the due date (taking into account applicable extensions) of the Tax
Return for such taxable year.

requesting termination to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been the cause of the failure of such condition to be satisfied on or
prior to such date;

 



 

(d) by either the Company or the Acquiror if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by September 30, 2014; _provided_ , that the right to terminate

****INDEMNIFICATION**

representation and warranty, solely to the extent and scope of such claim,
shall continue and be extended until such claim is fully and finally resolved.
All covenants and agreements shall survive the Closing for the period provided
in such covenant or agreement, if any, or otherwise until fully performed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the Claims
Expiration Date, the only remedy that shall be available with respect to such
covenants and

 



      
 

 



 

agreements shall be non-monetary specific performance. The survival periods
set forth herein are in lieu of, and the parties expressly waive, any
otherwise applicable statute of limitations.

Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives (each an " _Indemnitee_ " and

held harmless solely from the funds in the Escrow Account against any Damages
incurred by any Indemnitee caused by:

 



 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in
Article III (without giving effect to any "material", "materially",

any such representation or warranty, other than the representations or
warranties set forth in Sections 3.6 (Financial Statements), 3.7 (Absence of
Certain Changes or Events), 3.23 (Material Suppliers and Customers) and the
definition of Material Contracts) as if such representation or warranty was
made on and as of the Closing Date (in each case, other than those made as of
a specified date other than the Closing Date, which shall be true and correct
in all respects as of such date);

 



 

(b) any breach, non-fulfillment, or non-performance of any covenant,
agreement, or obligation of the Company set forth in this Agreement or any
agreement, certificate or instrument executed and delivered by or on behalf of
the Company on the Closing Date or pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(c) Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (except to the extent that such Taxes were taken

Consideration or the adjustment of the Merger Consideration, if any, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.13_);

 



 

(d) the exercise by any Company Stockholder of appraisal rights under the
DGCL, but solely to the extent any payment pursuant to such appraisal rights
to such Company Stockholder is in excess of the amount the Company Stockholder
would have received for its Shares under this Agreement and any costs and
expenses related thereto;

 



 

(e) any claim made by a Company Stockholder or other Equityholder in its
capacity as a Company Stockholder or other Equityholder (other than to the
extent the facts or circumstances giving rise to such claim occur following
Closing);

 



 

(f) any breach by the Company prior to the Closing Date of (i) the Nasseri
Prop 65 Settlement Agreement or (ii) the Delacruz Settlement Agreement; or

 



 

(g) any unpaid Transaction Expenses, Other Seller Expenses or Indebtedness,
except to the extent any such amounts were either (i) taken into account in
arriving at the calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration or the
adjustment of the Merger Consideration, if any, as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.13, or (ii) known at the time of such calculation or adjustment
and not taken into account in such calculation or adjustment, as the case may
be;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , that the process described in Section 2.13 shall be the
exclusive remedy with respect to any dispute regarding the calculation of the
Closing Merger Consideration or the adjustment of the Merger Consideration and
no Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified with respect to any
disagreement with or claim of harm related to the process described in Section
2.13, including any determination of the Independent Accounting Firm made in
accordance with Section 2.13. For purposes of this Article IX, the portion of
Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall, in the case of a
Straddle Period, be determined in accordance with Section 6.1(b).

 



 

Section 9.3 _Limitation on Liability and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) No claim for indemnification or Damages may be asserted by any Indemnitee
under Section 9.2 unless written notice of such claim or Damages is received
by the Stockholder Representative prior to the Claims Expiration Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages that may be
recovered by the Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.2 shall be equal to the
Escrow Amount;

 



 

(ii) from and after the Closing, the right of an Indemnitee to be indemnified
from the funds in the Escrow Account pursuant to this Article IX shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any claim for indemnification or
Damages under Section 9.2;

 



 

(iii) the right of indemnification for Damages provided for in Section 9.2
shall not apply unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages
that may be recovered under Section 9.2 equals or exceeds (A) one million,
five-hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) (the " _Financial Statement Basket_
"), with respect to any claims for indemnification or Damages arising solely
and exclusively from a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.6 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent not arising from a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in any other section of Article III), or (B) three
million dollars ($3,000,000) (the " _General Basket_ ") with respect to all
other claims for indemnification or Damages, and in each case, the Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent the amount of
indemnifiable Damages exceeds the Financial Statement Basket or the General
Basket, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no indemnifiable Damages
may be claimed by any Indemnitee or shall be reimbursable pursuant to Section
9.2 or shall be included in calculating the aggregate indemnifiable Damages
for purposes of determining whether the Financial Statement Basket or General
Basket have been exceeded pursuant to this clause (iii) other than
indemnifiable Damages in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
(the " _Minimum Loss Amount_ ") resulting from any single claim or aggregated
claims arising out of the same or substantially similar facts, events or
circumstances;

 



 

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
requirement in Section 9.3(b)(iii) that the aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Damages exceed the General Basket or the Minimum Loss Amount and that the
Indemnitee be entitled to

 



       
 

 



 

indemnification only to the extent the amount of indemnifiable Damages exceeds
the General Basket or the Minimum Loss Amount shall not apply to indemnifiable
Damages incurred by any Indemnitee arising from (A) any breach or inaccuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1 (Organization
and Qualification), 3.2 (Authority), 3.3 (No Conflict; Required Filings and
Consents), 3.4 (Capitalization) or 3.19 (Brokers), (B) claims under Sections
9.2(b), 9.2(c), 9.2(d), 9.2(e), 9.2(f), and 9.2(g) and (C) intentional fraud;

 



 

(v) the indemnification provided for in Section 9.2 shall not apply with
respect to any Damages to the extent that (i) a specific accrual or reserve
for the amount of such Damage was reflected on the Unaudited Financial
Statements, the Financial Statements or the notes thereto or (ii) such Damages
(or the obligation, liability, loss or fact giving rise to such Damages) arise
or result from the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the identification of Acquiror as the purchaser of the Company;

 



 

(vi) the indemnification provided for in Section 9.2 shall not apply with
respect to any Damages (including Taxes) to the extent that such Damages (or
the obligation, liability, loss or fact giving rise to such Damages) were
taken into account in arriving at the calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration or the adjustment of the Merger Consideration, if any, as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.13; and

 



 

(vii) an Indemnitee shall not have the right to indemnification for a
multiplier of any specific amount of Damages or any punitive, special or
indirect damages.

 



 

(c) The amount of any and all Damages under this Article IX shall be
determined net of (i) any Tax benefit available to the applicable Indemnitee
or its Affiliates arising in connection with accrual, incurrence or payment of
any such Damages that is received in cash or as direct offset to any Tax of
the Company in the year that such Damages are paid or accrued, the prior year
or the two ensuing years and (ii) any insurance proceeds actually received by
an Indemnitee from a third-party insurer (after giving effect to any
deductible) for the Damages giving rise to the right of indemnification (less
any directly related out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees resulting from or
incurred in connection with such insurance claim or claims, including the
aggregate out-of-pocket cost of pursuing any related insurance claims and any
direct and correspondent increases in insurance premiums or other charge
backs). In determining whether a Tax benefit results from the payment or
accrual of Damages, all other items of expense, deduction and loss of the
Company and its Subsidiaries then existing shall be taken into account prior
to the Damages. The existence or potential existence of monies from an insurer
shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification
provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing to an
Indemnitee, it being understood that the Indemnitee shall have no obligation
to first seek recovery from a third party or submit or to collect upon any
applicable insurance coverage as a precondition to making a claim for
indemnification hereunder or obtaining indemnification for Damages thereof.
Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable
insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnifiable Damages.

 



 

(d) Any indemnity for Tax matters (other than with respect to a breach or
inaccuracy of Section 3.16(m)) is limited solely to Taxes for any period
ending on or before the Closing Date or the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period, and the Indemnitees are not

 



      
 

 



 

entitled to indemnification for any Taxes resulting from any transaction
outside the Ordinary Course of Business undertaken at the direction of the
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date or after the Closing
(including, without limitation, an election under Section 338 of the Code or
any action taken by the Acquiror that would result in an actual or deemed
liquidation of the Company effective on or before the Closing Date).

 



 

(e) The Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Stockholder Representative with respect to resolving any claim, liability
or indemnifiable Damages for which indemnification may be required hereunder,
including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such
claim, liability or indemnifiable Damage. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek full recovery from a third party and/or under all insurance policies
covering any indemnifiable Damage to the same extent as it would if such
indemnifiable Damage were not subject to indemnification hereunder. The out-
of-pocket costs and expenses of the efforts to mitigate any such claim,
liability or indemnifiable Damages that are entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall be included in the amount of indemnifiable Damages.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Section, this Agreement, or otherwise shall limit or
prohibit any right, claims, defenses, causes of action or remedies of any
Indemnitee for intentional fraud or non-monetary specific performance.

 



 

Sectioin 9.4 _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Procedure for Non-Third Party Claims_. Any Indemnitee seeking to be
indemnified pursuant to Section 9.2, other than with respect to a Third Party
Claim, shall give to the Stockholder Representative a written notice of such
claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") in accordance with Section 9.3(a), describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances giving rise to, and the nature
of, such claim, and including the amount or method of computation of the
amount of Damages relating to such claim (if then known), a reference to the
provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based and such other
information with respect thereto as the Stockholder Representative may
reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not
result in a waiver of indemnification, except to the extent that the
Stockholder Representative was damaged or prejudiced by such failure. The
Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of
such notice to respond to such Direct Claim. The Indemnitee shall allow the
Stockholder Representative and its professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Stockholder
Representatives investigation by giving such information and assistance
(including access to the Surviving Corporations premises and personnel and
the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Stockholder Representative or any of its professional advisors may reasonably
request. If the Stockholder Representative does not respond within such thirty
(30) day period, the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Procedure for Third Party Claims._

 



 

(i) Any Indemnitee seeking to be indemnified pursuant to Section 9.2 with
respect to a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnitee (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), shall give the Stockholder Representative written
notice of such Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.3(a) describing
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances giving rise to, and the
nature of, such Third Party Claim, and including the amount or method of
computation of the amount of Damages relating to such claim (if then known), a
reference to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based
and such other information with respect thereto as the Stockholder
Representative may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not result in a waiver of indemnification, except to the extent
that the Stockholder Representative was damaged or prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(ii) The Stockholder Representative shall have the right, upon written notice
to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the
Indemnitee of such Third Party Claim, to irrevocably assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by the Stockholder Representative and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If the Stockholder Representative assumes the
defense of such Third Party Claim, (A) the attorneys fees, other
professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs incurred by
the Stockholder Representative in connection with defending such Third Party
Claim shall be payable by the Stockholder Representative, solely on behalf of
the Equityholders, from the Escrow Account, (B) the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to monitor and participate in such defense at its sole expense, (C)
the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitee shall not be entitled to be indemnified for any such fees or
expenses, (D) the Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Stockholder Representative in such defense and make
available to the Stockholder Representative all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnitees possession or under the
Indemnitees control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the
Stockholder Representative, provided that in no event shall any Indemnitee
have an obligation to provide such records, materials and information that are
subject to the attorney-client privilege unless the parties have entered into
an appropriate joint defense agreement, and (E) the Stockholder Representative
shall not enter into any agreement providing for the settlement or compromise
of such Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect
to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Indemnitee
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such settlement
agreement imposes on the Indemnitee any obligation other than an obligation to
pay cash only Damages from the Escrow Account in an amount not to exceed the
amount remaining in the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Stockholder Representative shall not enter into a
settlement without the prior written consent of Indemnitee (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability and obligation with
respect to such Third Party Claim, and Stockholder Representative shall not
consent to entry of any judgment that imposes any injunctive relief or other
obligations or restrictions of any kind or nature on Indemnitee. If the
Stockholder Representative assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Stockholder Representatives prior written
consent.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to assume the defense of, or
settle, but may participate in, a Third Party Claim, (A) to the extent such
Third Party Claim seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnitee or other
material non-monetary damages, restrictions or limitations on the Indemnitee
or the Surviving Corporations and/or any Subsidiarys business, other than
non-disparagement, non-disclosure and other customary settlement terms, (B)
that involves criminal allegations against the Indemnitee, (C) that, if
unsuccessful, would reasonably be expected to exceed the amount remaining in
the Escrow Account, or (D) that relates to the subject matter of the final
sentence of Section 3.15(a). In such cases, to the extent indemnifiable under
this Agreement, the Indemnitee will still be entitled to indemnification from
the Escrow Account for such Third Party Claim and the Stockholder
Representative shall provide reasonable cooperation in connection with such
defense or prosecution. In the event the Stockholder Representative is not
entitled to assume the defense of an indemnifiable Third Party Claim pursuant
to this Section 9.4(b)(iii), the Indemnitee shall (A) with counsel of its
choice, diligently defend, conduct and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim and (B) have the right to settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim with the prior written
consent of the Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(iv) Each party to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate and cause its employees to cooperate with and assist the Indemnitee
and the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be, in connection with the
defense or prosecution of any indemnifiable Third Party Claim.

 



 

(v) If the Stockholder Representative elects not to assume the defense with
respect to any Third Party Claim or fails to give the written notice required
by Section 9.4(b)(ii) or contests its obligation to indemnify an Indemnitee,
the Indemnitee may assume the defense with respect to such Third Party Claim
and defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim; provided that to the extent the Indemnitee intends to seek
indemnification for such Third Party Claim, any settlement that involves an
admission of wrongdoing (criminal or otherwise) with respect to the Company or
any of its Equityholders, former directors, officers or employees shall
require the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, not to be
unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnitee defends against any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for all Damages
paid or incurred in connection therewith to the extent such Damages are
indemnifiable Damages.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnitee receives any payment
from the Escrow Account in respect of any Damages pursuant to Section 9.2 and
the Indemnitee could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third
party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying indemnification
claim, the Indemnitee shall assign, on a non-recourse basis and without any
representation or warranty, such of its rights to proceed against the
Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment. Any payment received in respect of
such claim against the Potential Contributor (by the Stockholder
Representative) shall be deposited with the Escrow and Paying Agent for
distribution, (a) first, in the case of any claim by a Indemnitee as provided
in the immediately preceding sentence, to the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitee in the amount of any costs and expenses incurred in investigating,
prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such claim, (b) second, to the
Equityholders, pursuant to Section 2.17, in an amount equal to the aggregate
payments made from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee in respect of such
claim, plus the costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting,
defending or otherwise addressing such claim and (c) the balance, if any, to
the Indemnitee.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Escrow Account_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Acquiror shall pay the Escrow Amount to the Escrow and
Paying Agent, in immediately available funds, for deposit in the Escrow
Account, to be held by the Escrow and Paying Agent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In accordance herewith, the
Escrow Amount shall be available to any Indemnitee (i) as the sole source of
payment and remedy, after exhaustion of the Net Adjustment Holdback Amount,
for the unpaid portion of any Net Adjustment Amount in excess of the Net
Adjustment Holdback Amount, and (ii) as the sole source of payment and remedy
for any and all claims asserted hereunder, including for indemnification or
Damages for which any Indemnitee is entitled to recovery pursuant to Article
VI or this Article IX. For the avoidance of doubt, the Net Adjustment Holdback
Account and the Net Adjustment Holdback Amount shall only be available to the
Acquiror for payment of any Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section
2.13(g)(iii), and shall under no circumstances be available as a source of
payment or remedy by any Indemnitee for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) Following the Claims Expiration Date and upon final resolution of all then
pending indemnification obligations and reimbursement of all expenses of the
Stockholder Representative, as provided in Section 2.16(b), the Escrow and
Paying Agent shall distribute any remaining portion of the Escrow Amount to
the Equityholders in accordance with Section 2.17.

 



 

Sectioin 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, this Article IX will
provide the exclusive remedy for the Indemnitees for any breach, inaccuracy,
non-fulfillment or non-performance of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. No current or former director, officer,
employee, Affiliate or Representative of the Company or any Subsidiary, in
their capacities as such, or any Equityholder shall have any liability of any
nature to an Indemnitee, and no Indemnitee shall have recourse against any
current or former director, officer, employee, Affiliate or Representative of
the Company or any Subsidiary, in their capacities as such, or any
Equityholder or their Affiliates, with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in, or any other
claims based upon, arising out of, or otherwise in respect of this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article IX limits any Persons
rights or obligations under any Letter of Transmittal or any
Consulting/Employment Agreement or any Restrictive Covenant Agreement.

delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of the Acquiror (in the case of an
assignment by the Company) or the Company (in the case of an assignment by the

entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Delaware State
or federal court sitting in New Castle County (or, if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate Delaware State or federal court), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.16 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein.

 



 

Section 10.17 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

Section 10.18 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 



 

Section 10.19 _Facsimile or .pdf Signature_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature shall constitute
an original for all purposes.

 



 

Section 10.20 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all
dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.21 _Legal Representation_. The Acquiror, Sub, the Company and their
respective Affiliates acknowledge and agree that each of Gibson Dunn and
Crutcher LLP (" _Gibson Dunn_ "), Ropes and Gray LLP (" _Ropes and Gray_"),
Shearman and Sterling LLP (" _Shearman and Sterling")_ or other counsel
(collectively, " _Prior Company Counsel_ ") has acted as counsel for certain
of the Company Stockholders, the Company and their respective Affiliates for
several years and that such Company Stockholders reasonably anticipate that
Gibson Dunn, Ropes and Gray, Shearman and Sterling and such other counsel will
continue to represent them in future matters. Accordingly, the Acquiror, Sub,
the Company and their respective Affiliates expressly: (a) consent to Prior
Company Counsels representation of the Company Stockholders and/or the

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholder Representative in any post-Closing matter in which the interests
of the Acquiror, Sub and the Company, on the one hand, and the Company
Stockholders or the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, are
adverse, including, without limitation, any matter relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or any disagreement or
dispute relating thereto (the " _Transaction Matters_ ") and (b) consent to
the disclosure by Prior Company Counsel to the Company Stockholders, the
Stockholder Representative or their Affiliates in connection with the
Transaction Matters of any information learned by Prior Company Counsel in the
course of its representation of the Company, the Company Stockholders or their
respective Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to attorney-
client privilege or Prior Company Counsels duty of confidentiality.
Furthermore, the Acquiror and the Company irrevocably waive any right they may
have to discover or obtain information or documentation relating to the
representation of the Company or the Company Stockholders by Prior Company
Counsel in connection with the Transaction Matters, to the extent that such
information or documentation was privileged as to the Company or the Company
Stockholders. The Acquiror, Sub, the Company and their respective Affiliates
further covenant and agree that each shall not assert any claim against Prior
Company Counsel in respect of legal services provided to the Company or its
Affiliates by Prior Company Counsel in connection with the Transaction
Matters. Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with Gibson Dunn, Ropes and Gray, Shearman and
Sterling and such other counsel, unless and to the extent Gibson Dunn, Ropes and
Gray, Shearman and Sterling or such other counsel is specifically engaged in
writing by the Company to represent the Company after the Closing and either
such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to the Company
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative or their Affiliates or the
Company Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative or their Affiliates, as
applicable, consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such
representation of the Company by Prior Company Counsel after the Closing shall
not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. If and to the extent that, at any
time subsequent to Closing, the Acquiror, Sub, the Company or their Affiliates
shall have the right to assert or waive an attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication between the Company or its Affiliates and any
Person representing them relating in any manner to the Transaction Matters,
the Acquiror, Sub, the Company or any of their Affiliates shall be entitled to
waive such privilege only with the prior written consent of the Company
Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld). This Section 10.21 is for the benefit of the Company
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative and Prior Company Counsel, and
the Company Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative and Prior Company
Counsel are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 10.21. This
Section 10.21 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 10.21 may be
amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the Company
Stockholders and Prior Company Counsel affected thereby.

 



 

Section 10.22 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the Acquiror,
Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or
any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.
