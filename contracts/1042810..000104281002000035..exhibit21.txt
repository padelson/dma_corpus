Agreement, articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") shall be duly
prepared, executed and acknowledged by the Surviving Corporation (as defined

Taxation of Maryland (the "SDAT") for filing as provided in Section 3-107 of
the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended (the "MGCL"), and the
Secretary of State of the State of Georgia for filing as provided in Section
14-2-1105 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code, as amended (the "GBCC"),
as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined in Section
1.2). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing and acceptance for
record of the Articles of Merger with the SDAT and the Georgia Secretary
of State, or at such other date and time subsequent thereto as expressly
provided in the Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time").   SECTION 1.2
Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time, no later than the third business day next following the waiver
or satisfaction, as applicable, of the last to occur of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (the "Closing Date"), at such date, time and place as is
mutually agreed to by the parties hereto.   SECTION 1.3 Effects of the
Merger.   (a) At the Effective Time, IRT shall be merged with and into the
Company, and thereupon, the separate corporate existence of IRT shall cease
and the Company shall survive and continue to exist as a Maryland corporation

Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the MGCL and GBCC; to
wit, without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time, all of the property, assets, businesses, rights,
interests, privileges, powers, licenses and franchises of IRT thereupon shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of IRT
("Liabilities") thereupon shall become the Liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and IRT may,
upon mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, change the
method of effecting the combination of the Company and IRT (including,
without limitation, the provisions of this Article I) if and to the extent
they deem such change to be desirable, including, without limitation, to
provide for a merger of IRT directly with and into a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, in which either IRT or such subsidiary is the surviving
corporation; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change
the amount, method of calculating or kind of Merger Consideration (as defined
below) to be issued to holders of IRT Common Stock (as defined below) as
provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of
IRT\'s shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration, or
(iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.    2    SECTION 1.4 Organizational

of Incorporation" of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective
Time until thereafter duly amended or restated in accordance with the MGCL.

Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until thereafter duly
amended or restated in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the MGCL.   SECTION 1.5 Directors.
All of the directors of the Company plus one director of IRT who shall be
elected to the Company\'s board of directors in accordance with Section 5.16
below shall constitute the entire board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation. Each such director shall hold office in accordance with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such
director\'s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified.   SECTION
1.6 Officers. The officers of the Company shall be the officers of the

ARTICLE II   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; CONVERSION  AND
EXCHANGE OF CAPITAL STOCK   SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company or IRT:  
(a) Common Stock of the Company. Each share of common stock of the
Company, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain issued and outstanding
and unaffected by the Merger, and, together with the securities converted
into Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and the shares of
Company Common Stock issued in the Private Placement, shall constitute all of
the then-issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Certain Stock. All shares of common stock
of IRT, par value $1.00 per share (the "IRT Common Stock"), together with all
associated "Rights" issued under that certain IRT Shareholders Protection
Rights Agreement dated as of August 21, 1998, as amended to the Effective
Time (the "IRT Rights Agreement"), between IRT and SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, as
rights agent, that are owned or held by IRT as treasury stock and all shares
of IRT Common Stock owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of IRT or the
Company (collectively, "Treasury Stock"), shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no capital stock or other interests of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any other consideration
(whether consisting of cash, property, or any combination thereof) shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.    3    As used in this Agreement, a
"Subsidiary" of any Person (as defined herein) means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other legal
entity of which such Person owns or holds (either directly or through or
together with another Subsidiary of such Person) either (i) a general
partner, managing member or other similar interest, or (ii)(A) 10% or more of
the voting power of the voting capital stock or other voting
equity interests, or (B) 10% or more of the outstanding voting capital stock
or other voting equity interests of such Person. As used in this Agreement,
"Person" means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or
other entity.   (c) Conversion Of IRT Common Stock; Merger Consideration.
Subject to the provisions of this Article II, each share of IRT Common Stock,
other than Treasury Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) $12.15 in
cash (the "Cash Consideration") or (ii) 0.9 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Stock Consideration") or (iii) the right to receive a combination of cash
and shares of Company Common Stock determined in accordance with Section 2.2
(the "Mixed Consideration"). The Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration
and the Mixed Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Company Common Stock to which a holder of IRT Common Stock has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4 ("Fractional Shares"), is referred
to collectively herein as the "Merger Consideration."   SECTION 2.2
Election Procedure.   (a) Election. Subject to Sections 2.2(b) and (f), each
record holder of shares of IRT Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive Cash Consideration (a
"Cash Election"), Stock Consideration (a "Stock Election") or Mixed
Consideration (a "Mixed Election"; Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed
Elections are collectively referred to as "Elections") for such holder\'s
shares of IRT Common Stock. Elections shall be made in accordance with
Section 2.2(c) below on a form designed for that purpose (a "Form of
Election"), which Form of Election shall be in such form as IRT and the
Company shall mutually agree.   (b) Proration. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 2.2(a) and subject to Section 2.2(f), the aggregate
number of shares of IRT Common Stock that may be converted into Cash
Consideration in the Merger (the "Cash Election Shares"), whether by Cash
Elections or Mixed Elections, together with any Fractional Shares, shall not
exceed 50% of the total number of shares of IRT Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time (the "Cash Election Number"). If the sum
of the Cash Election Shares and the Fractional Shares exceeds the
Cash Election Number, each Cash Election Share shall be converted into (i)
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) a fraction (the "Cash
Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares, and
(ii) a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the product of (A)
the Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash
Fraction.   4    (c) Form of Election. To be effective, a Form of
Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted to such paying and
exchange agent (which shall be a commercial bank or trust company) as IRT and
the Company shall mutually agree (the "Exchange Agent"), and accompanied by
the certificates representing the shares of IRT Common Stock ("Old
Certificates") as to which an Election is being made (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificate signed by a bank, broker,
dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity that is a member in
good standing of the Securities Transfer Agent\'s Medallion Program, the New
York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock
Exchange Medallion Program). A holder of record of shares of IRT Common Stock
who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another representative
capacity (a "Holder Representative") may submit multiple Forms of Election,
provided that such Holder Representative certifies that each such Form of
Election covers all the shares of IRT Common Stock held by such
Holder Representative for a particular beneficial owner. The Company shall
have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the
Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly
completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial
defects in Forms of Election. Any good faith decision of the Company (or the
Exchange Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. The Company
(or the Exchange Agent) shall, to the extent commercially practicable,
promptly notify IRT of any defect in a Form of Election other than an
immaterial defect disregarded in good faith by the Company (or the Exchange
Agent). Neither the Company nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted
to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations
contemplated by this Section 2.2, and all such computations shall be
conclusive and binding on the holders of shares of IRT Common Stock.   (d)
No Election Shares. For the purposes hereof, a holder of shares of IRT Common
Stock (the "No Election Shares") who does not submit a Form of Election that
is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline (as defined
below) shall be deemed not to have made a Cash Election, Stock Election or
Mixed Election. In addition, if the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall determine that any purported Election was not properly made, the holder
of shares IRT Common Stock subject to such improperly made Election shall
also be treated as No Election Shares. No Election Shares may be treated by
the Company in its sole discretion as Cash Election Shares or Stock Election
Shares, or a combination thereof.   (e) Election Deadline. IRT and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause copies of the
Form of Election to be mailed on the Mailing Date (as defined below) to each
holder of record of shares of IRT Common Stock (other than holders of
Treasury Stock) as of a record date which shall be the same date as the
record date for eligibility to vote on the Merger and to make the Form of
Election available to all persons who become record holders of shares of IRT
Common Stock subsequent to the date of such mailing. The "Mailing Date" shall
be the date on which proxy materials relating to the Merger are mailed to
holders of shares of IRT Common Stock. In order to be effective, a Form of
Election must be received by the Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time,
on the date immediately prior to the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting, or
such other time and date as IRT and the Company may mutually agree (the
"Election Deadline"). All Elections may be revoked in writing by the record
holders submitting Forms of Election at any time prior to the Election
Deadline.    5    (f) Tax Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article II to the contrary, the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of cash that
will be paid in the Merger as Cash Consideration, (ii) any cash amounts to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.4 for Fractional Shares, (iii) any other amounts
paid by the Company or IRT to or on behalf of any shareholder of IRT in
connection with the sale, redemption or other disposition of any shares of
capital stock of IRT in connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e) and 1.368-1T(e), and (iv) the amount of any
extraordinary dividend, including any Final IRT Dividend (as defined below),
distributed by IRT prior to and in connection with the Merger for purposes of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1T(e) (the sum of such amounts in (i) --
(iv), the "Aggregate Cash Amount") shall not exceed 60% of the Aggregate
Consideration. The "Aggregate Consideration" shall be equal to the sum of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be issued in the Merger times
the Company Closing Price, plus (ii) the Aggregate Cash Amount. The "Company
Closing Price" means the weighted average trading price per share of the
Company Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (composite transactions
list) for all transactions occurring on the Closing Date. If the Aggregate
Cash Amount as so calculated would exceed 60% of the Aggregate Consideration,
the Company shall decrease the Cash Election Number thereby increasing the
aggregate number of shares of IRT Common Stock to be exchanged for Company
Common Stock in the Merger at the Exchange Ratio on a proportionate basis
such that the Aggregate Cash Amount would not exceed 60% of the Aggregate
Consideration (the "Tax Adjustment").   SECTION 2.3 Rights As Shareholders;
Stock Transfers. At the Effective Time, holders of IRT Common Stock shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of IRT, other than to
receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to IRT Common Stock
with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Date and the Merger
Consideration provided in this Article II. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of IRT or the Surviving
Corporation of shares of IRT Common Stock.   SECTION 2.4 Fractional Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no certificates for Fractional
Shares, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger;
instead, the Company shall pay to each holder of IRT Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a Fractional Share (after taking into account all of
the shares of IRT Common Stock represented by all of the Old Certificates
delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fraction by the Company Closing Price.   SECTION 2.5
Exchange Procedures.   (a) Deposit of Exchange Fund. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of IRT
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, an amount of
cash and certificates or book-entry securities representing shares of Company
Common Stock ("New Certificates") required to effect the conversion of IRT
Common Stock into Company Common Stock and cash in accordance with Sections
2.1(c), 2.3, 2.5(b) and 2.6 (such cash and New Certificates, together with
any dividends or distributions with a record date occurring after the
Effective Date with respect thereto (without any interest on any such cash,
dividends or distributions) being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").   6    (b) Exchange of Certificates. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Date, the Company shall send or cause to be sent to each
former holder of record of shares of IRT Common Stock that did not otherwise
make an Election (other than Treasury Stock) immediately prior to the
Effective Time transmittal materials for use in exchanging such
shareholder\'s Old Certificates for the Merger Consideration set forth in
this Article II. The Company shall cause the New Certificates representing
Company Common Stock into which shares of a holder\'s IRT Common Stock are
converted on the Effective Date and/or a check in respect of the Cash
Consideration into which shares of a holder\'s IRT Common Stock are converted
at the Effective Time and any Fractional Shares or dividends or distributions
which such Person shall be entitled to receive (including any Final IRT
Dividend) to be delivered to such holder who shall have delivered to the
Exchange Agent Old Certificates (whether in connection with the Form
of Election or with the above described transmittal materials) representing
such shares of IRT Common Stock (or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and the Exchange Agent, if any of such certificates are lost, stolen
or destroyed) owned of record immediately prior to the Effective Time by
such holder. No interest will be paid on any such Cash Consideration, cash to
be paid in lieu of Fractional Shares or dividends or distributions which any
such Person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II upon
such delivery.   (c) Unclaimed Certificates. If Old Certificates are not
surrendered or consideration therefor is not claimed prior to the date on
which such consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed consideration and any
unpaid dividends or distributions thereon shall, to the extent permitted by
abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of the
Company (and to the extent not in its possession shall be paid over to the
Company), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange
Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of IRT Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (d) Distributions
in Respect of Unclaimed Certificates. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date occurring after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old
Certificate representing shares of IRT Common Stock converted in the Merger
into the right to receive shares of such Company Common Stock until the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive New Certificates in exchange
therefor after having complied with the procedures set forth in this Section
2.5, and no such shares of Company Common Stock shall be eligible to vote
until the holder of Old Certificates is entitled to receive New Certificates
after having complied with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.
After becoming so entitled and after having complied with this Section
2.5, the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had otherwise become payable with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock such holder had the right to receive upon surrender of the Old
Certificate.   (e) Disposition of Unclaimed Exchange Fund. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of IRT for
twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned by the Exchange
Agent to the Company if the Company so requests. In   7   the event of
the return of such Exchange Fund to the Company, subject to Section 2.5(c),
any shareholders of IRT who have not heretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment of the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any Fractional Shares, and unpaid
dividends and distributions on IRT Common Stock or Company Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of IRT Common Stock such shareholder
holds immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.   (f) Investment of
Exchange Fund. The Company may cause the Exchange Agent to invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund in short-term obligations of, or fully
guaranteed by, the United States of America, investment grade commercial
paper or other similar investments, but in any event the Company shall ensure
that the terms and conditions of any such investment shall be such as to
permit the Exchange Agent to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the
Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Company shall promptly
replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments
or other events, so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times,
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.   (g) Lost or
Stolen Certificates. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the receipt of a duly notarized affidavit of such
fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, (ii) the posting by such person of a bond or similar
surety instrument in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or
Exchange Agent may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Old Certificate and (iii) the receipt of any
other documents or instruments necessary to evidence and effect the exchange,
the Exchange Agent shall issue and/or pay the Merger Consideration in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate.   (h)
Withholding Taxes. The Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold) from the
Merger Consideration payable to a holder of IRT Common Stock, all withholding
and stock transfer taxes. To the extent such amounts are so withheld, they
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of IRT Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Company.   (i) Expenses of Exchange Agent. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Exchange
Agent.   SECTION 2.6 Final Dividends. If and to the extent necessary for IRT
to satisfy the requirements of Section 857(a)(1) of the Code for the taxable
year of IRT ending at the Effective Time of the Merger (and to avoid the
payment of any tax with respect to undistributed income or gain), IRT shall
declare a dividend on each share of IRT Common Stock (the "Final IRT
Dividend"), the record date for which shall be the close of business on the
last business day prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, in an amount
equal to the minimum dividend sufficient to permit IRT to satisfy such
requirements. If IRT determines that it is necessary to declare the   
8   Final IRT Dividend, IRT shall notify the Company at least 20 days prior
to the scheduled date for the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting, and the Company
shall be entitled to declare a dividend per share payable to holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock, the record date for which shall be the
close of business on the last business day prior to the Effective Time, in an
amount per share of Company Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the Final IRT Dividend paid by IRT with respect to each share of
IRT Common Stock by (y) the Exchange Ratio ("Corresponding Final Dividend").
The dividends payable hereunder to the holders of IRT Common Stock shall be
paid upon presentation of the Old Certificates for exchange in accordance
with this Article II. In addition, notwithstanding anything in Section 2.1(c)
to the contrary, following the declaration of a Final IRT Dividend in
connection with this Section 2.6, the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by
an amount equal to the per share amount of the IRT Final Dividend.  
SECTION 2.7 Adjustment of Exchange Ratio. In the event of any stock
split, combination, reclassification or stock dividend with respect to
Company Common Stock, any change or conversion of Company Common Stock into
other securities or any other dividend or distribution with respect to
Company Common Stock (other than quarterly cash dividends issued in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice, the Corresponding Final
Dividend and any dividend issued in accordance with Section 5.13(b)) and any
distribution by the Company of shares of capital stock of any of its
affiliates, or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing should
occur, prior to the Effective Time, appropriate and proportionate adjustments
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and thereafter all references in this
Agreement to the Exchange Ratio shall be deemed to be the Exchange Ratio as
so adjusted.   SECTION 2.8 Stock Options. (a) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of
IRT Common Stock (an "IRT Option") granted under any IRT Plan (as defined
below) (other than any "Stock Purchase Plan" within the meaning of Section
423 of the Code), shall, whether or not then vested or exercisable, become
and represent an option to purchase the number of shares of Company Common
Stock (an "Assumed Option") rounded up to the nearest whole share, determined
by multiplying: (x) the number of shares of IRT Common Stock subject to such
option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, at
an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock (increased to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of IRT Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio;
provided, however, that in the case of any IRT Option to which Section 421 of
the Code applies by reason of its qualification as an incentive stock option
under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted if
necessary to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. After the Effective
Time, each Assumed Option shall vest only to the extent required by the terms
of the underlying IRT Option. If no automatic vesting requirement is set
forth in the underlying IRT Option or other agreement, then the Assumed
Option shall be subject to the same vesting schedule and be exercisable upon
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related option
immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably practical, the
Company shall register under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or another
appropriate SEC form (and use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) all shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to
all Assumed Options. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Company   9   Common Stock for delivery
in connection with the Assumed Options. Schedule 2.8 of the IRT Disclosure
Memorandum contains a true and complete list of all IRT Options and shares of
restricted capital stock of IRT issued and outstanding on the date of this
Agreement and the vesting schedules and exercise prices of such IRT Options
and shares of restricted stock.   (b) The 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan of
IRT and the IRT 1989 Stock Option Plan (the "IRT Stock Option Plans") shall
be amended, to the extent necessary, to reflect the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the conversion of each
share of IRT Common Stock held or to be awarded or paid pursuant to such
benefit plans, programs or arrangements into shares of Company Common Stock
on a basis consistent with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company and IRT agree to submit the amendments to the IRT Stock Option
Plans to their respective stockholders, if such submission is determined to
be necessary by counsel to the Company or IRT after consultation with one
another; provided, however, that such approval shall not be a condition to
the consummation of the Merger.    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES   SECTION 3.1 Representations and Warranties of IRT. IRT hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as follows:   (a) Organization,
Standing and Power. (i) IRT is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Georgia, has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good standing
to transact business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be in good standing or so to qualify
would not have an IRT Material Adverse Effect. For the purposes of this
Agreement, "IRT Material Adverse Effect" shall mean an event, change
or occurrence which, individually or together with any other event, change
or occurrence, has or would have a material adverse impact on (A) the
financial position, business or results of operations of IRT and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the ability of IRT to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that an IRT Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the effect of (a) changes in
laws of general applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or other
governmental authorities, (b) changes in generally accepted accounting
principles or accounting principles generally applicable to real estate
investment trusts ("REITs"), or any standard or customary calculation of
funds from operations specified by the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), (c) general economic conditions or conditions
generally affecting the REIT industry, which in the case of (a) - (c) do not
have a materially more adverse effect on IRT than that of similarly situated
companies.   (ii) Except for shares of common stock of, or limited liability
company member interests or other similar interests ("LLC Interests") or
partnership interests or limited partnership interests ("Partnership
Interests") in, IRT\'s Subsidiaries, and except as set forth on   
10   Schedule 3.1(a)(ii) of the disclosure memorandum, dated as of the date
hereof, delivered by IRT to the Company prior to the execution of this
Agreement setting forth certain matters referred to in this Agreement (the
"IRT Disclosure Memorandum"), IRT does not own as of the date of this
Agreement of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly, (A) any shares
of outstanding capital stock, LLC Interests, Partnership Interests or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any capital
stock or LLC Interests or Partnership Interest of any other person or entity
or (B) any participating or economic interest in any partnership, joint
venture, trust or other non-corporate business enterprise ("Other Investment
Interests"). Each Subsidiary of IRT is a corporation, limited liability
company or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is
duly qualified and in good standing to transact business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
in good standing or so qualified would not have an IRT Material Adverse
Effect. Each Subsidiary of IRT as of the date of this Agreement and its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization is set forth on Schedule
3.1(a)(ii) of the IRT Disclosure Memorandum.   (iii) All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock, all LLC Interests and all Partnership Interests of
each Subsidiary of IRT, as applicable, held by IRT or a Subsidiary of IRT
have been duly authorized, are validly issued, and in the case of shares of
capital stock, fully paid and nonassessable and, except as set forth on
Schedule 3.1(a)(iii) of the IRT Disclosure Memorandum, are owned by IRT or by
a wholly owned Subsidiary of IRT, free and clear of all Liens, and there are
no proxies outstanding, shareholder agreements, voting trusts or
other agreements or restrictions on the voting, holding or transfer
("Restrictive Agreements") affecting any such shares, LLC Interests,
Partnership Interests or Other Investment Interests.   For the purposes of
this Agreement, "Lien" shall mean any conditional sale agreement, defect of
title, easement, encroachment, encumbrance, hypothecation, infringement,
lien, mortgage, pledge, reservation, restriction, security interest, title
retention or other security arrangement, or any adverse right or interest,
charge, or claim of any nature whatsoever of, on, or with respect to any
property or property interest, other than (i) Liens for current
property taxes and charges not yet due and payable, and (ii) mechanics\',
carriers\', workmen\'s, repairmen\'s and materialmen\'s Liens and other
Liens, which individually or in the aggregate, do not materially detract from
the value of, or materially interfere with the present use of, any property
or asset subject thereto or thereby or materially reduce the marketability of
any property for such use, and do not otherwise have an IRT or Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below), as applicable.   (b) Capital
Structure. The authorized capital stock of IRT consists of 150,000,000 shares
of IRT Common Stock, of which 34,197,736 shares were outstanding as of
September 30, 2002, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value
(the "IRT Preferred Stock"), none of which are outstanding. All of the
outstanding shares of IRT Common Stock have been duly authorized and
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except for (i) IRT Options
to purchase an aggregate of 928,088 shares of IRT Common Stock granted
pursuant to the IRT Plans, and outstanding as of the date hereof, and (ii)

Agreement of IRT Partners dated August 12, 1998 (the "IRT
Partners Agreement"), into an aggregate of 816,000 shares of IRT Common Stock
as of the date hereof, no arrangement, subscription, warrant, call,
commitment, agreement, scrip, understanding, option, convertible security,
stock appreciation (or depreciation) or other right (contingent or otherwise)
to purchase or acquire, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for, any shares of any class or series of capital stock ("Equity
Right") of IRT or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized or outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement and there is not outstanding or in effect as of
the date of this Agreement any commitment, agreement, plan, arrangement or
understanding (whether oral or written) of IRT or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue any such Equity Rights or to distribute to holders of any class or
series of its capital stock any evidences of indebtedness or assets. Neither
IRT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation (contingent or otherwise)
to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or
any interest therein or to pay any dividend or make any other distribution in
respect thereof (other than as required by REITs generally under the Code or
as set forth on Schedule 3.1(b) of the IRT Disclosure Memorandum). As of the
date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock, the authorized LLC
Interests, the authorized Partnership Interests and the authorized Other
Investment Interests, as applicable, of each Subsidiary of IRT consist in
their entirety of the shares, the LLC Interests, the Partnership Interests
and the Other Investment Interests described on Schedule 3.1(a)(ii) of the
IRT Disclosure Memorandum, all of which shares and interests are issued
and outstanding and owned beneficially and of record by IRT or through wholly
owned Subsidiaries of IRT. Schedule 3.1(b) of the IRT Disclosure Memorandum
lists all Restrictive Agreements affecting shares of IRT Common Stock or the
holders thereof known to IRT.   (c) Authority. IRT has all requisite power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to the IRT
Shareholder Approval (as defined below), to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of IRT
and the consummation by IRT of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of IRT, subject to the IRT Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by IRT and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of IRT enforceable against it in accordance with its terms. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation by
IRT of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material
right, entitlement or benefit under, or the creation or imposition of any
Lien on or against any assets or properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (any such conflict, breach, violation, default, right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration, loss, creation or imposition,
hereafter a "Violation") of (i) any provision of the articles of
incorporation, bylaws or analogous instruments of governance, operation or
formation of IRT or any of its Subsidiaries presently in effect or, (ii)
except as disclosed in Section 3.1(c) of the IRT Disclosure Memorandum, any
loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, lease, IRT Plan, or
other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, license, judgment, writ, order, decree, pronouncement, edict,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to IRT or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, except in the case of
this clause (ii) for any such Violation which would not   
12   reasonably be expected to have an IRT Material Adverse Effect. No
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any federal, state or local government or any court,
administrative or regulatory agency or commission or other governmental
authority or agency, domestic or foreign (each, a "Governmental Entity") is
required by or with respect to IRT or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by IRT or the consummation
by IRT of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, the failure to
obtain which would reasonably be expected to have an IRT Material Adverse
Effect, except for (i) the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") of the Form S-4 (as defined below) and the Joint Proxy Statement (as
defined below) in defefinitive form relating to the IRT Shareholders\'
Meeting to vote upon the IRT Shareholder Approval, and such reports under the
Exchange Act (as defined below) as may be required in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
and the obtaining from the SEC of such effectiveness and other orders as may
be required in respect of the Form S-4, (ii) the filing of the Articles of
Merger and such other appropriate documents with the SDAT and the Georgia
Secretary of State and other relevant authorities of jurisdictions in which
IRT is qualified to transact business, and (iii) compliance with and filings
required by the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. The
Board of Directors of IRT (the "IRT Board") has unanimously approved this
Agreement, the Merger and all of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and, subject to Sections 4.1(f)(iii) and 5.1(c)(ii) below, has
resolved unanimously to recommend that holders of IRT Common Stock approve,
adopt and vote in favor of the IRT Shareholder Approval.   (d) IRT SEC
Documents. IRT has made available to the Company a true and complete copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement
filed by IRT and each of its Subsidiaries with the SEC since January 1, 2000
(as such documents have been amended to date, the "IRT SEC Documents") which
are all the documents (other than preliminary material) that IRT was required
to file with the SEC since such date. As of their respective dates, the IRT
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations thereunder, and none of the IRT SEC
Documents contained, at the time they were filed, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the IRT
SEC Documents not constituting Securities Act Registration Statements in
light of the circumstances under which they were made), not misleading. The
consolidated financial statements of IRT included in the IRT SEC Documents
comply in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during the periods and at
the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in
the case of the unaudited or interim statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act) and fairly present (subject, in the case of the
unaudited or interim statements, to normal and recurring audit adjustments)
the consolidated financial position of IRT and its Subsidiaries as at the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations,
shareholders\' equity and cash flows for the periods then ended. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.1(d) of the IRT Disclosure Memorandum, since December
31, 2001, neither IRT nor any of its    13   Subsidiaries has incurred
any liabilities except for (i) liabilities or obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) liabilities
incurred in connection with or as a result of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby, (iii) liabilities of a type that is the subject of any
other representation of IRT, e.g., environmental or litigation matters, etc.,
and (iv) liabilities and obligations which would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, result in an IRT Material Adverse
Effect. Neither IRT nor any of its Subsidiaries has directly or indirectly
guaranteed any obligation or other liability of any third-party (other than
any affiliate of IRT as described in the IRT SEC Documents).   (e)
Information Supplied. None of the information supplied by IRT for inclusion
or (to the extent permitted by applicable rules of the SEC) incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 shall, at the time the Form S-4 is declared
effective by the SEC under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading and (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement shall, at the date first mailed to holders of
IRT Common Stock through and including the date of the IRT Shareholders\'
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact about IRT or omit to
state any material fact about IRT required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event with respect to IRT or any of its affiliates or Subsidiaries occurs
which is required to be described in any amendment of or supplement to the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, such event promptly shall be so
described and such amendment or supplement promptly shall be filed with the
SEC and, as required by applicable law (including applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange), delivered to the holders
of IRT Common Stock. The Joint Proxy Statement shall, on the date first
mailed to holders of IRT Common Stock through and including the date of the
IRT Shareholders\' Meeting, comply as to form in all material respects with
all applicable rules and regulations under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. All applications, filing and documents that IRT or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates is responsible for filing with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transaction
contemplated hereby shall comply as to form in all material respects with all
applicable laws and regulations.   (f) Compliance with Applicable Laws. IRT
and its Subsidiaries hold all consents, permits, licenses, franchises,
variances, exemptions, registrations qualifications, dispensations
concessions, orders, permissions, authorizations and approvals of all
Governmental Entities which are material to the operation of their respective
businesses (the "IRT Permits"). IRT and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms of the IRT Permits, except where the failure so to comply
would not reasonably be expected to have an IRT Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(f) of the IRT Disclosure
Memorandum, the respective businesses of IRT and its Subsidiaries are not
being conducted in violation of any statute, judgment, writ, order, decree,
edict, pronouncement, law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental
Entity, except for violations which do not, and would not reasonably be
expected to have an IRT Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review
by any Governmental Entity with respect to IRT or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or, to the knowledge of IRT, threatened, nor has any Governmental
Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same.   14    (g)
Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(g) of the IRT Disclosure
Memorandum, there is no investigation, suit, action, arbitration, complaint
or proceeding (each, a "Proceeding") pending or, to the knowledge of IRT,
threatened against or affecting IRT or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective assets, which, if determined adversely to IRT or any of
the Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to have an IRT Material
Adverse Effect; nor is there any judgment, decree, writ, order, edict,
pronouncement, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitral authority outstanding against IRT or any of its Subsidiaries having,
or which would reasonably be expected to have an IRT Material Adverse
Effect.   (h) Taxes.   (i) IRT and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
filed all material tax returns required to be filed by it and has paid (or
IRT has paid on its behalf) all taxes required to be paid as shown on such
returns. The most recent financial statements contained in the IRT SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes payable by IRT and its
Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements. Since
January 1, 1997, neither IRT nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability for taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code. No
event has occurred and no condition exists which presents a risk that any
material tax liability described in the preceding sentence could be imposed
upon IRT and its Subsidiaries. No material deficiencies for any taxes have
been proposed, asserted or assessed by any taxing jurisdiction against IRT or
any of its Subsidiaries. No requests for waivers of the time to assess taxes
are pending and no tax returns of IRT or any of its Subsidiaries have been or
are currently being audited by any taxing jurisdiction. There are no tax
Liens on any asset of IRT or any of its Subsidiaries other than Liens for
current taxes not past due and payable. None of IRT\'s federal income tax
returns has been the subject of an audit by the IRS.   (ii) IRT (A) for all
taxable years commencing with 1997, has been subject to taxation as a REIT
within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has qualified as a REIT for
all such years, (B) has operated since December 31, 2001 to the date of this
representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to
qualify as a REIT for each taxable year ending before or on the later of
December 31, 2002 and the Closing Date, and (C) has not taken or omitted to
take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge
to its status as a REIT and, to IRT\'s knowledge, no such challenge
is pending or threatened. Each Subsidiary of IRT which is a partnership,
joint venture or limited liability company either (1)(x) has been treated
since the later of its formation and the acquisition by IRT of a direct or
indirect interest therein and continues to be treated for federal income tax
purposes either as a partnership or as an entity that is disregarded for
federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or as an association
taxable as a corporation and (y) has not since the later of its formation and
the acquisition by IRT of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned any
assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause IRT to
violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code or (2)(x) met the conditions set forth
in clause (1)(x) and (1)(y) as of December 31, 2001 and (y) as of December
31, 2002, will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a corporation
and will qualify as a taxable REIT Subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the
Code. Each Subsidiary of IRT which is a corporation (aa) has been since its
formation (or, if later, since its acquisition by IRT) a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or (bb) as of December 31, 2002,
will qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code.
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(h) hereto, neither IRT nor any Subsidiary
of IRT holds any    15   asset (xx) the disposition of which would be
subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an
election under IRS Notice 88-19 or Temporary Treas. Reg. ss.1.337(d)-5T or
(yy) which is subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the
Code and the regulations thereunder.   (iii) To the knowledge of IRT, as of
the date hereof, IRT is a "domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning
of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.   (iv) IRT and its Subsidiaries have
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations relating to the withholding of taxes and the payment thereof to
appropriate authorities, including taxes required to have been withheld and
paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee or independent
contractor, and taxes required to be withheld and paid pursuant to Section
1441 or 1442 of the Code or similar provisions under foreign law.   (v)
Neither IRT nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any tax allocation or
sharing agreement, is or has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income tax return (on a consolidated, combined, unitary
or other similar state, local or foreign tax return) or has any tax liability
of any Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law, or as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise.   (vi) During the five-year period ending on the date
hereof, IRT has not been a distributing corporation or a controlled
corporation in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the
Code.   (vii) IRT does not have and has not had a permanent establishment in
any foreign country as defined in any applicable income tax treaty or
convention between the United States and such foreign country.   (viii) IRT
has not taken or agreed to take any action, and does not have any knowledge
of any fact or circumstance, that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger

Effect.   (vi) All properties under development or construction by IRT or

Code and, without limitation, the requirements of ERISA and all tax rules for
which favorable tax treatment is intended, and (B) there are no liabilities
(including unfunded pension or healthcare liabilities) or  
18    obligations with respect to any such IRT Plan, whether accrued,

to make contributions, and for such plan to pay benefits and administrative
costs, incurred in the ordinary course), nor to the knowledge of IRT are any
such liabilities or obligations expected to be incurred.   (iii) Without
limiting the foregoing, each IRT Plan which is intended to be tax-qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue
Service to be so qualified and such determination has not been modified,
revoked or limited, and no circumstances have occurred that would adversely
affect the tax-qualified status of any such plan and each such IRT Plan has
been administered in accordance with its terms and the requirements of the
Code and the regulations and rules of the IRS and the U.S. Department
of Labor except as would not have an IRT Material Adverse Effect. No IRT Plan
is or has ever been subject to Part III of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of IRT or any of its
Subsidiary or any "party in interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA)
or any "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code) with
respect to any IRT Plan, has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA that

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a termination
of service subsequent to the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any employee, officer or
director of IRT or any Subsidiary of IRT. Except for the agreements listed on
Schedule 3.1(k) of the IRT Disclosure Memorandum, there is no agreement or
arrangement with any employee, officer or other service provider under which
IRT or any Subsidiary of IRT has agreed to pay any tax that might be owed
under Section 4999 of the Code with respect to payments to such individuals.
Since July 29, 2002, no extension of credit in the nature of a personal loan
has been made by IRT, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of any

liabilities or business, except as required by a change in GAAP.   (m)

of its affiliates or Subsidiaries occurs which is required to be described in
any amendment of or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement,
such event promptly shall be so described and such amendment or supplement
promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, as required by applicable law
(including applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the New York Stock
Exchange), delivered to the holders of Company Common Stock. The Joint Proxy
Statement shall, on the date first mailed to holders of Company Common Stock
in connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting through and  
25   including the date of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, comply as
to form in all material respects with all applicable rules and regulations
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. All applications, filing and
documents that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is responsible for
filing with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or
the transaction contemplated hereby shall comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable laws and regulations.   (f) Compliance with
Applicable Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all consents, permits,
licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, registrations qualifications,
dispensations concessions, orders, permissions, authorizations and approvals
of all Governmental Entities which are material to the operation of their
respective businesses (the "Company Permits"). The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except
where the failure so to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The respective businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any statute,
judgment, writ, order, decree, edict, pronouncement, law, ordinance
or regulation of any Governmental Entity, except for violations which do not,
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same.   (g) Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.2(g) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, there is no Proceeding pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective assets, which, if
determined adversely to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; nor is
there any judgment, decree, writ, order, edict, pronouncement, injunction,
rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitral authority outstanding
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having, or which would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (h)
Taxes.   (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all
material tax returns required to be filed by it and has paid (or the Company
has paid on its behalf) all taxes required to be paid as shown on such
returns. The most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes payable by the Company
and its Subsidiaries accrued through the date of such financial statements.
Since January 1, 1997, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability for taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the
Code. No event has occurred and no condition exists which presents a risk
that any material tax liability described in the preceding sentence could be
imposed upon the Company and its Subsidiaries. No material deficiencies for
any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed by any taxing jurisdiction
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No requests for waivers of
the time to assess taxes are pending and no tax returns of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have been or are currently being audited by any taxing
jurisdiction. There are no tax Liens on any asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries other than Liens for current taxes not past due and payable.
None of the Company\'s federal income tax returns has been the subject of an
audit by the IRS.   26    (ii) The Company (A) for all taxable years
commencing with 1997, has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the
meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has qualified as a REIT for all such
years, (B) has operated since December 31, 2001 to the date of this
representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to
qualify as a REIT for each taxable year ending before or on the later of
December 31, 2002 and the Closing Date, and (C) has not taken or omitted to
take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge
to its status as a REIT and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no such challenge
is pending or threatened. Each Subsidiary of the Company which is
a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company either (1)(x) has
been treated since the later of its formation and the acquisition by the
Company of a direct or indirect interest therein and continues to be treated
for federal income tax purposes either as a partnership or as an entity that
is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or as
an association taxable as a corporation and (y) has not since the later of
its formation and the acquisition by the Company of a direct or indirect
interest therein, owned any assets (including, without limitation,
securities) that would cause the Company to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the
Code or (2)(x) met the conditions set forth in clause (1)(x) and (1)(y) as of
December 31, 2001 and (y) as of December 31, 2002, will be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a corporation and will qualify as a taxable
REIT Subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code. Each Subsidiary of the
Company which is a corporation (aa) has been since its formation (or, if
later, since its acquisition by the Company) a qualified REIT subsidiary
under Section 856(i) of the Code or (bb) as of December 31, 2002 will qualify
as a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l)of the Code. Except as set
forth in Schedule 3.2(h) hereto, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of
the Company holds any asset (xx) the disposition of which would be subject to
rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under
IRS Notice 88-19 or Temporary Treas. Reg. ss.1.337(d)-5T or (yy) which is
subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder.   (iii) To the knowledge of the Company, as of the
date hereof, the Company is a "domestically-controlled REIT" within the
meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.   (iv) The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations relating to the withholding of taxes and the payment
thereof to appropriate authorities, including taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee or
independent contractor, and taxes required to be withheld and paid pursuant
to Section 1441 or 1442 of the Code or similar provisions under foreign
law.   (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
tax allocation or sharing agreement, is or has been a member of an affiliated
group filing a consolidated federal income tax return (on a consolidated,
combined, unitary or other similar state, local or foreign tax return) or has
any tax liability of any Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, or as a transferee
or successor, by contract or otherwise.   27    (vi) During the five-
year period ending on the date hereof, the Company has not been a
distributing corporation or a controlled corporation in a
transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code.   (vii) The
Company does not have and has not had a permanent establishment in any
foreign country as defined in any applicable income tax treaty or convention
between the United States and such foreign country.   (viii) The Company has
not taken or agreed to take any action, and does not have any knowledge of
any fact or circumstance, that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.   (i) Properties.   (i) Schedule 3.2(i) of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum contains a true and complete list of all of the real
properties in which the Company has an interest (the "Company Properties").
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(i) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum,
either the Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns fee simple title to each
of the Company Properties, except where the failure to own such title would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) Other than as set forth
on Schedule 3.2(i) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, the Company
Properties are not subject to any Liens or Property Restrictions.   (iii)
Valid policies of title insurance (or fully paid and enforceable commitments
therefor) have been issued insuring the Company\'s or its
applicable Subsidiary\'s fee simple title or leasehold estate, as the case
may be, to the Company Properties in amounts which are approximately equal to
the purchase price thereof paid by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary
of the Company therefor, except where the failure to obtain such title
insurance would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (iv) The Company has:   (A) not failed to obtain a certificate,
permit or license from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any
of the Company Properties where such failure would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect and no knowledge of any pending threat
of modification or cancellation of any of the same which would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,   (B) not received any
written notice of any violation of any federal, state or municipal law,
ordinance, order, rule, regulation or requirement affecting any of the
Company Properties issued by any Governmental Entity which would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and   (C) no
knowledge of (1) any structural defects relating to the Company Properties,
(2) Company Properties the building systems of which are not in working
order, (3) physical damage to any Company Property for which there is not  
28   insurance in effect covering the cost of the restoration and the
lost revenue (subject to a commercially reasonable deduction or retention
limit) or zoning or building code violations, except such structural defects,
building systems not in working order, physical damage and violations, which,
singly or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (v) Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company has received any written or published notice to
the effect that (A) any condemnation or involuntary rezoning proceedings are
pending or threatened with respect to any of the Company Properties or (B)
any zoning, building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is
or will be violated by the continued maintenance, operation or use of any
buildings or other improvements on any of the Company Properties or by the
continued maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas, other than such
notices which, singly or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (vi) All properties under
development or construction by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof (the "Company Development Properties") and all properties proposed for
acquisition, development or commencement of construction prior to the
Effective Time by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the
"Company Future Development Properties") are listed in Schedule 3.2(i) of the
Company Disclosure Memorandum. All material executory agreements entered into
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the development or
construction of the Company Development Properties or the Company Future
Development Properties are listed in Schedule 3.2(i) of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum.   (vii) As of the date hereof, the Company has no
capital expenditures in excess of $100,000 for required or planned
improvements, repairs or replacements with respect to any Company Property
other than with respect to Company Development Properties and Company Future
Development Properties.   (j) No Payments to Employees, Officers or
Directors. There are no arrangements, agreements or plans pursuant to which
cash and non-cash payments that will or may become payable to any employee,
officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as a
result of the Merger or a termination of service subsequent to the
consummation of the Merger and the respective amounts of such payments. Since
July 29, 2002, no extension of credit in the nature of a personal loan has
been made by the Company, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of
any Company director or executive officer.   (k) Absence of Certain Changes
or Events. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or set forth on
Schedule 3.2(k) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, since December 31,
2001, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses in the ordinary course (taking into account prior practices,
including the acquisition and disposition of properties and issuance of
securities) and there has not been (i) any circumstance, event, occurrence,
change or effect in regard to the Company that has had a Company Material
Adverse Effect, nor has there been any circumstance, event,
occurrence, change or effect in regards to the Company that with the passage
of time would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) any damage, destruction or loss,   29   whether or not
covered by insurance, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or (iii) any change made prior to the date of
this Agreement in accounting methods (whether for financial accounting or tax

materially affecting its assets, liabilities or business, except as required
by a change in GAAP.   (l) Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company Board
has received the opinion of CIBC World Markets Corp. dated the date of this
Agreement, a true and complete copy of which will be delivered (but not
addressed) to IRT solely for informational purposes after receipt thereof by
the Company, to the effect that as of such date the consideration to be paid

from a financial point of view to the Company.   (m) Brokers; Schedule of
Fees and Expense. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other

the Company Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of
the Company has received a written notice that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of or in default under (nor to the knowledge of
the Company does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or
the giving of notice or both would cause such a violation of or default
under) any Material Contract,   30   to which it is a party or by which
it or any of its properties or assets is bound, nor to the knowledge of the
Company does such a violation or default exist, except to the extent such
violation or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (p) Investment

of the Company are any such liabilities or obligations expected to be

ERISA, for the benefit of any employee or former employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, whether formal or informal and whether legally binding or
not.    ARTICLE IV   COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

or negotiations with, any Person that makes a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal thereto after the date hereof which was not invited,
initiated, solicited or encouraged, directly or indirectly, by the Company or
IRT or any of its Representatives on or after the date hereof, if, and only
to the extent that (i) a majority of the Company Board or the IRT Board, as
applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to furnish such information or enter into
discussions or negotiations could cause the members of the Company Board or
the IRT Board to breach their fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) the
Company or IRT, as applicable, complies with all of its obligations under
this Agreement, (iii) prior to furnishing    34   such information to,

with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, nothing contained in this
Section 4.1(f) shall prohibit the IRT Board from withdrawing, modifying,
amending or qualifying its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger
and recommending an Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders: (A) if, but
only if, IRT: (1) complies fully with this Section 4.1(f) and (2) provides
the Company with at least three business days\' prior written notice of its
intent to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify its recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger, (B) if, in the event that during such three business
days the Company makes a counter proposal to such Acquisition Proposal (any
such counter proposal being referred to in this Agreement as the "Counter
Proposal"), the IRT Board in good faith, taking into account the advice of
its financial advisors, determines (A) that the Counter Proposal is not at
least as favorable to IRT\'s shareholders as the Acquisition Proposal, from a
financial point of view, and (B) the Counter Proposal is not at least as
favorable generally to IRT\'s shareholders (taking into account all financial
and strategic considerations and other relevant factors, including relevant
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and the
conditions, prospects and time required for completion of such proposal), and
(C) IRT shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1 and complied with Section 7.2.   (iv) Any disclosure that the Company
Board or the IRT Board may be compelled to make with respect to the receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal in order to comply with its duties to its
stockholders imposed by applicable law or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act will not constitute a violation of this Section.   (v) Nothing
in this Section shall (i) permit either party to terminate this Agreement

the terms of the Merger and the impact of any proposed transaction on the
transactions contemplated hereby), purchase or acquire or sell, lease,
encumber or otherwise dispose of or agree to acquire or   
35   purchase or agree to sell, lease, encumber or otherwise dispose of,

Schedule 4.2(g) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or termination of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior

shall not exceed an amount equal to 200% of the aggregate net proceeds from
sales of equity securities by the Company subsequent to the date hereof
as permitted by Section 4.1(c) (except for issuances of securities under

shall, nor shall the Company or IRT permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take
any action that would or reasonably would be likely to result in any of its
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being untrue as of

Merger set forth in Article VI hereof not being satisfied.   (i) Advice of
Changes; SEC Filings. Each of the Company and IRT shall confer on a regular
basis with the other, report on operational matters and promptly advise the
other orally, promptly confirmed in writing, of any change or event having,
or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse

thereto received from third persons.   (j) Certain Other Actions.   (i)
From time to time prior to the Closing Date, each of the Company and IRT
promptly shall supplement or amend the Schedules to this
Agreement theretofore prepared by it with respect to any matter which, if
existing as of the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth
therein. It is hereby agreed, however, that no such supplement or amendment
shall be deemed to or constitute a cure of any breach of any representation
or warranty by the applicable party, unless all of the non-breaching parties
expressly agree thereto in writing.   (ii) The Company and IRT shall, and
shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to, duly and timely file all reports,
federal, state and local tax returns and other    36   documents
required to be filed with federal, state, local and other
authorities, subject to extensions permitted by applicable law.   (iii) The
Company and IRT shall not and each of the Company and IRT shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, make, change or rescind any express or deemed election
relative to taxes, accounting methods, conventions or principles which relate
to such party or its Subsidiaries that could materially increase
such party\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' tax liabilities (unless such
election or rescission is required by law or is necessary (1) to preserve
such party\'s status as a REIT, or (2) to qualify or preserve the status of
any Subsidiary as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax
purposes, as a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, or
as a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code, as the case
may be, in which event such party or the applicable Subsidiary shall not fail
to make such election in a timely manner).   (iv) The Company and IRT
promptly shall notify the other party of any Proceeding or audit pending
against or with respect to such party or its Subsidiaries in respect of any

the Company a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Company)
identifying all Persons who, at the time of the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting and IRT Shareholders\' Meeting, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of
IRT as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). IRT shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is identified as a Rule 145
Affiliate in such list to deliver to the Company on or prior to the Effective
Time a written agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, that such
Rule 145 Affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any Company Common Stock issued to such Rule 145 Affiliate pursuant to the
Merger, except pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act or in compliance with paragraph (d) of Rule 145 or as
otherwise permitted by the Securities Act. The Company shall be entitled to
place legends as specified in such written agreements on the certificates
representing any Company Common Stock to be received pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement by such Rule 145 Affiliates who have executed such agreements
and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for
the Company Common Stock issued to such Rule 145 Affiliates, consistent with
the terms of such agreements. The Company shall timely file the reports
required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and it will take such further
action as any Rule 145 Affiliate may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such Rule 145 Affiliate to sell shares
of Company Common Stock received by such Rule 145 Affiliate in the Merger
without registration under the Securities Act pursuant to (i) Rule 145(d)(1)
under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from to time, or (ii)
any successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.    ARTICLE
V   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 5.1 Preparation of Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement.   37    (a) As promptly as practicable after
execution of this Agreement, (i) each of the Company and IRT shall prepare

joint proxy statements/prospectuses and information statements together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement") relating
to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting and
(ii) the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC under the Securities Act
one or more registration statements on Form S-4 (such registration
statements, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Form
S-4"), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included, as one or more
prospectuses, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
the Company Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of the IRT
Common Stock in the Merger. The respective parties will cause the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4, to comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of the Company and IRT shall
furnish all information about itself and its business and operations and all
necessary financial information to the other as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and
the Form S-4. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
IRT will cooperate with the Company, to file and have the Form S-4 declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable (including clearing the Joint
Proxy Statement with the SEC). Each of the Company and IRT agree promptly to
inform the other and to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and each of the parties hereto further agrees to take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 and to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 as amended or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to their respective stockholders
and shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal and state securities laws. Each of the Company and IRT agrees that
the information provided by it for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing
thereof and at the time of the respective meetings of stockholders and
shareholders of the Company and IRT will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Company will advise and
deliver copies (if any) to IRT, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information (regardless of whether such requests relate to IRT or
the Company), and the Company shall promptly notify IRT of (i) the time when
the Form S-4 has become effective, (ii) the filing of any supplement or
amendment thereto, (iii) the issuance of any stop order, and (iv) the
suspension of the qualification and registration of the Company Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger.   (b) Each of the Company and IRT
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to timely mail the Joint Proxy
Statement contained in the Form S-4 to its respective stockholders or
shareholders. IRT also shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Alston and Bird LLP or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to
have delivered an opinion, which opinion shall be filed with the SEC as an
exhibit to the Form S-4, as to the federal income tax matters described in
Sections 6.2(f) and 6.3(e) and such other federal income tax matters as are
required to be addressed in the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement
under    38   the applicable rules of the SEC. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Greenberg Traurig, P.A. or other
counsel reasonably satisfactory to IRT to have delivered an opinion, which
opinion shall be filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the Form S-4, as to the
federal income tax matters described in Sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(f) and such
other federal income tax matters as are required to be addressed in the Form
S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement under the applicable rules of the SEC. Such
opinions shall contain customary exceptions, assumptions and qualifications
and be based upon customary representations.   (c) (i) IRT will duly call
and give notice of and, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (but in no event sooner than 20 business days following the date
the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed to the shareholders of IRT), convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "IRT Shareholders\' Meeting") for the
purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. IRT shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its shareholders approval of the IRT Shareholder
Approval and include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. Except
pursuant to Section 4.1(f)(iii) or subsection (ii) below, the IRT Board shall
not withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, its approval of this Agreement or
the Merger or its recommendation that the IRT shareholders vote in favor of
the IRT Shareholder Approval.   (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the IRT Board may, on the
Withdrawal Date, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify its approval of this Agreement or the Merger or
its recommendation that the IRT shareholders vote in favor of the IRT
Shareholder Approval if, either (A) the 30-Day Average Trading Price is less
than $12.06, or (B) the 3-Day Average Trading Price is less than $11.00. For
the purpose of this subsection, the "30-Day Average Trading Price" shall mean
the weighted average trading price per share of the Company Common Stock as
quoted on the New York Stock Exchange for all transactions during the thirty
(30) trading days ending on (and inclusive of) the fourth business
day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the IRT Shareholders\'
Meeting (such fourth day, the "Withdrawal Date"). For the purpose of this
subsection, the "3-Day Average Trading Price" shall mean the weighted average
trading price per share of the Company Common Stock as quoted on the New York
Stock Exchange for all transactions during the three (3) trading days ending
on (and inclusive of) the Withdrawal Date.   (iii) If the IRT Board shall
take any action set forth in subsection (ii) above, IRT shall provide written
notice thereof to the Company not later than 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the
next day. Following the receipt by the Company of such notice, the Company
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to 7.1(h)(1) or otherwise request that
IRT adjourn or postpone the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting for up to an
additional thirty (30) days in order to permit the Company to prepare, file
and disseminate any amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement
reflecting such withdrawal, modification, amendment or qualification, and IRT
shall cooperate in the preparation, filing and dissemination of such material
in accordance with Section 5.1 hereof.   (d) The Company will duly call and
give notice of and, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (but in no event sooner than 20 business days following the   
39   date the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed to the stockholders of the
Company), convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders\' Meeting") for the purpose of approving (i) this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including but not
limited to the authorization and issuance of the Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1, (ii) the authorization and issuance of up to
6,911,000 shares of Company Common Stock in a private placement (the "Private
Placement") to occur immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) the
election of the person appointed to serve as a director pursuant to Section
5.16 of this Agreement (collectively, the "Company Stockholder Approvals").
The Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders approval of the Company Stockholder Approvals and include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. The Company Board shall not
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to IRT, the approval of the Company Board of this
Agreement, the Merger or the Private Placement or the recommendation of the
Company Board to Company Stockholders that they vote in favor of the Company
Stockholder Approvals.   (e) IRT and the Company shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to convene their respective shareholder and
stockholder meetings on the same day, which day, subject to the provisions of
Sections 5.1(c) and 5.1(d), shall be a day not later than 30 business days
after the date the Joint Proxy Statement is mailed.   (f) If on the date
for the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting and the Company Stockholders\' Meeting
established pursuant to Section 5.1(e) of this Agreement, either IRT or the
Company has not received duly executed proxies for a sufficient number of
votes to approve the Merger, then both parties shall recommend the
adjournment or postponement of their respective shareholders and stockholders
meetings until one or more dates not later than ten business days, or the
earliest practicable date if notice of the adjourned meeting is required to
be given under the Company\'s or IRT\'s charters or bylaws or under the MGCL
or the GBCC, respectively, after the originally scheduled date of the
meetings.   SECTION 5.2 Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, the
Company and IRT each shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other agents and
representatives of the other, access, during normal business hours during the
period from the date hereof until the Effective Time, to all of its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such
period, the Company and IRT each shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Trust Indenture Act and (b) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party
reasonably may request. The parties shall hold all such information in strict
confidence pursuant to the confidentiality provisions of that certain letter
agreement between the Company and IRT dated June 9, 2001 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). In the event of termination of this
Agreement for any reason, each party promptly shall return all such
information obtained from any other party, and any copies made of (and
destroy other extrapolations from or work product or analyses based in whole
or in part on) such documents, to such other party. The provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement currently in effect on the date hereof are hereby
ratified and affirmed and will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms and survive any termination of this
Agreement.   40    SECTION 5.3 Consents and Approvals. Each of the
Company and IRT shall take all reasonable actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on it with respect
to the Merger (including furnishing all information in connection with
approvals of or filings with any Governmental Entity) and shall cooperate
with and furnish information to each other in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon it or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger. Each of the Company and IRT shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and shall
cooperate with the other in obtaining) each consent, authorization, order or
approval of, and each exemption by, each Governmental Entity and other
person or entity, required to be obtained or made by the parties hereto or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated hereby or thereby where
the failure to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect or an IRT Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.   SECTION 5.4 Validity of Shares. All shares of Company Common
Stock issued in the Merger, when so issued in accordance with Article II,
shall be duly and validly authorized, fully paid and non-assessable.  
SECTION 5.5 Employee Benefit Plans and Employment Matters.   (a) After the
Effective Time, all employees of IRT who are employed by the Company shall be
eligible to participate in the same manner as other similarly situated
employees of the Company in any "employee benefit plan," as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA, sponsored or maintained by the Company after
the Effective Time or, if the Company determines it is not practicable for
such employees to do so immediately after the Effective Time, then such
employees shall continue to be eligible to participate in an employee benefit
plan of IRT which is continued by the Company until such time as the Company
determines it is practicable to include them in its employee benefit plans
for similarly situated employees of the Company as contemplated above. With
respect to each such employee benefit plan, service with IRT or any of its
Subsidiaries (as applicable) and the predecessor of any of them (to the
extent past service has been so recognized by IRT as of the Effective Time)
shall be included for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting (if applicable) and determination of the level of entitlement to
benefits, under such employee benefit plan. The Company shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive, to the extent permitted by the related plans,
third-party providers and carriers, all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to all employees of IRT who are employed by
the Company under any welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan
maintained for such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) provide each such employee of IRT who is employed by the Company with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after
the Effective Time.   (b) Subject to continuation as provided in clause (a)
above, the "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, of
IRT shall be terminated and discontinued    41   effective as of the
Effective Time. In addition, the IRT Property Company 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and the IRT Property Company Deferred Compensation Plan for
Outside Directors shall be terminated and discontinued, and all
account balances shall be paid out in a lump sum to all participants,
effective as of the Effective Time.   (c) The Board of Directors of IRT or
a committee of "Non-Employee Directors" thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution in
advance of the Effective Time providing that the disposition by the officers
and directors of IRT Common Stock, IRT Options or other equity securities of
IRT pursuant to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act. The Board of Directors of the Company or a committee
of Non-Employee Directors thereof shall adopt a resolution in advance of the
Effective Time providing that the receipt by IRT Insiders (as defined below)
of Company Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company pursuant to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the
extent such equity securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, as
defined below) is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Section, the term "IRT Insiders"
means those officers and directors of IRT who will become subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as insiders of
the Company in conjunction with the Merger, and the term "Section 16
Information" means information provided by IRT that is accurate in all
respects regarding IRT Insiders and the number of shares of Company Common
Stock or other Company equity securities to be acquired by each such
IRT Insider in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   SECTION 5.6 Expenses. Except as hereafter provided in
Section 7.2, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement (including all Exhibits
hereto and instruments and agreements prepared and delivered in connection
herewith), the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated or abandoned; provided, however, that if the IRT
Board withdraws, modifies, amends or qualifies its approval or recommendation
of the Merger or this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii) and this
Agreement is not terminated pursuant to either Section 7.1(g)(ii) or
7.1(h)(1), then the Company shall pay the costs and expenses of IRT in
connection with the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting incurred after the date
of such withdrawal, modification, amendment or qualification.   SECTION 5.7
Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or its successors
(the "Indemnifying Parties") shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or at any time prior to the date hereof has been or who
prior to the Effective Time becomes, an officer, director, employee or agent
of IRT or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") from and
against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities, judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the
approval of the Indemnifying Party (which approval shall not unreasonably be
withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, case
or investigation ("Action") based or arising, in whole or in part, out of or
in connection with the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of IRT or any of its Subsidiaries or arising as a result of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted
or claimed    42   prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each
case to the fullest extent IRT would be permitted under the GBCC and its
charter and bylaws to indemnify its own directors, officers, employees and
agents, as the case may be including provisions relating to the advancement
of expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under the GBCC and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon receipt of any undertaking required by the GBCC and
its charter and bylaws. Any Indemnified Party electing to claim
indemnification under this Section, upon learning of any Action, shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such election (but the failure so
to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have under this Section, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices it or if it otherwise forfeits substantive rights and
defenses as a result of such failure), and shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party the undertaking required by the GBCC and its charter and
bylaws. If any such Action is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties
and such Indemnified Parties notify the Indemnifying Parties of its
commencement, the Indemnifying Parties will be entitled to participate in
and, to the extent that they elect by delivering written notice to such
Indemnified Parties promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of
the Action from the Indemnified Parties, to assume the defense of the action
and after notice from the Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnified Parties of
their election to assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties will not be
liable to the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses except as
provided below. If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to settle such action without the
consent of the Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
Parties shall be required to obtain such consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) if the settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing
on the part of the Indemnified Parties or any decree or restriction on the
Indemnified Parties; provided further, however, that no Indemnifying Parties,
in the defense of any such action shall, except with the consent of the
Indemnified Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to such Indemnified Parties of a release from all liability
with respect to such action. The Indemnified Parties will have the right to
employ their own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other
charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Parties
unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Parties has been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (ii) the Indemnified
Parties have reasonably concluded (based on written advise of counsel to the
Indemnified Parties) that there may be legal defenses available to them that
are different from or in addition to and inconsistent with those available to
the Indemnifying Parties, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists
(based on written advice of counsel to the Indemnified Parties) between the
Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties (in which case the
Indemnifying Parties will not have the right to direct the defense of such
action on behalf of the Indemnified Parties) or (iv) the Indemnifying Parties
have not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within
a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action
from the Indemnified Parties, in each of which cases the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Parties and shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly be
paid by each Indemnifying Party as they become due and payable in advance of
the final disposition of the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
to the fullest extent and in the manner permitted by law; provided, however,
that in no event shall any contingent fee arrangement be considered
reasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not
be    43   obligated to advance any expenses or costs prior to receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of each Indemnified Party to repay any
expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified against such expense. It is
understood that the Indemnifying Parties shall not, in connection with any
proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the
reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate
firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such
Indemnified Parties, unless (a) the employment of more than one counsel has
been expressly authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (b) any of
the Indemnified Parties has reasonably concluded (based on written advice of
counsel to the Indemnified Parties) that there may be legal defenses
available to them that are different from or in addition to and inconsistent
with those available to the other Indemnified Parties or (c) a conflict or
potential conflict exists (based on written advice of counsel to
the Indemnified Parties) between any of the Indemnified Parties and the
other Indemnified Parties, in each case of which the Indemnifying Parties
shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional
counsel or counsels. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification
is prohibited by applicable law. In the event of a final and non-appealable
determination by a court that any payment of expenses is prohibited by
applicable law, the Indemnified Parties shall promptly refund to the
Indemnifying Parties the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced
pursuant hereto.   (b) For not less than six years after the Effective Time,
the Company shall maintain directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policies with Royal Sun Alliance (or its successors) of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous than the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage
provided by IRT\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance on the date
hereof, or if such coverage is unavailable on commercially reasonable terms,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much
coverage as is reasonably available, provided, the indemnified parties shall
each provide the Company with claim letters substantially in the form of
Exhibit B.   (c) This section is intended for the irrevocable benefit of,
and to grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their
respective successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Company. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section and the
Company acknowledges and agrees that each Indemnified Party would suffer
irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of
such covenants and such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to injunctive

in this Section.   (d) If the Company or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the

obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each director and officer covered hereby.  
44    SECTION 5.8 Additional Agreements; Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms

by this Agreement at the earliest practicable time, including, without
limitation, cooperating fully with the other party, providing information and
making all necessary filings in connection with, among other things, any
requisite approval of any Governmental Entity and the issuance of shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of either of the Company or IRT, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement promptly shall take all such necessary action.

as the case may be, shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement or announcement prior to such consultation.   SECTION 5.11
Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall provide prompt notice to
IRT, and IRT shall provide prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty made by them
and contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any material failure of the
Company or IRT, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder, (iii) any notice of, or other communication relating to, a
default (or an event which with notice, lapse of time, or both, would become
a default) received by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time, under any agreement or instrument to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any assets or
properties of it or its Subsidiaries are subject, which default if
conclusively established adversely to IRT or the Company would reasonably be
expected to result in an IRT Material Adverse Effect or Company Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable, (iv) any notice or other communication from
any person or entity alleging that the consent of such person or entity is or
may be required in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (v) any Company Material Adverse Effect or IRT Material
Adverse Effect shall have occurred or is reasonably likely to occur;
provided, however that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.11 shall not cure any breach or noncompliance    45   under this
Agreement or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving any such notice.   SECTION 5.12 New York Stock Exchange

the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to

other regarding the declaration and payment of quarterly dividends with

shall be paid or made on the same date. Subject to increases as set forth
below, quarterly dividends with respect to the IRT Common Stock shall not
exceed $0.235 per share, appropriately adjusted for partial or greater
periods from the prior record date. The foregoing limitations on dividends
shall not apply, however, to a Final IRT Dividend payable by IRT.   (b) On
the first regular dividend record date following the Effective Time, the
Company Board shall declare a cash dividend of no less than $0.27 per

knowingly take any action that could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b) IRT does not know of

the facts relevant to the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, in a form that is
substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines,

46   additions) thereto, to enable such firms to deliver the opinions
contemplated by Sections 6.2(f) and 6.3(f).   (c) The Company does not know
of any reason why it will not be able to deliver to Alston and Bird LLP and
Greenberg Traurig, P.A., at the time the Form S-4 or any amendment thereto is
filed with the SEC and on or about the Closing Date, certificates relating to
the facts relevant to the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization

be true and correct as of such date and time, and (ii) by their terms are
qualified by materiality or any analogous limitation on scope which, for
purposes of this Section 6.3 (a), shall be true and correct in all respects
and except that no representation or warranty shall fail to be true and
correct as a result of the incurrence or payment by IRT of expenses incurred

consents and approvals would not, in the reasonable opinion of the Company,

ARTICLE VII   TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT   SECTION 7.1 Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the holders of Company Common Stock or by the holders of IRT Common
Stock:   (a) by the mutual written consent duly authorized by the IRT Board
and the Company Board;   (b) by (i) IRT if there shall have occurred a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Company set forth in this Agreement which would entitle IRT to not
consummate the Merger under Article VI, or a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of any stockholder of the Company
set forth in a Company Voting Agreement, and, in each case, which has not
been or cannot be permanently cured within 30 days (but no later than 10 days
following a vote at the later to occur of the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting or

IRT set forth in this Agreement which would entitle the Company to not
consummate the Merger under Article VI, or a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of any shareholder of IRT set

or the Company Stockholders\' Meeting) next following receipt by IRT of
notice of such breach;   (c) by either IRT or the Company if any permanent
injunction or other order of a court, or any rule, decree, statute, law,
executive order or regulation shall be enacted or entered by any Governmental
Entity or other competent authority, preventing consummation of the Merger
shall have been issued; provided, however, this right shall not be available
to any party whose failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement has

either IRT or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated at or
prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on March 31, 2003; provided, however, this
right shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any
provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed
to, the Merger not being consummated by such date;   (e) by either IRT or
the Company (unless the Company is in breach in any material respect of its
obligations under Section 5.1) if, upon a vote at a duly held Company   
51   Stockholders\' Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the Company
Stockholder Approvals shall not have been obtained as contemplated by Section

Proposal (except as expressly permitted by Section 5.1(c)(ii)), or (ii) if
the Board of Directors of IRT shall have withdrawn, modified, amended or
qualified its approval or recommendation of either the Merger or this
Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii) and within 48 hours of such
withdrawal, modification, amendment or qualification, the Company has not
advised IRT that it has elected to require IRT to proceed with or otherwise
adjourn the IRT Shareholders\' Meeting pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(iii), or
(iii) in order to enter into a binding written agreement with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal, provided that, in each case, IRT shall have complied
with the terms of Section 4.1(f) and, simultaneously with terminating
pursuant to this Section, has paid to the Company the Break-Up Fee (as
defined herein) as provided by Section 7.2; and   (h) by the Company, if
(i) the Board of Directors of IRT shall have failed to recommend or
withdrawn, modified, amended or qualified, or proposed publicly not to
recommend or to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any manner adverse to
the Company its approval or recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement
or approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal, or if the Board of
Directors of IRT or any committee thereof shall have resolved to do any of
the foregoing, or (ii) following the announcement or receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, IRT shall have failed to call the IRT Shareholders\'
Meeting in accordance with Section 5.1(a) or failed to prepare and mail to
its shareholders the Joint Proxy Statement in accordance with Section 5.1(a)
or 5.1(b).   SECTION 7.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i), 7.1(g)(iii) or 7.1(h) (other than a
termination by the Company solely as a result of the withdrawal,
modification, amendment or qualification of the approval or recommendation by
the IRT Board of this Agreement or the Merger pursuant to Section
5.1(c)(ii)), then IRT theretofore or thereupon shall pay to the Company a fee
equal to the Break-Up Fee. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(ii), then the non-terminating party shall
pay to the other (provided that the non-terminating party was not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at the time of such
termination) an amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses. In addition, if this
Agreement shall be terminated by IRT pursuant to Sections 7.1(c), 7.1(d) (if
primarily resulting from any action or inaction of IRT or any of its
Subsidiaries), 7.1(f) or 7.1(g)(ii) or by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(f) or Section 7.1(h) (solely as a result of the withdrawal, modification,
amendment or qualification of the approval or recommendation by the IRT Board
of this Agreement or the Merger pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii)) and prior to
the time of such termination an Acquisition Proposal has been received by
IRT, and either prior to the termination of this Agreement or   
52   within twelve months thereafter, IRT enters into any written agreement
to consummate a transaction or series of transactions which, had such
agreement been proposed or negotiated during the term of this Agreement,
would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 4.1(f)
(each, an "Acquisition Proposal Agreement"), which is subsequently
consummated (whether or not any Acquisition Proposal Agreement relates to the
same Acquisition Proposal which had been received prior to the termination of
this Agreement, unless at least 60 days prior to the execution of the
Acquisition Proposal Agreement IRT shall have made a public announcement that
the party to the initial Acquisition Proposal has formally withdrawn its
offer and that party has not made an additional Acquisition Proposal prior to
the execution of the Acquisition Proposal Agreement), then IRT shall pay a
fee equal to the Break-Up Fee to the Company.   The payment of the Break-Up
Fee to the Company or the Break-Up Expenses to the Company or IRT, as the
case may be, shall be the sole compensation for the loss suffered by the
party receiving such payment as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated (including, without limitation, opportunity costs and, in the
case of the Break-up Fee, out-of-pocket costs and expenses) and to avoid the
difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances. The Break-Up Fee
shall be paid by IRT to the Company and the Break-up Expenses shall be paid
by the Company to IRT or IRT to the Company, as applicable, in immediately
available funds within two business days after the date the event giving rise
to the obligation to make such payment occurred (except as otherwise provided
in Section 7.1(g)). The Company and IRT acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are integral parts of this
Agreement; accordingly, if IRT fails to promptly pay the Break-Up Fee or if
the Company or IRT fails to promptly pay the Break-Up Expenses due pursuant
to this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain payment, the Company or IRT
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company or IRT for
any amounts owed pursuant to this Section 7.2, the Company or IRT, as
applicable, shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount owed at the rate on six-month U.S.
Treasury obligations in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made plus 300 basis points.   As used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Fee"
shall be an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the "Base Amount"), provided,
however, that the maximum amount that the Company can receive in its taxable
year in which occurs the event giving rise to liability for the Break-Up Fee
shall be the maximum amount that the Company can receive in that year without
failing the REIT Income Requirements (as defined below), determined as if the
receipt of that amount does not constitute Qualifying Income (as defined
below), as determined by the independent accountants of the Company. If the
Company initially is unable to receive the full Base Amount, IRT shall place
the unpaid portion of the Base Amount in escrow. The amount in escrow shall
be distributed in full to the Company at any time the Company receives a
letter from outside counsel which states that the Company has received a
private letter ruling from the IRS which holds that its receipt of a payment
of the Base Amount constitutes Qualifying Income or is excludible from gross
income for purposes of the REIT Income Requirements. The amount in escrow
shall be distributed in full or in part to the Company at any time the
Company receives a letter from outside counsel which states that the Company
has received a private letter ruling from the IRS which holds that its
receipt of a payment of part or all of the Base Amount from the escrow will
not be includible in income by the Company prior to its actual receipt by the
Company, in which case the amount   53   distributable to the Company in
any taxable year shall be the amount set forth in a letter from the
Company\'s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that the
Company can receive at that time without causing the Company to fail the REIT
Income Requirements. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence, there is no limitation on the number of
distributions that can be made from the escrow prior to the third anniversary
of the date of this Agreement. The obligation of the IRT to pay any unpaid
portion of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate three years from the date of this
Agreement. Income is "Qualifying Income" if it is described in
any subparagraph of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code and in any subparagraph of
Section 856(c)(3) of the Code. The "REIT Income Requirements" are the
requirements imposed by Section 856(c)(2) and (3) on the income that an
entity can receive and qualify as a REIT for purposes of the Code.   As
used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Expenses" shall be an amount equal to the
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company or IRT, as the case may
be (the "Recipient") in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all
attorneys\', accountants\' and investment bankers\' fees and expenses),
provided, however, that the maximum amount that the Recipient can receive in
its taxable year in which occurs the event giving rise to liability for the
Break-Up Expenses shall be the maximum amount that the Recipient can receive
in that year without failing the REIT Income Requirements, determined as if
the receipt of that amount does not constitute Qualifying Income, as
determined by the independent accountants of the Recipient. If the Recipient
initially is unable to receive the full amount of the Break-Up Expenses, the
Company or IRT, as the case may be (the "Payor"), shall place the unpaid
portion of the Break-Up Expenses in escrow. The amount in escrow shall be
distributed in full to the Recipient at any time the Recipient receives a
letter from outside counsel which states that the Recipient has received a
private letter ruling from the IRS which holds that its receipt of a payment
of the Break-Up Expenses constitutes Qualifying Income or is excludible from
gross income for purposes of the REIT Income Requirements. The amount
in escrow shall be distributed in full or in part to the Recipient at any
time the Recipient receives a letter from outside counsel which states that
the Recipient has received a private letter ruling from the IRS which holds
that its receipt of a payment of part or all of the Break-Up Expenses from
the escrow will not be includible in income by the Recipient prior to its
actual receipt by the Recipient, in which case the amount distributable to
the Recipient in any taxable year shall be the amount set forth in a letter
from the Recipient\'s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount
that the Recipient can receive at that time without causing the Recipient to
fail the REIT Income Requirements. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no limitation on
the number of distributions that can be made from the escrow prior to the
third anniversary of the date of this Agreement. The obligation of any Payor
to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Expenses shall terminate three
years from the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
maximum amount of the Break-Up Expenses that either party shall be obligated
to reimburse the other party shall not exceed $1.5 million.   SECTION 7.3

taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time

no amendment shall be made which pursuant to applicable law requires
further approval by such holders without obtaining such further
approval.    54   This Agreement may not be amended except by an
