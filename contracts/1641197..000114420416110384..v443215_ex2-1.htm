(in each case, solely in their capacity as such) (each such Person, excluding any Selling Stockholders, a &ldquo;<U>Parent Indemnified

of any agreement or covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Closing, (c)

Parent and the Sellers Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders to promptly surrender
to Parent from the Escrow Account a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, valued at a per share price of $10.00 (irrespective
of the then market value of the Parent Common Stock), equal to the value of such Losses. The total aggregate amount of Escrow
Shares in the Escrow Account as of the Closing Date (such shares, together, the &ldquo;<U>Total Escrow Shares</U>&rdquo;) shall

shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Indemnifying Holders fifty percent

of Total Escrow Shares equal in value to the amount of Losses asserted with respect to any Parent Indemnification Claim in accordance

of the Survival Period, Parent and Sellers Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Exchange Agent for
