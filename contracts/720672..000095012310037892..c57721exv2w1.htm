ARTICLE 2 
 The Merger 

   

 Section 2.01 _The Merger_. 

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place in St. Louis, Missouri at the offices of Bryan Cave LLP, 211 North Broadway, Suite 3600, St. Louis, Missouri 63102 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may, at its option, if the Closing would otherwise occur within ten (10) days before the last Business Day of a calendar month, defer the Closing to the final Business Day of such month; and the Parties will make all closing deliveries contemplated herein into escrow and will each deliver to the other a certificate signed by a duly authorized executive officer of such Party confirming on behalf of each such Party and its Affiliates that all conditions precedent to the obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been satisfied or waived and that the Parties will have irrevocably committed to completing the transaction on the final Business Day of such calendar month.

  

 (c) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as permitted by Delaware Law as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall be specified in the certificate of merger).

    ##### 

  

    

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the properties, rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

   

ARTICLE 3 
 Conversion of the Common Stock; Exchange of Certificates 

   

 Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Subsidiary, Parent or any holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company, Merger Subsidiary or Parent, the following shall occur: 

 

 (a) Each share of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Share", and together, the "Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Parent or by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and in each case not held on behalf of Third Parties (each an "Excluded Company Share", and collectively, "Excluded Company Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive and shall become exchangeable for 0.1364 (such ratio, the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $0.15 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration").

   

 At the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of such Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) and (ii) each uncertificated Company Share (an "Uncertificated Company Share") registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (other than Excluded Company Shares), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 3.02(g) cash in lieu of fractional shares otherwise receivable pursuant to this Section 3.01(a) and any distributions or dividends pursuant to Section 3.02(f), in each case without interest. 

 

 (b) Each Company Share that is owned by Parent or by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and, in each case, not held on behalf of Third Parties, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

  

 (c) In the event the holders of the Company Exchangeable Shares approve the Exchangeable Share Amendment, (i) the share of Company Special Voting Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the one fully paid and nonasseable share of Parent Special Voting Preferred Stock (the "Parent Preferred Stock Consideration"), which Parent Special Voting Preferred Stock shall have terms that are identical to the Company Special Voting Preferred Stock (except that the issuer thereof shall be Parent rather than the Company and the voting rights described therein shall apply to Parent Common Stock rather than to Company Common Stock); and (ii) as of the Effective Time, such share of Company Special Voting Preferred Stock shall no longer be

    ##### 

  

     

outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and the certificate representing such Company Special Voting Preferred
Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Parent
Preferred Stock Consideration. 

  

 (d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted, and which share shall constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation.

   

 Section 3.02 _Surrender and Payment_. 

 

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint (subject to the Companys prior approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) a commercial bank or trust company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates or Uncertificated Company Shares for the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Section through the Exchange Agent, securities representing shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and payable pursuant to Section 3.01 in exchange for outstanding Company Shares and, after the Effective Time, if applicable, any cash and dividends or other distribution with respect to the Parent Common Stock to be issued or to be paid pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.01(a) (together, the "Exchange Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Company Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

 (b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon delivery of the Ownership Evidence, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Shares represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share and any cash and dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to be issued or to be paid pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.01(a). Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Company Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Company Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

    ##### 

  

    

 (d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Company Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and cash, dividends or other distributions to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

  

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.02(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.01 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any cash, dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

 (f) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of such Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered or undelivered Ownership Evidence until such Ownership Evidence is provided to the Exchange Agent or Parent in accordance with this Article 3. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender or delivery, as applicable, of any such Ownership Evidence to the Exchange Agent or Parent in accordance with this Article 3, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the Ownership Evidence representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender or delivery, as the case may be, the dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of issuance of such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not previously paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time on the Closing Date but with a payment date subsequent to surrender or delivery and not previously paid.

  

 (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in respect of any Company Shares (including upon exchange of any Company Exchangeable Shares) and any holder of Company Shares (or Company Exchangeable Shares) entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 3.02(g) shall be entitled to receive in lieu thereof an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a

    ##### 

  

     

share) by the average closing sale prices for a share of Parent Common Stock
on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape
(as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition), or, if not
reported thereby, as reported by any other authoritative source) for each of
the ten consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading
day prior to the Closing Date (not counting the Closing Date). 

  

 (h) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal, state, provincial, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

 (i) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in the form customarily required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, and the submission of such other documentation as Parent customarily requires for the replacement of lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, the Exchange Agent (or Parent pursuant to Section 3.02(e)) will deliver a certificate evidencing the ownership of such number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or any cash, dividends and other distributions in respect thereof issuable and/or payable in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

  

 (j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Company Shares surrendered for exchange by an "affiliate" of the Company that will, after the Effective Time, be an "affiliate" of Parent, in each case as determined pursuant to Section 9.06, shall not be exchanged until Parent has received a written agreement from such Person as provided in Exhibit A.

   

 Section 3.03 _Appraisal Rights._ In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Shares in connection with the Merger. 

  

 Section 3.04 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution._ In the event that prior to the Effective Time there is a change in the number of Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 3.05 _Company Stock Options and Other Equity Awards; Warrants; Company Exchangeable Shares_. 

   ##### 

  

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Shares (a "Company Stock Option") under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an option to acquire (subject to the same continued vesting, if applicable) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Company Share of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any vesting requirements) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be deemed converted to the right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Company Shares or benefits measured by the value of Company Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Company Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company other than Company Stock Options and rights granted under Company Restricted Stock Units (the "Company Awards"), shall be deemed to be converted into the right to acquire or receive benefits measured by the value of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. If any such Company Award provided for an exercise price, such exercise price shall be adjusted as provided in Section 3.05(a) with respect to Company Stock Options, and each such right shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to such right under the relevant employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Award shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any vesting requirements) as were applicable under such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

    ##### 

  

    

 (d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions, and the Company shall otherwise take all actions, as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 3.05(a), (b) and (c).

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, the Warrant shall be converted into the right to purchase and receive (in lieu of the shares of Company Common Stock purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented by the Warrant immediately prior to Closing) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to the Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Company Share of such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

  

 (f) In the event the holders of the Company Exchangeable Shares approve the Exchangeable Share Amendment, (i) at and following the Effective Time, each of the Company Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (in lieu of the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exchange therefor immediately prior to Closing) become exchangeable for the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to Section 3.02(g) hereof with respect to the issuance of fractional shares upon conversion thereof; (ii) at or before the Effective Time, Parent shall execute and deliver the Voting and Support Supplement wherein the Parent agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Voting and Support Agreements, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and to Parent, and, to the satisfaction of the Trustee, preserving and not impairing in any material respect, any of the rights, duties, powers and authorities of the Trustee or the holders of Company Exchangeable Shares under the Voting and Support Agreements and the parties shall effect any other amendments of the Exchangeable Share Documents necessary to give effect to the provisions hereof; and (iii) at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have authorized the Parent Special Voting Preferred Stock and shall deliver to the Trustee a new certificate evidencing the Parent Special Voting Preferred Stock, to the extent required under the Voting and Support Supplement. In the event the holders of the Company Exchangeable Shares do not approve the Exchangeable Share Amendment at a meeting held or by written consent sought for such purpose, the Company shall take action necessary to (a) cause Canadian Sub to exercise its right to redeem, at the Effective Time, all of the outstanding Company Exchangeable Shares or (b) acquire or cause CallRightCo to acquire at the Effective Time all of the outstanding Company Exchangeable Shares.

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Stock Units, the Warrants and the Company Exchangeable Shares and make any amendments to the terms of such equity or compensation plans or arrangements, the Warrants or the plans or arrangements relating to the Company Exchangeable Shares that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.03 and to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock Units until such necessary consents are obtained. The Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the Surviving Corporation will not be bound at the Effective Time by any options, or other rights, awards or arrangements under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement or other third party agreements of

    ##### 

  

     

the Company that would entitle any Person after the Effective Time to
beneficially own any Company Shares or to receive any payments in respect
thereof. 

  

 (h) If registration of any interest in Parents 2001 Incentive Stock Plan (or other applicable equity incentive plan) or the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder is required under the 1933 Act, Parent shall file with the SEC within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such interests or Parent Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the relevant stock plans remain in effect and such registration of interests therein or the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be required.

  

 (i) Parent shall file with the SEC within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to the resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exchange of Company Exchangeable Shares following Closing and naming such selling shareholders in such Form S-3 who have provided information reasonably requested by Parent, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such resale registration continues to be required under the Voting and Support Agreements and the Voting and Support Supplement.

ARTICLE 5

 Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any other section to the extent such statements are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that: 

  

 Section 5.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is 

   ##### 

  

  

duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing

jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material

certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and the Company Special Voting Preferred, voting together as a single class, is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval").

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders (and in no event after the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders), the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may, subject to compliance with Section 7.03(c), (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the Companys compliance with Section 7.03(a) has made after the date of this Agreement a Superior Proposal or an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes (after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided, promptly after its execution, for informational purposes only to Parent), it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision; provided that all such information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party) and (iii) following receipt of a Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement or a development or a change in circumstances occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known by the Companys board of directors as of the date of this Agreement (such material

development or change in circumstance, an "Intervening Event"), make an
Adverse Recommendation Change, but in each case referred to in the foregoing
clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering advice from
outside legal counsel to the Company, that in light of such Superior Proposal
or Intervening Event, such action is required in order for the Board to
comply with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Nothing contained
herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from complying
with requirements of Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this Section 7.03; provided, that such
requirement will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such requirement would otherwise have under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 7.03(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action.

The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all significant correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that for purposes of this definition all references to "15% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%") on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal would result in a transaction (i) that if consummated, is more favorable to Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger or, if applicable, any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, taking into account any governmental and other approval requirements, (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the person making the proposal, any approval requirements and all other financial, legal and other aspects of such proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company.

 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with

 (c) It is understood that Parents expressed intention to extend offers of continued employment as set forth in this Section 8.05 shall not constitute any commitment, contract or understanding (expressed or implied) of any obligation on the part of Parent or its Subsidiaries to a post Closing employment relationship of any fixed term or duration or upon any terms or conditions other than the provisions of Sections 8.05(a) and (b); _provided that_ , from the Closing Date through the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Affected Employees who remain employed with Parent or its Subsidiaries compensation and benefits at a level consistent with Section 8.05(a) above.

      ##### 

  

    

Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation of any of their respective
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein or to consent to any agreement to take any of the foregoing actions)
or to agree to any material changes (including through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own
or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer,
receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to

If any Governmental Authority, including any antitrust authority, seeks amendments to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or commitments to be undertaken by any Party as a condition to refraining from seeking to block such transactions, allowing the applicable waiting period to expire or releasing such Governmental Authoritys consent with respect to such transactions, the Parties shall commence and conduct good faith negotiations with each other for no less than fifteen (15) days and use their reasonable best efforts to agree upon amendments to this Agreement which are necessary in order to resolve the issues raised by such Governmental Authority and permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Party shall be required to agree to any material divestiture, sale, license or Lien of any properties, assets or businesses by any Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of the foregoing to conduct their respective businesses or to own or exercise control of their respective assets and properties.

 "Payment Event" means the termination of this Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 11.01(d)(i), (y) Section 11.01(b)(i) (if a vote of the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been held prior to such termination) or (z) Section 11.01(c)(i) but only if, (A) in the case of clause (y), both (1) after the date hereof and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, or the date of termination, as the case may be, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made, and (2) within 12 months following the date of such termination: (I) the Company merges with or into, or is acquired, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal; (II) such Person, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (III) such Person, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the outstanding Company Shares (or in any of clauses (I) through (III) the Company shall have entered into any contract or agreement providing for such action, in which case the Payment Event shall be the later date on which such action is completed) and (B) in the case of clause (z) such Adverse Recommendation Change or failure to confirm the Company Board Recommendation was not solely the result of the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

 

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 12.04, it shall also pay any costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with interest on any amount of the Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to 3% over the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such payment should have been made.

   

 Section 12.05 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

    ##### 

  

    

 (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 Section 12.07 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in the City of New York, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. 

  

 Section 12.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

EXHIBIT A 
 FORM OF AFFILIATE LETTER 

  

_____________________ 

   

_____________________ 

  

_____________________ 

    

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

    

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS GROUP, INC. (the " _Company_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_") of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). 

  

 I have been further advised that, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of _____________, 2010 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among the Company, STIFEL FINANCIAL CORP. (" _Parent_ ") and PTAS, INC. (" _Merger Subsidiary_ "), Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and I may be eligible to receive shares of common stock of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") in exchange in part for shares of common stock of the Company owned by me. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that, in the event I receive any Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger: 

  

 1. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock to be received by me pursuant to the Merger or any other securities that may be paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed thereon or with respect thereto or issued or delivered in exchange or substitution thereof (all such shares being referred as " _Control Securities_ ") in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 2. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Control Securities to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or with counsel for the Company. 

  

 3. I have been advised that any issuance of Parent Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be registered with the SEC on a registration statement on Form S-4 (the " _Parent S-4_ "). However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger is submitted to the stockholders of the Company for approval, I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of the Company, any sale or disposition by me of any of the Control Securities may only be made, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Act, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or pursuant to an exemption thereunder. I agree that I will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Control Securities unless (i) such sale, 

   ##### 

  

  

transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act for resale
(and that the Parent S-4 will not provide such registration); (ii) I provide
evidence of compliance with Rule 145(d)(1), in a letter in the form of _Annex
I_ hereto, or such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the
Act; or (iii) in the written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. 

   

 4. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Control Securities by me or on my behalf. 

  

 5. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents transfer agent with respect to the Control Securities and that there will be placed on any certificates for the Control Securities issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

   

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
applies. The shares represented by this certificate may only be sold or
otherwise transferred in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement
between the registered holder hereof and Stifel Financial Corp., a copy of
which agreement is on file at the principal offices of Stifel Financial
Corp." 

  

 6. I also understand that, unless the transfer by me of my Control Securities has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

   

"The sale of the shares represented by this certificate has not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and the shares were acquired from a person who received such shares
in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or
for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred
except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act." 

  

 It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect and the legends set forth in paragraphs (5) or (6), as the case may be, above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and the related stop transfer restrictions shall be lifted forthwith, if (i) any such Control Securities shall have been registered under the Act for sale, transfer or other disposition by me or on my behalf and are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of; (ii) I provide evidence that any such Control Securities are sold in accordance with the provisions of Rule 145(d)(1) promulgated under the Act in the form of a letter in the form of _Annex I_ hereto; (iii) if Parent meets the requirements of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act, if I provide a letter to the effect I am not and have not been for at least three months at the time an affiliate of Parent and have been the beneficial owner of the Parent Common Stock for at least six months (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations); or (iv) if I provide a letter that I am not and have not 

   ##### 

  

  

been for at least three months an affiliate of Parent and have been the
beneficial owner of the Parent Common Stock for at least one year (or such
other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations);
or (v) Parent shall have received a letter from the staff of the SEC, or a
written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to
the effect that the stock transfer restrictions and the legend are not
required. 

   

 My execution of this letter shall not be considered an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. 

  

 This letter shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 This letter shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
